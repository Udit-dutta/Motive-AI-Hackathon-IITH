            "Now that traditional, schedule-centric maintenance methods are becoming obsolete, fleet managers whose priorities have shifted more toward modernizing and improving fleet maintenance measures are becoming more interested in predictive maintenance. This article will thoroughly define predictive maintenance, address its many benefits, describe how it differs from preventive maintenance , and more. What is predictive maintenance? Predictive maintenance PdM is a proactive upkeep strategy that tracks vehicle and asset health and uses data science and analytics to forecast when vehicles and assets will need maintenance so they can be addressed before breakdowns occur. Also known as condition-based maintenance, predictive maintenance aims to boost the efficiency of a fleet and minimize downtimes and operational expenses over time. It uses sophisticated data analysis tools to detect warning signs of potential vehicle failures, so PdM requires detailed preparation in order to operate accurately. PdM tools uncover defects, identify potential malfunctions, and other issues that could negatively impact fleet health and disrupt operations. Keep your fleet on the road with preventive maintenance. PdM tools rely on a combination of sensory devices, the Internet of Things IoT , machine learning ML , and data models and analytics, among others, to assess a vehicle rsquo s condition. Below is an overview of how each tool or method contributes to the predictive maintenance process. Sensors or condition-monitoring devices. Sensors gather information related to the health and performance of your fleet . Depending on the tools used, you can obtain crucial details, such as vibration, temperature, pressure, and noise. Internet of Things. IoT converts the collected information into electronic signals that can be quantified and studied over time to forecast when the vehicle or asset will require maintenance. Machine learning. Machine learning technology uses collected data to analyze the behavior of a vehicle. Specifically, it lets you define health conditions and quality control metrics for every vehicle and asset component based on historical information. When it has sufficient data, it can quickly identify any anomalies in the performance of the vehicle or asset and make predictions regarding the overall health of the fleet and when operational disruptions may occur. Computerized maintenance management system CMMS . This solution automatically creates work orders for technicians when anomalies happen. CMMS helps optimize and streamline vehicle maintenance work because technicians are prompted to conduct maintenance even without manual requests. Flexible cloud architecture. This functionality allows the seamless integration of third-party apps for additional contextual information. Cloud computing capabilities make big data processing possible and give access to valuable data from any location or device. What is the difference between preventive and predictive maintenance? While preventive and predictive maintenance are both proactive vehicle upkeep strategies to help reduce vehicle breakdowns , they vary in specific ways. For instance, preventive maintenance is scheduled periodically or at regular intervals whether or not the vehicles need it. Although intended to keep vehicles in their best shape, the preventive maintenance method doesn rsquo t consider the current condition of the fleet. Predictive maintenance is done according to the condition of the fleet and, therefore, when vehicles actually require upkeep or maintenance activities. Preventive maintenance follows a calendar schedule and relies more on human observation. Its activities are prompted primarily by time-sensitive triggers yearly, monthly, weekly, etc. or vehicle usage e.g., an inspection every 5,000 miles traveled . Predictive maintenance depends heavily on live fleet performance analytics, including personnel observations along with other automated tools, to recognize or predict issues in their early stages. Predictive maintenance is prompted by data-based warnings to determine the vehicles rsquo upkeep needs and schedules. The primary difference between preventive and predictive maintenance is that preventive maintenance requires more human intervention with manual or electronic tools assisting technicians , while predictive maintenance minimizes manual interaction by automating most of the tasks with the help of modern technologies. Benefits of a predictive maintenance strategy Your fleet can benefit in countless ways when you have an effective predictive maintenance program in place. The following are some of the many benefits of a predictive maintenance strategy. Reduced risk Predictive maintenance tools gather and analyze relevant information from individual vehicle profiles and vehicle maintenance history, and because you rsquo re getting accurate vehicle health information, you minimize guesswork when inspecting errors and oversight. You can get relatively reliable estimates of risks involved because the predictive maintenance software uses quantifiable data, powerful analysis techniques, and precise calculations. From there, it recommends the next best steps and upkeep schedules to implement. With this, you rsquo re in a better position to decrease the likelihood of mechanical failures and accidents. Reduced downtimes Predictive maintenance programs significantly lessen vehicle downtime. By accurately identifying potential vehicle issues, you can avoid out-of-the-blue mechanical failures and reactive maintenance activities that disrupt operations. As you only schedule maintenance work when specific conditions are met and diagnostics are needed, you minimize premature upkeep and vehicle downtime. You also avoid replacing parts that are still usable and functional. All these boost fleet efficiencies, keep costs in line, and improve the operational availability of your vehicles. Extended vehicle and asset life cycles Through intelligent monitoring and data-supported upkeep suggestions, vehicles and assets are fixed before any predictable severe damages occur. This prevents needless downtimes or long, unforeseen repairs. As a result, you lessen their wear and tear, and vehicles can remain in their optimal conditions for a longer time, sometimes even beyond their average lifespans. Reduced operational expenditures Predictive maintenance programs help you optimize and intelligently plan how you allocate your resources and fleet-related expenditures, which can help to minimize maintenance expenses. Effective PdM maintenance means you rsquo re spending money on vehicle maintenance only when it rsquo s necessary. It may also prevent costly repairs from occurring and reduce service expenses by focusing on specific vehicle maintenance tasks as needed. You can precisely allocate your funds for inspections, parts replacement, and repairs verified to be necessary. By removing the guesswork, plus enhancing maintenance forecasts, you avoid wasting money. Contribution to a cleaner environment Well-maintained vehicles can perform optimally, enhance fuel economy, and reduce your carbon footprint on the planet. Through predictive maintenance, you can detect issues in advance or while they rsquo re still minor that can hurt your gas mileage. These include a clogged air filter, oxygen sensors with signs of defect, low tire pressure, etc. If you don rsquo t foresee and fix these issues, you can spend more fuel as you continue your driving operations and produce more carbon emissions. With predictive maintenance, you change oil only when you need to, reducing gasoline wastage. Features to look for in predictive maintenance tools and software When choosing predictive maintenance tools for your fleet, consider these features Risk identification The predictive maintenance software you choose must be able to detect critical events and provide actionable insights into those areas that need attention. It should have the capability to capture vast quantities of engine and system performance data, record external surroundings and driver behavior, along with storing vehicle usage metrics and other risk-related variables. Asset tracking Reliable predictive maintenance tools should improve visibility into fleet performance and monitor each vehicle or asset rsquo s status for potential defects and damages. The more robust PdM tools can trace failure statuses and recognize related patterns over time, enabling you to identify and target precisely which vehicles or components need timely upkeep and to meet those requirements. Data management Another must-have feature of predictive maintenance tools is organized data collection and management. The software should be able to gather all relevant information, define specific tracking metrics, and measure the data rsquo s impact on your fleet rsquo s maintenance requirements. Your predictive maintenance software must also have user-intuitive dashboards and features to present data in an easy-to-understand format. It should provide easy-to-understand visual and narrative reports, including summaries. The interface and navigation systems should be straightforward, allowing you to access the information you need easily and quickly. Additionally, the predictive maintenance software should also have the capability to synchronize all data from different departments and devices. With these features, you can quickly obtain and organize your data any way you need. This helps you make well-informed vehicle maintenance strategies and associated business decisions. Maintenance reminders Predictive maintenance already uses sophisticated technologies to determine and forecast your fleet rsquo s upkeep needs. A reliable predictive maintenance software must also provide automatic vehicle maintenance reminders . The function notifies you of approaching recommended and calendared maintenance activities based on pre-set monitoring metrics, machine-analyzed needs, and synced service records. Customizable DVIRs You should also consider a predictive maintenance tool that has built-in customizable electronic driver vehicle inspection reports DVIRs . This functionality simplifies inspection, maintenance, and reporting systems for fleet managers, drivers, technicians, and other concerned personnel. It also allows drivers to complete their DVIRs by choosing from the pre-populated options, adding comments, uploading photos, and instantly submitting reports.

            "Big news for those using 3G networks for their electronic logging devices ELDs mdash as telecom providers start phasing out their 3G network, many ELDs will need to be replaced. Not to worry though, this article has everything you need to know about the 3G sunset, the dates you can expect the sunset to happen, as well as how to make sure you stay compliant if your current device relies on a 3G network. What does the 3G sunset mean for ELD users on 3G networks? Starting in early 2022, mobile providers will no longer be supporting 3G networks. All 3G network providers are making this change to create more room for advanced network services. This means that older cell phones and electronic devices that rely on 3G will no longer be able to access and use data services. This is important for those who use electronic logging devices ELD on 3G networks. Once the sunset takes effect, those ELDs will no longer be supported, meaning any driver using these devices will no longer be in compliance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA regulations. The FMCSA Technical Specifications state that ELDs must continually record all required data elements and transfer the ELD output files. After the sunset, ELDs that rely on 3G networks won rsquo t meet the minimum requirements included in the FMCSA rsquo s technical specifications. Note ELDs that require 3G cellular data to support them will register a malfunction when the network is sunset, and will no longer be compliant with the ELD mandate rsquo s technical specifications. nbsp In accordance with the FMCSA ELD mandate, drivers have eight days barring an extension being granted to resolve the malfunction from the time it rsquo s registered. For the upcoming 3G sunset, the resolution will be a replacement of the ELD with a device that rsquo s compatible with 4G and above. There is no way to upgrade the old devices to support the contemporary cellular networks. Fleets and drivers need to be advised of the dates for the upcoming 3G sunset so they can be prepared once the changes go into effect by their mobile providers. Below are the dates for the sunset by network. Please note that the dates are for completion of the sunset, and networks will be starting the sunset sooner than these dates in most cases. The sunset dates are subject to change. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it rsquo s recommended to contact your mobile carrier. AT amp T 3G February 22, 2022 Sprint 3G T-Mobile March 31, 2022 Spring LTE T-Mobile June 30, 2022 T-Mobile 3G July 1, 2022 Verizon 3G December 31, 2022 Note Other 3G providers, such as Cricket, Boost, Straight Talk, and several Lifeline mobile service providers, utilize the AT amp T, Verizon, and T-Mobile 3G networks. What do you need to do before the 3G sunset? First, fleets and drivers need to make sure they rsquo re aware of the termination dates by network, the earliest being February 22, 2022. The FMCSA is encouraging all fleets subject to the ELD mandate to take action before the sunset begins to ensure there rsquo s no gap in compliance. Here are steps you can take to get ahead of the upcoming 3G sunset Confirm if your ELD is supported by a 3G network or not If you don rsquo t know what network supports your ELD, contact your ELD provider immediately. If your ELD doesn rsquo t rely on 3G, no further action is required. Ask your provider about their upgrade or replacement plan If your ELD does rely on a 3G network, evaluate whether your present ELD provides the functionality you need. Most legacy vendors do not offer the level of functionality you will find in Motive rsquo s end-to-end suite.Take any required actions as soon as possible to upgrade or replace your device. Note There may be a cost for upgrading to a device that supports a 4G or 5G network. Take the worry away and stay compliant with Motive rsquo s 1 ELD It rsquo s extremely important for fleets to get ahead of the curve prior to the 3G sunset deadline dates and adopt 4G and above technology early. Being proactive will help avoid any operational interruptions or violations. Ordering early will also help you get ahead of any ongoing supply chain delays or device shortages, which could impact your delivery date and jeopardize your compliance.

            "Drivers and companies that operate commercial vehicles are prioritizing vehicle and cargo safety. Yet trailer theft remains a rampant problem. Even as drivers and fleet safety managers make changes to prevent trailer theft, the thieves are regularly dreaming up new ways to target trailer cargo. After a quick overview of the current trailer theft environment, we share several trailer theft prevention solutions. How trailer theft has skyrocketed Trailer theft is an ongoing concern. Consider the latest available data from CargoNet There were 1,502 total theft events in 2020 compared with 1,106 in 2019 and 1,181 in 2018. Thefts specific to cargo reached 1,059 total events in 2020 compared with 758 in 2019 and 797 in 2018. Vehicle theft events reached 861 in 2020 compared to 676 in 2019 and 810 in 2018. In Canada and the United States, the average cargo theft was worth 166,334 in 2020 an increase of 27,045 from 2019 . Transport Topics reported some of the activity in 2020 was pandemic specific. Supply chain intelligence director Scott Martino said, ldquo In the U.S., full truckload thefts increased in 2020 by 25 , as criminals targeted shipments of medical supplies and household supplies. rdquo The Sensitech director noted cargo theft typically climbs during economic downturns. The numbers have remained relatively stable into 2021 with CargoNet reporting a total of 16 million in cargo stolen across the United States and Canada in Q2 2021. With that not-so-rosy picture in mind, let rsquo s turn our focus to the best trailer theft prevention advice, devices, and the benefits of a digital technology solution. What is the best way to secure a trailer from theft? The best way to secure a trailer from theft is being aware of the risk and staying diligent in prevention efforts. There are many proactive steps to take to help prevent trailer theft such as Installing a ball mount with a hitch lock Securing the latch with a coupler lock Placing secure keys in a secure location Installing straps or chains over the trailer Driving directly to the destination before uncoupling the trailer Locking the trailer where it rsquo s parked Removing the ball mount from the receiver hitch when the trailer is uncoupled Using digital technology to draw a geofence around the trailer to alert you if it moves Cargo theft prevention is also easier with technology to track vehicles and shipments. It rsquo s also a good idea to carefully screen new employees and thoroughly vet your supply chain partners. Overall, establishing a safety culture can help with both trailer and cargo theft prevention. Trailer theft prevention advice for drivers In addition to knowing the best way to prevent trailer theft, it rsquo s a good idea to share theft prevention advice with drivers. The key thing is to be mindful of threats. According to CargoNet rsquo s Q2 2021 data California, particularly Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside county, is the top state for reported cargo theft. Texas, Florida, and the Canadian province of Ontario are also high risk and especially demand a robust fleet risk management plan. Thefts at truck stops were the most common accounting for 17 of cargo thefts and more than 1.5 million in loss value followed by parking lots 16 . Thefts at warehouses decreased dramatically, from 64 thefts in Q2 2020 to just 30 thefts in Q2 2021. Based on this data, drivers should know to be more wary in certain regions and locations when the vehicle is stopped. CargoNet also identified consumer electronics and household major appliances as commonly stolen items followed by paper goods, furniture, and small appliances. Other trailer theft advice for drivers includes not making cargo an easy target for criminals. That means keeping trailers attached to the tractor and dropping off cargo only in secure, well-lit areas. At the same time drivers should avoid Leaving vehicles idling at stops or rest areas Discussing details of their cargo Revealing their route or destination Check out our five-point checklist for more on how to combat cargo theft . Along with changing their mindsets, drivers and fleet managers can help prevent trailer theft with both traditional anti-theft devices and new technologies. Trailer theft prevention devices There are many devices available to help prevent trailer theft. Common security devices to protect your trailer include Wheel clamps. Also used to keep a trailer in place on an incline, wheel clamps immobilize the trailer and serve as a visual deterrent and anti-theft device. Hitch locks. Inserting a hitch lock into the fastener hole of the receiver tube keeps the trailer more secure. Wheel locks. Immobilize the trailer rsquo s wheels by replacing lug nuts with locking wheel nuts that can only be removed with a special key. Security posts. Equipping a driver with a fold-down or removable post set in concrete can provide an anchor point for a trailer. You can also support trailer hitch theft prevention with digital tools such as GPS trackers, geofencing, and other features we rsquo ll discuss in the next section. What to do when a trailer is stolen Report it immediately. Fleet drivers will want to communicate quickly with their home office and involve law enforcement. You rsquo ll want to be able to provide as much information as possible about the last known location and what rsquo s missing. You rsquo ll also want to tap into the fleet network and ask other drivers to keep an eye out for your missing trailer on the road. Many local trucking associations also take postings of lost trailers. TruckPaper has a listing of stolen trailers online. If you rsquo re unable to locate the lost cargo or trailer, it rsquo s time to call your insurance company and file a claim. How to track trailers and assets with Motive rsquo s Asset Gateway One great way to prevent trailer theft? Know where your assets are at all times. All you need to do is attach a battery- or solar-powered device to the trailer that sends out a GPS tracking signal. Tracking software receives the signal and indicates where the trailer is on a map.

            "A priority for every fleet manager should be managing risk in construction projects. Risks to a construction company rsquo s fleet of vehicles and equipment can come in various forms, including operational expenses, driver safety, and equipment and vehicle maintenance. Risk management in construction projects can minimize the impact of adverse events and keep the project running smoothly. Let rsquo s take a closer look at what construction risk management is and how to maintain risk management as a fleet manager with the latest technology. What is construction risk management? Construction risk management is the process of evaluating and implementing procedures to reduce the impact of risks in construction projects. Risk analysis in construction involves thorough planning that allows fleet managers to identify, monitor, and mitigate risks as they arise. There rsquo s a lot to consider when creating a comprehensive risk management plan. Make sure you rsquo re considering the various areas of a complex construction project that could produce risk. Are there different types of risk in construction? For those in construction looking to implement a successful risk management strategy, knowing where you rsquo re vulnerable to risk is key. You must be aware of anything and everything that could be potentially harmful to the success of your projects. There can be many types of risks in construction. In general, risk is anything that will delay the project or create further costs. There are many components to manage. These can include heavy equipment, contractors working in precarious situations, complicated logistics, and safety hazards. To create a risk management plan, it rsquo s essential to know the different areas in which risk can occur. Safety A report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor found that fatal work injuries in construction and extraction companies increased by 6 in 2019 . As you know, construction is inherently risky. And your crew is your most valuable resource. Nothing can be done without them. They rsquo re also subject to safety hazards, because many of their tasks can be dangerous. These hazards can result in overexertion, illness, equipment accidents, and, in some cases, fatalities. Legal There are legal risks. These can include regulations, code violations, and contract terms disputes with your clients, vendors, and subcontractors. Any of these constraints can send your construction project off track. This area of risk exposure can delay projects and increase costs. Financial Often the result of a lack of proper planning, financial risks can lead to cash shortages that can slow projects down, or stop them completely. When project delays and stops happen, legal risk can also be at play when contracts aren rsquo t fulfilled in time. While this isn rsquo t typically the first risk that springs to mind when it comes to construction projects, it rsquo s a vital risk to be aware of. Environmental Environmental risks can rsquo t be avoided. These types of risks are events such as floods, earthquakes, and other kinds of natural disasters that are an ever-present threat. These environmental risks can make work inaccessible and slow down project progress. Another potential harmful result of inclement weather is the risk of damage to machinery or materials, which inevitably delays projects and adversely affects operations. Project Project risks are universal project management risks associated with managing any project. When trying to effectively manage project risks, 66 of contractors report that they have challenges. Any risks that negatively impact overall project performance put the entire project at risk of failure. This catch-all category involves risk areas such as General delays Poor project oversight Lack of communication Problems with scheduling Conflicts within the team Understanding contractor risk management in construction Today, contractors are often used to complete construction work. Because hiring contractors is common managers might assume that it comes with relatively low risk. This isn rsquo t always the case. Contracted companies or workers aren rsquo t always prepared to limit project risks. So, be sure to carefully vet potential contractors before working with them. If those in construction risk management don rsquo t put enough thought into how to prevent common problems caused by contractors, they expose themselves to potential project delays and financial losses. Accidents on the job, work delays, low-quality work, lack of warranty, and going over budget are just some of the risks that hiring companies assume when working with contractors. As a manager in construction who oversees risk management, it rsquo s impossible to have a contractor assume all of the risks that come with performing what can be dangerous work. Ultimately, responsibility falls on the company that rsquo s running the project. Some hiring companies might want to pass costs from risk incident fines or extensive equipment repairs onto contractors. But this isn rsquo t possible very often. There are a few things you can do to make sure you rsquo re prepared for the risks that come along with hiring contractors for your construction projects Prepare for possible risks throughout the entire contract period. Make sure you rsquo re documenting the work contractors are doing. Spend time making a robust risk response plan. How to undertake a construction risk analysis as a fleet manager As a fleet manager looking to complete a risk analysis, there are a few steps you can take to make sure the process goes as smoothly as possible Undertake a risk analysis First, you should identify any risks that are apparent to you as you begin the planning process. Begin identifying risks as soon as possible so you have as much time as you can to manage the risks that arise. Getting members of the team together to discuss potential risks is a good way to start the risk identification process. Look back at past projects and create a comprehensive list of all possible risks identified. Keep the list fluid, but make sure you create a cut-off time for this stage of the risk analysis process so you can make enough time for other stages. Organize risks in levels of importance Not all risks are equal. Some are more likely to occur. Others less so. You should categorize risks based on a few things to what extent the potential risk will impact your business, and the likelihood of the potential risk happening. Use data where you can to help find the answers. Risks that have a higher chance of occurring, and that have a big impact, should be handled first. Other lower priority risks can be taken care of once the big items are handled. Create a plan and strategy Creating a plan and strategy for risk management should be the next thing you tackle. Your plan needs to be robust and include how you rsquo ll respond to incidents and who will be responsible for each task included in your response plan. Your plan should also prioritize each risk from high to low, and include information on which resources will be needed to effectively mitigate the risk. Put the plan in place This is where you implement a contingency plan that will reduce the likelihood and impact of the risks you identified earlier. The top priority, of course, is those you defined as highly likely and having the greatest impact. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you work to finalize your plan Software is your friend. For risks when it comes to your vehicle and equipment fleet, software like Motive can help you ensure drivers are safe on the road and vehicles are always properly maintained. Software that automatically alerts you of risks can be a huge asset as you begin to handle larger and more complex projects. Make sure that members of your team are involved when you rsquo re starting to put your plan into place. Risk management isn rsquo t a solo activity, but a team effort. Make sure all action items and dependencies in your plan have clear owners. Share your plan with crew members and stakeholders so everyone is on the same page. And be sure to take into account the operating procedures and priorities of different team functions.

            "Commercial vehicle speeding can cause accidents and increase fleet costs. It doesn rsquo t help the industry rsquo s reputation either. Fleet and compliance managers actively promote safety solutions to combat speeding concerns. But talking about it isn rsquo t enough. This article addresses technology that helps fleets monitor, analyze, and take action on driver behavior. What are the dangers of driver speeding? In 2019, 5,005 large trucks were involved in fatal crashes, up 2 from 2018. In the same time period, the large truck involvement rate large trucks involved in fatal crashes per 100 million miles traveled by large trucks increased 4 from 1.61 to 1.67, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA . Any vehicle going too fast is at greater risk of a crash. Commercial vehicles, in particular , because of their size and high center of gravity and weight, take longer to stop and can be tipped or thrown off balance by turns when speeding. A truck can jackknife when the speeding driver has a heavy load that shifts during transport and the truck is unstable. Additionally, commercial trucks are more likely to cause a severe collision. Speeding has a negative impact on your business bottom line too. The speeding driver will run up fuel costs, can cause more wear-and-tear on the vehicles, and require more maintenance. Your fleet rsquo s brand can also suffer damages if others on the road associate your drivers with high-risk behaviors. According to the American Trucking Associations , ldquo A truck traveling at 75 mph consumes 27 more fuel than one going 65 mph so limiting truck speed to 65 mph would save 2.8 billion gals. rdquo Knowing that, you have to be wondering how to stop speeding drivers. Before we get to that, it helps to understand what causes drivers to speed. Lear how to reduce the five riskiest fleet driver behaviors . What causes commercial drivers to speed? Poorly planned routes Truck drivers keep to a tight schedule. They face limits on the number of hours they can drive and when they need to take breaks, yet they also want to complete deliveries on time. As a result, a poorly planned route can contribute to trucker speeding. A well-planned route takes time, road condition, and potential delays into account. Considering these in advance can help take off the stress about making a timely delivery from the mind of the driver. Ingrained driving habits Drivers recognize that speeding is a safety concern. Yet, in a survey by the National Safety Council, 64 still said they rsquo re ldquo comfortable speeding . rdquo This attitude needs to change. Coaching and education can make a difference but technology helps too. Distracted driving The speeding driver may not even realize that they rsquo re speeding when driving distracted. A driver talking on a cell phone or eating while driving can unwittingly pick up speed. You rsquo ll probably cover distracted driving when onboarding your commercial fleet. Still, even the best drivers can slip into high-risk behaviors, negatively affecting your fleet risk management . That rsquo s when a driver safety solution can help. These common causes of truck driver speeding can be combated. Read on to learn more about how to reduce speeding. How are speeding citations calculated? Like a teenager asking what the consequence would be before deciding whether or not to break a rule, you may get asked ldquo How much is a speeding ticket in a semi-truck rdquo or ldquo How much is a speeding ticket in a commercial vehicle? rdquo Of course, the answers will vary based on context. Yet, to generally answer ldquo how much is a speeding ticket for truck drivers rdquo we can say that, while the dollar amount varies from state to state, the penalty will often consider Driving speed Posted speed Where the speeding was recorded Driving conditions at the time Additionally, beyond the fine, a commercial driver rsquo s license CDL speeding ticket can also mean Disqualification from driving. Two or more serious violations ldquo within a three-year period will lead to a disqualification for 60 days, and a subsequent conviction within three years will get you a 120-day disqualification. rdquo 50 higher Negligent Operator Treatment System NOTS points for the same speeding ticket conviction compared to non-CDL peers Compliance, Safety, Accountability CSA score point severity reflecting the amount of speed over the limit Another common question is ldquo Can fleets face action over speeding drivers? rdquo A lawyer filing suit after a truck accident will typically bring the initial suit against the speeding truck driver rsquo s company. Determining liability for the different parties will be part of the legal action. Top questions that need answers include whether the truck driver was operating the vehicle conscientiously and if there were any equipment-based or mechanical malfunctions. How can fleets reduce driver speeding? The National Surface Transportation Safety Center for Excellence NSTSCE in 2019 surveyed nine carriers that had experienced significant improvements in safety and concluded ldquo a strong safety culture, advanced technologies, training and management practices all are key. rdquo There was no single fix that made a significant difference but here are some of the areas you can change Be proactive about safety Addressing driver safety begins first with educating drivers about the dangers. The truck driver needs to know to adjust speed when driving in heavy traffic, construction zones, or when there rsquo s low visibility or wet pavement due to rain, sleet, snow or fog. The FMCSA further cautions truck drivers to slow down on curves which often have reduced speed limits , on exit and entrance ramps, and when driving with a full load. Driver coaching and incentive programs emphasizing a culture of safety can help. Both are made easier with fleet software. Fleet managers can easily run reports to identify the drivers with the greatest number of speeding events. They can also create rules to get notifications of drivers speeding or driving aggressively and provide additional training for those drivers. Invest in AI dashcams AI dashcams can help fleets stop accidents and proactively detect unsafe driving such as speeding, and can instantly alert drivers to modify their behaviors. AI dashcams also provide data to calculate driver risk scores to help predict future accidents. Motive rsquo s DRIVE risk score objectively measures risk against its broader network of over 400,000 vehicles to give you a holistic understanding of your drivers rsquo performance over time. The scoring incorporates safety events like speeding to determine a driver rsquo s accurate risk profile. Additionally, you can use the dashcam video evidence to protect innocent drivers and avoid the fallout for your fleet from a potential nuclear verdict. Adopt GPS tracking technology Installing GPS tracking technology can easily improve route planning. Real-time tracking and maps give managers the ability to proactively reroute trucks based on road and weather conditions and vehicle location. Sharing vehicle locations also enables accurate ETA calculation and can support exceptional customer service by providing real-time alerts along the way. At Mohawk Materials, GPS tracking has made for a more efficient operation. ldquo Before, my plant managers would have to call to ask where the truck is and would have to wait 30 minutes for the next refresh to give an update, rdquo says owner Wes Beck . ldquo Now, they don rsquo t have to call me at all. They can check right on their phone and find out where that truck is. rdquo The ability to geofence or create virtual boundaries can also raise driver awareness when they rsquo re in a school or construction zone. They rsquo ll receive alerts to remind them to drive with greater care, at slower speeds. How Motive rsquo s AI-powered safety platform helps reduce speeding Motive rsquo s safety platform offers several features focused on addressing speeding concerns and reducing accident costs Real-time in-cab alerts to drivers with dashcams Real-time email alerts so fleet managers can act quickly to correct driver behavior Centralized view of driver speeding events in the Fleet Dashboard provides actionable context for immediate coaching Speeding is also one of the driver behaviors that impact the driver rsquo s DRIVE risk score . Motive rsquo s fleet safety solution automates post-trip coaching using video to correct driver behaviors based on the trends observed on the trip. Plus, Motive rsquo s advanced event intelligence and in-house safety team analyzes dashcam videos within seconds of incidents to provide a greater understanding of context and severity.

            "When the construction industry paused operations during the 2020 shutdown, more than 1 million workers were left without jobs. Though nearly 80 of those workers have returned to the industry , some have not. And they may never return. To meet surging demand, construction firms will need to hire 1 million workers through 2023, the Associated Builders and Contractors estimates . As 40 of the current construction workforce prepares to retire by 2031 , recruiting the next generation becomes that much more vital. Tech-savvy Millennials and Gen Zers hold the key to construction rsquo s future. And construction firms are prepared to attract them with the most innovative tools. ldquo The exodus of construction workers during the pandemic caused construction firms to become more efficient with the help of the latest technologies, rdquo says Brian Turmail, Vice President, Public Affairs amp Strategic Initiatives, Associated General Contractors of America. ldquo As the construction industry seeks to attract younger workers, the technologies that contractors invested in during the pandemic are becoming their most valuable assets. rdquo Explore Motive s fleet management technology for construction. What drives Millennials and Generation Z? Millennials, the generation born roughly between 1980 and 1995, have a reputation for being open-minded, ambitious, and efficient. As the first digitally native generation, more than 90 of Millennials own a smartphone and 86 of them use social media. Driven by the instant gratification that instant messaging provides, the Millennials rsquo communication style has been described as ldquo open and often rdquo . And they bring that expectation with them to work. Additionally, Millennials tend to be more socially conscious, active, and eager to contribute. Be it for the good of the team or the good of the world. Generation Z shares Millennials rsquo digital prowess and keen social consciousness. What rsquo s different, generally speaking, is that Generation Z rsquo s identity is more tied to their online life. A staggering 58 of Gen Zers can rsquo t handle being offline for more than four hours per day. Also, as the most internet-dependent and racially diverse generation, Generation Z values a work-life balance, inclusion, and the latest innovations. Born between 1996 and 2015, Gen Z was slated to enter the most competitive workforce in many generations. It was a period characterized by record-low unemployment until COVID-19 came along. Fortunately, Gen Z is a resilient group. Known for their optimism, they now find themselves in demand. ldquo Unlike Baby Boomers and Gen Xers, the younger generations have seen all that technology can help them achieve in their daily lives, rdquo explains Troy Guevara, Construction Technologist at Digitek Solutions, a construction software supplier. As a consultant, Guevara has seen which recruiting methods work and which don rsquo t. ldquo If a company isn rsquo t using the latest and greatest in tech, it rsquo s going to be a turnoff to Millennials and Gen Z, rdquo he says. But what is the ldquo latest and greatest rdquo in construction technology? Construction safety technology is among the most innovative When attracting a generation of young, underskilled workers to the construction industry, it rsquo s important to train them through innovative safety technologies. The more advanced the solutions, the greater the appeal to Gen Z and Millennials. Innovations such as exoskeleton suits will be just the sort of equipment to attract them. ldquo Like Sigourney Weaver in lsquo Aliens, rsquo exoskeleton suits are a great fit for Millennials and Generation Z workers, rdquo Turmail says. ldquo These actually exist now, and workers wear them to avoid being injured when operating heavy equipment. Using a jackhammer while encased in a space-age suit, I don rsquo t know about you, but that rsquo s cool to me. rdquo For workers in their twenties and thirties who want to use the latest gadgets at work, ldquo wearables rdquo are a big draw. The sensor-laden hard hats, boots, and watches that fall into the wearables bucket protect construction workers from injury and alert them to nearby dangers. According to MarketWatch, the global wearable technology market in 2019 was valued at about 28 billion. Through 2027, it is expected to grow more than 15 . The popularity of wearables can be attributed to their effectiveness in monitoring workers rsquo health, detecting falls, and saving lives. To a younger generation, wearables also happen to be undeniably alluring. ldquo Wearables are just one example of how construction workers can use technology they find appealing and benefit from it at the same time, rdquo Turmail says. ldquo Wearables alert workers to a bulldozer behind them as if to say, lsquo Watch your back. rsquo You could wear a smartwatch that measures your heartbeat and core body temperature, ensuring you rsquo re getting the right number of breaks and hydrating. By alerting workers to imminent risks, wearables keep construction workers safe and healthy on the job. rdquo Millennials have been perceived as impulsive and daring, but one study says otherwise. Seventy-six percent of Millennials surveyed said safety concerns led them to pass up certain experiences. And 90 of Millennials reported using their smartphones, at least in part, to ensure safety. ldquo Millennials rsquo concern for personal safety is further evidenced by a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association, rdquo writes Forbes . ldquo It reveals that an overwhelming majority of millennials cite personal safety as a top concern in the workplace and elsewhere. rdquo The latest safety innovations can only ease Millennials rsquo concerns. ldquo Safety technology affords construction workers the confidence that they rsquo re going to be safe, and I will tell you, that attracts a lot of people, rdquo Guevara says. ldquo The more innovative your safety technologies are, the more they rsquo re going to bring in the next generation of workers. rdquo Driven by artificial intelligence AI and computer vision, the Motive AI Dashcam is one piece of camera-based technology that helps employees stay safe at work. For those who drive as part of their jobs, the AI Dashcam alerts drivers of unsafe behavior in real time, helping to improve driver awareness and transform the safety of fleet operations. Dashcams are an especially important tool to monitor Millennials and Generation Z, as 75 of them prefer texting to other forms of communication. As inexperienced construction workers learn to drive large vehicles, such as cement mixers, dashcams can alert younger operators to the risks of cell phone use at the wheel. Learning with AI that rsquo s focused on preventing accidents is exactly the kind of techMillennials and Generation Z workers want. At the end of a trip, drivers can coach themselves on improvement areas by reviewing AI Dashcam footage in the Motive Driver App. Self-coaching allows inexperienced construction workers to develop the safety habits and skills they need to grow in their careers. Read Psychological safety in construction and beyond . Attract talent through tech that boosts productivity and efficiency Productivity and safety may seem distinct from one another, but the two are closely linked. ldquo At its simplest, the more you can protect against incidents on the job site, the more productive you rsquo ll be, rdquo Turmail explains. Pre-construction technologies that drive productivity and efficiency are redefining what it means to work in construction. Virtual reality VR goggles, for example, enable workers to ldquo walk through rdquo a building they rsquo re constructing and see it as it exists in virtual reality. ldquo When contractors are building with the help of virtual reality, they can identify all of the problems they would encounter in real life and eliminate them before they ever turn the first piece of dirt, rdquo Turmail says. ldquo They can say, lsquo I have a hot water line right there and I need to move that. If a space is going to be too narrow to walk through, construction workers can widen it. They can use robots to laser-scan everything they rsquo ve built. It all works together to help workers ensure that they rsquo re not about to execute on the wrong thing or the dangerous thing. rdquo Similar to virtual reality programs, building information modeling BIM has become the most commonly used technology in the construction industry, according to Construction Business Owner Magazine . BIM is a collaborative process that allows architects, engineers, developers, and contractors to plan and construct a building within one 3D digital model. BIM empowers designers to make informed decisions during the life cycle of a project, from planning and design through construction and operations. Seventy-three percent of U.S. contractors surveyed by Dodge Data amp Analytics say they use BIM, and 79 of them say they use it on more than 30 of their projects. Cloud computing in BIM allows users to take projects, models, and drawings with them anywhere, creating just the sort of efficiency younger generations desire. With their efficient management of approval workflows, software programs such as ProCore appeal to Millennials and Generation Z for their efficiency. Step-by-step approvals from architects, project managers, and engineers lead to fewer design changes and more streamlined processes. Procore also facilitates easy document sharing among teams, allowing the documents to be saved and accessed directly in the software. ldquo Millennials and Generation Z workers want cloud technology that is handy, available, quick, and easy, rdquo says Guevara. ldquo Generation Z is as mobile-centric as it gets, so any mobile, cloud-based solutions you can allow them to work with will keep them engaged and productive. rdquo Guevara cautions that having software programs that help with project management are not enough if the programs don rsquo t communicate with each other. ldquo If workers in the field are clocking their time in a mobile device, but the mobile device doesn rsquo t connect to a company rsquo s accounting payroll, firms have traded one problem for another, rdquo he cautions. ldquo Without system integration, firms aren rsquo t going to be able to manage anything. It rsquo s like saying, lsquo Now I rsquo m watering that piece of grass, but I have to pick up the hose and water another part of the grass. rsquo The key is finding systems that connect and communicate with accounting. That rsquo s how to maximize efficiency. rdquo In this competitive job market, recruiters who can offer roles with leading-edge tech will attract younger workers. ldquo Employers and workers are all looking for that productivity increase, rdquo Guevara says. ldquo Firms are finding efficiencies wherever they can through technology. It rsquo s going to help them draw young people in. rdquo Now that you rsquo ve gained insight into how to attract the next generation of talent, get the latest tips on how to retain top talent .\n",

            "Saying something rsquo s ldquo heavy rdquo typically means it rsquo s going to bring everyone down. But when it comes to heavy-haul trucking, there rsquo s cause for lightness. After all, the heavy-duty trucks market was valued at 190.47 billion in 2020, and is expected to reach 280.54 billion by 2026. That said, we rsquo ll explain what heavy-haul trucking is and answer questions about how to get into heavy hauling. The heavy-duty market was shut down by COVID-19, but a rebound is in the works. According to Mordor Intelligence , the market is expected to register a compound annual growth rate of around 7.34 between 2021-2026. What is heavy-haul trucking? Heavy-duty trucks are commercial vehicles integral to commercial activities such as transportation, agriculture, construction , and more. Heavy-haul trucking transports oversized items such as industrial machinery, military or farming equipment, and construction materials. Since the trucks transport heavy loads , these shipments require special handling, optimized routing, and additional permits. Thanks to the heavier size and weight, the driver can rsquo t just get out on the road and drive from point A to point B as they might with a typical cargo load. This leads us to the next question What is a heavy load? What is a heavy load? The definition can vary across states , but as far as the federal government is concerned cargo is classified as a heavy load when it exceeds 80,000 pounds of gross vehicle weight 20,000 pounds of single axle weight 34,000 pounds of tandem axle weight To protect bridges, the number and spacing of axles is another consideration. The Federal Highway Administration uses this formula to make this calculation W 500 LN N-1 12N 36 W overall gross weight on any group of two or more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds. L distance in feet between the extreme of any group of two or more consecutive axles. N number of axles in the group under consideration. Simple enough, right? Since the standard highway lane is 12 feet wide, loads exceeding 8.5 feet wide are considered oversize and often require a state permit. Are there restrictions for heavy-hauling? Heavy-haul trucking calls for particular documentation and permitting. Fleet managers will need to get these squared away before sending drivers out on the road. Different states, cities, and counties will restrict the amount of time an oversized freight can travel and during what hours of the day. Depending on the commodity shipping as the heavy load, there could be added permits required for the cargo as well. If you rsquo re moving a shipment across state lines, know that the regulations vary from state to state. Understanding the heavy-haul permit State permits generally reflect local terrain, population density, environment, and laws. Permits can be issued within three to five days, but are generally for that one specific load within a particular time frame. Permit prices can range from 15 to 70 depending on the state, route, destination, and size of the load, and may also require a processing fee. Allow yourself plenty of time to acquire the proper heavy-haul permits. Are there any additional requirements for heavy-haul trucking? Heavy-haul trucking can require drivers to take special routes and power lines may need to be lifted or obstacles may need to be removed. Even without these kinds of special considerations, though, there are some added requirements typical of oversized and overweight loads. Safety flags These fluorescent orange or red flags are typically placed at the outermost corners of the heavy-load truck to help drivers and others on the road gauge clearance. Lights Some states require you to equip heavy load vehicles with rotating yellow LED lights. When traveling at night or in low visibility conditions, lights can also be required to replace the safety flags. Escort vehicles Escort vehicles or pilot cars travel with the heavy-haul trucks. Some states may even require a police escort for super loads over 16 feet wide . The need for escort will be decided by The type of load hauled Load size Route of travel e.g., crossing state lines and bridges or driving on interstates and side streets Banners The yellow ldquo oversized load rdquo banner is placed on the front and back of the vehicle carrying the heavy load. Sometimes a ldquo wide load rdquo banner can be used in place of the oversized load. Typically, the banners are sold as reversible signs to enhance your flexibility. How to get into heavy-hauling Billions of dollars in goods are shipped in the United States each year. Heavy-haul loads are just part of that market, but this niche remains a lucrative one. Getting started in heavy-hauling and growing a successful trucking business requires Selecting the target market Identifying your heavy-haul rates per mile Creating a business plan Determining legal requirements Finding business funding Buying the necessary assets and insuring them Preparing trucks for the road Finding and training drivers for heavy haul Establishing fleet processes Growing your client base Find out more about becoming an owner-operator in our blog ldquo 7 Things You Need to Know If You Want to Be An Owner-Operator. rdquo Or read how Chad Boblett started his own business and has been thriving for a decade now.

            "In this Brave New World, the relationship between drivers and the tools they use, as well as with their fleets, is rapidly changing. As with any evolving technology, some may resist the changes this progress represents, but they would be wise to embrace it. Motive rsquo s AI-powered dashcam is revolutionizing fleet management and compliance for both drivers and fleets. Making this innovation possible, in collaboration with Ambarella , is the nexus in which high-quality imagery and high-quality data intersect to provide a more complete and accurate picture of driver behavior and performance. On a recent Fleet Equipment Magazine podcast , Motive rsquo s director of product management, Abhishek Gupta, and Ambarella rsquo s senior director of marketing, Senya Pertsel, sat down to discuss how their combined efforts have resulted in the next generation of cutting-edge dashcams. Here are some of the key takeaways Forget 20 20 ndash hindsight now comes in 1440p resolution It rsquo s all about camera reliability and image quality. Motive rsquo s AI Dashcam leads the market in both respects with long-lasting battery backup and crisp, 1440p resolution footage that drivers can access when they need it most. Drivers have to travel through a constantly-changing landscape in which clear visibility isn rsquo t always guaranteed. High-dynamic range situations such as direct sunlight or going through a dark tunnel can create challenges even for the most experienced drivers. The Motive AI Dashcam employs an image-processing engine capable of creating consistent quality images across all of these shifting variables to provide the most detailed record of their travels. The more mileage drivers clock, the more hours of footage they capture. Powerful video compression is instrumental in order to stream and store this overwhelming amount of data. Motive rsquo s AI Dashcam utilizes Ambarella rsquo s robust processors to achieve incredibly efficient compression while maintaining the sharpest high-definition image quality, so every second of every mile is captured with stunning clarity. Preventing accidents before they happen Accidents happen. On average , there are approximately 18,510 car crashes per day in the U.S. alone. In fact, according to The National Safety Council , auto fatalities are on the rise despite less mileage being clocked by drivers. With entire businesses on the line, it rsquo s vital that fleets apply technology to help prevent these accidents in the first place, as well as exonerate their drivers when they rsquo re clearly not at fault. Of course, hazardous conditions can just as easily occur within the cab as on the road, which is why these dashcams are equipped with advanced AI detection. These algorithms not only alert drivers to potentially dangerous traffic events, but also their own distracted behavior. After all, taking eyes off the road for even a split second can result in both harm to the driver and financial loss. Some sobering statistics to keep in mind The average cost of a large truck crash involving a fatality is 3.6 million A crash with injuries costs almost 200,000 The average cost of all large truck crashes is about 91,000 per crash It rsquo s simple When fleets implement the latest camera technology, they invest in their drivers, their business, and everyone else on the road. Removing subjectivity from the equation Any driver will tell you no two harsh-braking events are alike. Which is precisely why there always needs to be a dependable record of exactly what happens and why. By leveraging the immense amount of data collected hourly from vehicles on the road, Motive is able to create a detailed, contextual map that allows fleets to understand everything from road conditions and traffic patterns to geography and weather. This aggregated data is used to analyze every event and enables management to determine how common, or rare, an event is for that specific time and place. For example, a harsh-braking event in a congested city tunnel is more likely to occur than a wide-open rural road in the afternoon. The quality of these events is measured alongside the quantity, which is crucial when it comes to generating a Safety Score that accurately reflects the context of any driver rsquo s performance. Motive has an in-house safety team that analyzes all of this footage to ensure their customers can use it to coach their drivers and improve, or reward, their behavior accordingly. Many fleets don rsquo t have the staff to deal with all this data, so this expert review team helps them process it and apply it as needed. Context is a vital commodity when it comes to deliberating cause and effect on the road. It rsquo s about improving human relationships For all this talk about advanced this and cutting-edge that , it rsquo s easy to lose sight of this technology rsquo s most important feature helping drivers perform at their very best and safest . The AI-powered dashcams are in no way designed or intended to invade the privacy of drivers, but rather assist them when they need it and reward them for jobs well done. Supporting this mission is the aforementioned Safety Score. These proprietary scores evaluate driver performance over time, accurately measuring driver risk across more than 15 unsafe and positive driving behaviors. The objective is to build a holistic understanding of your drivers rsquo performance, help you put risks into context, improve fleet risk management , and focus on the most pressing issues such as reducing accidents and ultimately lowering insurance costs . In fact, these Safety Scores are five times more predictive of future accidents than the industry rsquo s leading safety score. Additionally, drivers and their managers have the ability to communicate directly through the app with 24 7 live-streaming capabilities, as inclement weather and mechanical issues rarely adhere to standard business hours. Any questions or concerns can be addressed immediately whenever they arise. And when drivers don rsquo t have to worry about all the what-ifs of the road, they can focus on doing what they do best keeping our economy moving forward. A dashcam for everyone This cost-effective, out-of-the-box solution is designed to assist a wide range of industries, not just trucking companies. Fleets of all shapes and sizes can benefit from utilizing this user-friendly technology , regardless of how far they drive or how many vehicles they have on the road. And because of this platform rsquo s flexibility, it enables Motive and Ambarella to build a lot of future functionality quickly as new needs must inevitably be met.\n",

            "Speed limit laws in the United States started in 1901. Connecticut legislated a maximum speed of 12 mph in cities and 15 mph on country roads. More widespread adoption of speed limits started in the early 1970s amid anxiety over rising fuel prices. A national speed limit of 55 mph was established under President Richard Nixon in 1974. The move saw America s traffic fatality rate per million miles traveled drop from 4.28 in 1972 to 2.73 in 1983. Still, as fuel costs dropped, the national maximum speed limit on interstates rose to 65 mph. In 1995, Congress gave states the power to set their own maximum speed limits. What is the fastest speed limit in the U.S.? The big question is, What is the highest speed limit in the U.S.? We may not have an Autobahn in this country, but there s a toll road in Texas that lets drivers travel 85 mph. State Highway 130 stretches between Austin and San Antonio. Otherwise, since 1995, 35 states have increased their freeway speed limit to 70 mph or higher. U.S. speed limits by state Now that you know where to find the highest speed limit in the U.S., let s look at other U.S. speed limits. Ranging from 55 to 85 mph, the maximum speed limit for trucks varies from state to state. The following table, edited from The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHS and the Highway Loss Data Institute HLDI , captures variations in highway speed limits nationwide. State Rural interstates mph Urban interstates mph Other limited access roads mph Other roads mph Alabama 70 65 65 65 Alaska 65 55 65 55 Arizona 75 65 65 65 Arkansas 75 65 75 65 California 70 65 70 65 Colorado 75 65 65 65 Connecticut 65 55 65 55 Delaware 65 55 65 55 District of Columbia n a 55 n a 25 Florida 70 65 70 65 Georgia 70 70 65 65 Hawaii 60 60 55 45 Idaho 75 80 on specified roads 75 80 on specified roads 70 70 Illinois 70 55 65 55 Indiana 70 55 60 55 Iowa 70 55 70 65 Kansas 75 75 75 65 Kentucky 65 65 65 55 Louisiana 75 70 70 65 Maine 75 75 75 60 Maryland 70 70 70 55 Massachusetts 65 65 65 55 Michigan 70 75 on specified roads 70 70 55 Minnesota 70 65 65 60 Mississippi 70 70 70 65 Missouri 70 60 70 65 Montana 80 65 70 70 Nebraska 75 70 70 65 Nevada 80 65 70 70 New Hampshire 65 70 on specified roads 65 55 55 New Jersey 65 55 65 55 New Mexico 75 75 65 55 New York 65 65 65 55 North Carolina 70 70 70 55 North Dakota 75 75 70 65 Ohio 70 65 70 55 Oklahoma 75 80 on specified roads 70 70 70 Oregon 65 70 on specified roads 55 65 65 Pennsylvania 70 70 70 55 Rhode Island 65 55 55 55 South Carolina 70 70 60 55 South Dakota 80 80 70 70 Tennessee 70 70 70 65 Texas 75 80 or 85 on specified roads 75 75 75 Utah 75 80 on specified roads 65 75 65 Vermont 65 55 50 50 Virginia 70 70 65 55 Washington 70 75 on specified roads 60 60 60 West Virginia 70 55 65 55 Wisconsin 70 70 70 55 Wyoming 75 80 on specified roads 75 80 on specified roads 70 70 Are speed limits for trucks different? The speed limit for trucks is different in specific states. When wondering what is the speed limit for semi-trucks on your route, you ll want to be aware of the following variations in commercial truck speed limits by state. Commercial truck speed limits by state Arkansas limits trucks to 70 mph on rural interstates and other limited access rates. California limits trucks to 55 mph on all interstates and roads. Idaho limits trucks to 70 mph on rural interstates and 65 mph on urban interstates. Indiana limits trucks to 65 mph on rural interstates. Michigan limits trucks to 65 mph on rural interstates. Montana limits trucks to 70 mph on rural interstates. Oregon limits trucks to 70 mph on rural interstates. Washington limits trucks to 60 mph on rural interstates. The speed limits for semi-trucks can be impacted by cargo. Alabama limits trucks to 55 mph for hazardous cargo such as explosives. Keep an eye out for new legislation that would limit the speed of heavy-duty commercial trucks nationwide. The measure has been in the works for a decade, but the bipartisan Cullum Owings Large Truck Safe Operating Speed Act of 2019 directs the Department of Transportation DOT to require all new trucks to be equipped with regulators that would limit the speed to 65 mph. What are the highway speed limits accomplishing? The increase in speed limits over the last 40 years has increased highway fatalities. According to the IIHS, more than 33,000 fatal accidents between 1993 and 2013 could be linked to increased speed limits. Limiting speed is also believed to have environmental benefits. Lower rates of speed mean greater fuel efficiency and lower carbon emissions. nbsp What are the speed limits in residential areas? The speed limit in residential areas also changes by state. This chart, edited from MIT , captures the variations. When the numbers are in parentheses, there is no special residential speed limit under state law and the indicated state speed limit is in effect if signs are not posted. Alabama, 30 Hawaii, n a Massachusetts, 30 New Mexico, 35 South Dakota, 25 Alaska, 25 Idaho, 35 Michigan, 25 New York, 55 Tennessee, 65 Arizona, 25 Illinois, 30 Minnesota, 25-30 North Carolina, 35 Texas, 30 Arkansas, 30 Indiana, 30 Mississippi, 65 North Dakota, 25 Utah, 25 California, 25 Iowa, 20-25 Missouri, 60 Ohio, 25 Vermont, 50 Colorado, 30 Kansas, 30 Montana, 25 Oklahoma, 65 Virginia, 25 Connecticut, 55 Kentucky, 35 Nebraska, 25 Oregon, 20-25 Washington, 25 Delaware, 25 Louisiana, 55 Nevada, 75 Pennsylvania, 35 West Virginia, 25 Florida, 30 Maine, 25 New Hampshire, 30-35 Rhode Island, 25 Wisconsin, 25 Georgia, 30 Maryland, 30 New Jersey, 25-35 South Carolina, 30 Wyoming, 30 What are nighttime speed limits? There are nighttime speed limits in Montana, which requires drivers to slow from 70 mph to 65 mph on limited access and other roads at night. Some other states have nighttime speed limits during certain seasons. Colorado and Florida change the speed limits when drivers are at peak risk of hitting wildlife. Washington also drops the speed on Highway 20 at night due to a high number of deer on the road.

            "This comprehensive guide covers the definition of flatbed hauling, its benefits, shipping tips, and other crucial things you need to know about hauling cargo using a flatbed. Let s start with what a flatbed truck is and its types and uses. What is a flatbed truck? Flatbed trucks are large vehicles with flat bodies. They don t have roofs or sides. The vehicle s unique bed design is ideal for loads that are too wide for trucks with enclosed bodies. Because forklifts can be maneuvered from any side of the vehicle, a flatbed s design structure simplifies the loading and unloading of cargo. Are there different types of flatbed trailers? If you want to become an owner-operator or start a trucking company with a fleet of trucks, knowing the different types of flatbed trailers and their uses is essential. Here are flatbed trailer types that could be part of your fleet. 1. Step deck A step deck, or drop deck, is a flatbed trailer with a top and bottom deck. The step deck is commonly used for cargo that is too wide or tall to fit into a standard flatbed. Step deck loads usually ride lower in the trailer. Being lower allows the vehicle to pass under low bridges, even with tall loads. At ground level, you can use loading ramps to get on and off the bed easily. 2. Extendable flatbeds Extendable flatbeds, or flatbed stretch trailers, transport cargo that is too long to fit onto a standard flatbed. An extendable flatbed truck can haul freight without overhang. However, larger loads may require a permit and escort vehicles at times. 3. Stretch single-drop deck This trailer type is similar to extendable flatbeds. But it comes with a drop deck. The vehicle can lengthen its bed like an extendable flatbed. It can stretch to accommodate cargo that is too long for standard step decks. Essentially, a stretch single-drop deck can legally carry loads that standard drop-deck flatbeds can t. To secure large cargo, you can attach a bulkhead to the trailer s front. This can protect the freight from coming loose during hard-braking events. Attaching a bulkhead should also allow the cargo to bend and go over the truck s cab. Instead of into it. 4. Double drop Double-drop flatbeds allow you to load oversize freight, including items more than 10 feet tall. Besides a front and back deck, double-drop flatbeds have a well in the middle. The well is usually 25 to 29 feet long to accommodate tall freight. But the well can shorten your space for loading cargo. It requires a crane and other flatbed trucking tools to load and unload. 5. Removable gooseneck trailer RGN RGNs are versatile trailers you can use for long and tall loads, such as large machinery. RGNs are detachable. The trailer can be dropped to the ground to become a ramp. That means you can drive heavy equipment right onto the deck. RGNs are usually designed with three to 20 axles. Axles allow them to carry and deliver heavy and massive payloads. 6. Side-kit Side-kit flatbed trailers include panels, curved metal spines shaped like bows, and stakes around the bed s perimeter. Together they provide a structure that allows you to attach tarps if needed. When tarps are attached, the side-kit flatbed s design can protect sensitive cargo from exposure to the elements. 7. Lowboys A lowboy trailer can handle cargo that is too tall for step deck flatbeds. Lowboys resemble step decks. These vehicle types include a double drop. They sit lower than standard drop deck trailers. Lowboy trailers sit 18 inches off the ground. Their height allows them to accommodate freight that requires clearance heights of up to 11 feet and 6 inches. Flatbed hauling Legal dimensions you need to know The points below cover commercial flatbed trailer types and their corresponding dimensions and weight capacity. Standard flatbed trailer dimensions The general rule requires that the total weight of the truck, cargo, and trailer not exceed 80,000 pounds. For standard flatbeds, the maximum freight dimensions are outlined below. Length 48 feet to 53 feet Height 8.5 feet Width 8.5 feet The maximum freight weight must be 48,000 to 52,000 pounds. Step deck The step deck s legal weight and dimensions are described below. Maximum freight weight 48,000 pounds Top deck length 11 feet Bottom deck length 37 feet Width 8 feet 6 inches Bottom deck height 10 feet Extendable flatbeds The maximum legal weight and dimensions for extendable flatbeds are outlined below. Maximum freight weight 43,000 pounds Minimum length 48 feet Maximum length 80 feet Height 8 feet 6 inches Width 8 feet 6 inches Double drop The legal weight and dimensions for double-drop flatbeds are outlined below. Maximum freight weight 36,000 to 42,000 pounds Main deck Length 25 feet to 29 feet Width 8 feet 6 inches Height 11 feet 6 inches Front deck Length 10 feet Width 8 feet 6 inches Height 8 feet 6 inches Rear deck Length 9 feet Width 8 feet 6 inches Height 10 feet Side-kit The legal flatbed dimensions and weight limits for side kits are outlined below. Maximum freight weight 45,000 pounds Length 48 or 53 feet Width 8 feet 4 inches Height 8 feet 6 inches What are oversized flatbed dimensions? Flatbed dimensions exceeding 8.5 feet wide are considered oversized. Shipments that exceed 12 feet in width might require one or two pilot vehicles of the flatbed vehicle. Also, weight restrictions are applied on a per-axle basis. That means shipments can t exceed the total weight limit but might exceed the per axle value. In such cases, adjusting the load can make your shipment legal, eliminating the need for special requirements and permits. How to ensure flatbed loads are safe for hauling Safety protocols, standard processes, and trucking essentials are critical to keeping flatbed loads safe. Follow the tips below to ensure a secure flatbed load and safe flatbed driving. 1. Use the right tie-down equipment and plan the cargo placement After loading and distributing the cargo load safely and evenly, determine the number of tie-downs required and where each should go. According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA cargo securement rules , you ll need at least one tie-down for every 10 feet of cargo, and any fraction beyond that. For example, a 35-foot long flatbed freight would require four tie-downs. You should also factor in the total working load limit of the securement devices, chains, and tie-down straps. The load limit should be 50 of the total cargo weight. You can check the limits on the manufacturer manuals or its visible tags. Keep these quick tips in mind when selecting securement devices. Ensure the chains, chain binders, and ratchet straps can keep your freight fastened tightly in place when the rig is moving Opt for cargo straps made of softer materials, such as plastic piping and lumber, to avoid potential damage Invest in corner and edge protectors to extend the lifespan of your tie-down straps Conduct fleet safety training and coaching for your drivers and staff to make sure everyone knows the proper equipment and ways to set them up It s always good practice for drivers to do quick inspections every 50 miles. The inspections ensure that cargo hasn t shifted and that tie-downs are still holding. 2. Double-check your specs and distribute the cargo evenly nbsp Avoid exceeding your flatbed trailer s standard maximum freight weight. Distribute the cargo evenly to prevent the flatbed trailer from tipping or swerving. Follow these general best practices. Calculate the freight weight to distribute it properly and secure the cargo Start stacking the load in the middle and move outward Place heavier items above the axles and lower to the deck to keep a low center of gravity Position 60 of the load in the flatbed trailer s front half to keep the back end lighter and less unwieldy during transit 3. Take proper precautions Flatbed trucking drivers must exercise caution when loading, securing, unloading, and transporting cargo. To avoid accidents and life-threatening injuries, drivers should also be careful when working on or around trailers. Follow these safety tips. Provide appropriate gear, such as ankle supports and non-slip footwear Make sure everyone is mindful of obstructed walkways and narrow ledges that could cause anyone to fall or lose their footing Ensure your personnel follows standard procedure when loading, securing, moving, and unloading flatbed cargo No one should jump from the trailer, and anyone going down must use the steps and climb down carefully Use a fleet safety solution that allows you to track dangerous flatbed trucking driving behavior Benefits of flatbed shipping for freight companies Flatbed shipping can be one of the most effective and secure ways to transport and handle cargo. Below are four benefits of flatbed shipping. 1. Flexibility A flatbed truck s design allows cranes and forklifts to load goods from all angles. This makes loading, transporting, and unloading heavy and massive cargo easier. It s especially useful for hauling heavy machinery and equipment for the construction industry. 2. Allows you to optimize trips Flatbed trucks can transport high volumes of materials in one trip, saving you time and money. Flatbed hauling also lets you transport oddly shaped cargo easily. That means you don t need to break the item into parts to move it. 3. No loading dock restrictions There are no loading dock restrictions for flatbed hauling , helping to expand your service coverage. Flatbed trucks can deliver goods to any location, including residential neighborhoods and large construction sites. 4. Secure cargo Since the freight is exposed, flatbed trucks have specific standards to secure cargo. That means you ll need to take more precautions. To keep the cargo from shifting during transport, you ll also have to use heavy-duty equipment, such as chains, tarps, and coil racks. Flatbed shipping helps keep cargo safer and more secure. It ensures that everything arrives at the destination unscathed. Flatbed shipping tips Follow the tips below for proper and efficient flatbed shipping. Understand the freight details. Know the type of cargo you re hauling to determine the right materials to secure the flatbed freight during shipment. Also know the cargo s value, dimensions and weight.

            "The Best Fleets to Drive For list has been released every year by Carriers E dge since 2008. Back when social media was new and drivers were logging hours of service in paper logs. A lot has changed since then. And CarriersEdge, a company that focuses on driver training, has spent years helping drivers make the best decisions along the way. The Best Fleets to Drive For list entails a rigorous vetting process that includes an extensive questionnaire, a 100-question driver survey, and an interview with fleet leaders. This year, 150 companies were nominated by their drivers as the Best Fleets to Drive For. Those nominations were whittled down to 20 who have met the CarriersEdge standards of excellence. What does it take to be counted among the Best Fleets to Drive For? We interviewed CarriersEdge co-founders Jane Jazrawy and Mark Murrell to find out. Here are 10 best practices that the best fleets follow. 1. They care about empathy This year required commercial transportation companies to think less about key performance indicators and more about the human factors that drive the business. ldquo One theme that emerged during the questionnaire and interview process was not what message is communicated, but how that message is communicated, rdquo Murrell says. ldquo Multiple companies acknowledged that the frequency of communications is not nearly as important as the sentiment of the message. rdquo One fleet, for example, added an app to its phone system, scoring each phone conversation based on relative positivity. Another did the same with its mobile communications. How effective these techniques are remains to be seen. Still, as fleets realize satisfied drivers stick around, they re considering their feelings a lot more. 2. They host podcasts Just as the best fleets are using technology in more innovative ways, they rsquo re becoming more thoughtful about their content marketing. ldquo Podcasts are an efficient, personal way for fleets to stay in touch with the team, rdquo Jazrawy says. ldquo As fleets seek creative ways to engage drivers from a distance and keep the line of communication open, podcasts are becoming an important trend with lots of staying power. rdquo Recent data from ldquo The Infinite Dial Report rdquo reinforces Jazrawy rsquo s stance. Forty-one percent of Americans surveyed said they had listened to a podcast in the last month, up from 37 a year ago. ldquo This growth goes to show that commercial fleets would be wise to use podcasts to get their message out and establish a dialog with employees, rdquo Jazrawy says. 3. They rsquo re proactive on safety The best fleets don rsquo t react to problems. They stay ahead of them. Where reactive companies begin damage control after an accident has occurred, proactive fleets take steps to prevent accidents from happening at all. Long before others caught on, the best fleets used data-driven technologies to become safer and more efficient. As dash cams began to produce safer outcomes on the road, the best carriers continued to advocate for next-level safety innovations like the Motive AI Dashcam . Through artificial intelligence and computer vision, the AI Dashcam reveals a driver rsquo s level of awareness whenever an unsafe driving incident occurs. Did the driver remove their eyes from the road? Were they reaching for something in the cab? The AI Dashcam captures these high-risk driving habits on video, alerting drivers to them as they happen. Motive rsquo s event intelligence and in-house safety team analyzes every video within seconds of an unsafe event to determine its context and severity. Managers get prioritized videos with rich, actionable insights, and drivers receive automated coaching tips right through the Motive Driver App. Automated coaching helps to modify unsafe behavior before it leads to a collision. 4. They rsquo re proactive on communication too Fleets that work to prevent accidents on the road also work to prevent small problems from becoming big problems . ldquo Where reactive fleets wait for drivers to come knocking on a supervisor rsquo s door, proactive fleets empower mid-level managers to address drivers rsquo concerns as they arise, rdquo Murrell says. ldquo Having that extra layer of communication between drivers and higher-ups ensures that concerns will be addressed in a timely manner. rdquo Murrell says that although the term ldquo open-door policy rdquo may sound like it rsquo s part of a proactive culture, it rsquo s actually an example of a reactive approach. ldquo Every fleet says they have an open-door policy, but I don rsquo t think that rsquo s necessarily true, rdquo he says. ldquo Saying lsquo The door is always open rsquo is different from going out and saying, lsquo What do you think is good and bad about this company and what should we be changing? rsquo rdquo 5. They support struggling employees While some carriers prepared drivers for the pandemic by doling out hand sanitizer and reminding them to clean their trucks, the top 20 fleets did more. ldquo Several drivers were having mental health issues during the shutdown, rdquo Jazrawy says. ldquo When fleets took the time to make sure drivers were OK, it proved to be really important. We saw a big difference among the fleets that gave out supplies only, and those who followed up with drivers and asked how they were feeling. rdquo ldquo Drivers stay at a company long term when they feel part of a family, rdquo Murrell adds. ldquo The fleets that found a way to make frontline workers feel connected during the shutdown were able to create a family vibe under very difficult circumstances. rdquo 6. They use driver scorecards to improve performance In the past, innovation centered on technology itself. This year, innovation came from how fleets are using technology, such as ELDs and dash cams. ldquo Technological solutions have become intertwined with best practices , rdquo Murrell explains. ldquo Fleets are incorporating driver scorecards into their safety programs to help drivers become safer individually and collectively. rdquo A driver scorecard provides a way of evaluating driver performance that is based on specific driving metrics. These might include speeding, hard braking, or close following. Operations and safety managers can use driver scorecards to track high-risk behaviors and determine which drivers need coaching. Many companies categorize goals based on productivity, safety, or compliance. Similar to driver scorecards, Motive rsquo s coaching workspace can be used to evaluate performance and identify driving trends. Located in the Safety Hub on the Motive Fleet Dashboard, the coaching workspace automatically generates a list of coachable drivers and their high-risk behaviors. This helps fleet managers better understand which drivers need attention and which behaviors to coach them on. 7. They rsquo re diverse, equitable, and inclusive Companies don rsquo t build diversity, equity, and inclusion DEI overnight. Fleets with the most impressive DEI track record invested in their initiatives over several years. American Central Transport, for example, has run a campaign called ldquo I am ACT rdquo aimed at attracting a diverse population of drivers. In the campaign, the company features videos of drivers of various ethnicities telling their stories in their own words. ldquo ACT presents a valuable lesson in how commercial fleets can use their own drivers to highlight diversity and inclusion within the company, rdquo Jazrawy says. ldquo When people see diversity and inclusion in a company rsquo s corporate messaging and social posts, it will attract even more diverse workers to their ranks. rdquo When leadership is diverse, employees will be too. And not just racially diverse. In the commercial transportation industry, there rsquo s been a surge in LGBTQ drivers. ldquo More and more, we rsquo re hearing about trans drivers specifically, rdquo Jazrawy says. ldquo Fleets are always talking about the difficulty of attracting Millennials and Generation Z. Did you know that one in six Gen Z adults are part of the LGBTQ spectrum? And that 50 of them don rsquo t think that gender is binary? Gen Z is very happy being on the spectrum. That will be the next big thing in the transportation industry, and fleets would do well to think of that. rdquo 8. They use Facebook Live for real-time communication Many carriers use Facebook for recruiting. But only the best of them use Facebook Live to have a conversation with drivers in real time. When transportation companies use the platform to livestream meetings, it gives employees the chance to ask questions as the meeting unfolds. Even drivers who miss the live event can view the video later and leave questions or comments in the company rsquo s Facebook feed. ldquo Not everyone is using Facebook to communicate with their teams, but they should be, rdquo Jazrawy says. ldquo With the conversations that take place through the live platform, fleets can gain insight into which issues drivers are concerned about and how satisfied they are. rdquo 9. They use their own branded mobile apps Today s mobile app landscape is focused on efficiency. And smartphones continue to serve as the central command center for drivers on the road. ldquo The difference is that fleets now brand their own mobile apps, rdquo Murrell says. ldquo They rsquo ve created apps that integrate with driver scorecards or allow drivers to check payroll information, scan documents, and plan loads, all right from their fingertips. rdquo The Motive Driver App, for example, has a Documents Feature that lets fleets manage, customize, and share documents with drivers. All from one integrated platform. Managers can upload documents to the Fleet Dashboard, customize forms, or use pre-built templates using a simple drag-and-drop interface. They can also share documents directly with drivers. Drivers, meanwhile, can use the Documents Feature to upload multiple photos per document, capture electronic signatures on mobile, and share documents with fleet managers. 10. They use safety technology to reward positive behavior Some of the best fleets use dash cam clips to recognize drivers for a job well done, and it sets them apart. ldquo The tendency of transportation companies to use dash cams to reward safe driving instead of only tracking unsafe behaviors struck us as a highly positive development, rdquo Jazrawy says. ldquo We expect more carriers to start implementing this practice in the future. rdquo The Motive AI Dashcam can be utilized to share and showcase exceptional acts of safety among drivers. Capable of capturing 104 hours of continuously recorded video, the dash cam, along with the Motive Safety Score, can provide visibility into your best drivers and those who need additional coaching. With the added perspective that the Safety Score provides, safety managers can ensure that top drivers are rewarded for their good work and that others will be recognized for improvement.\n",

            "It rsquo s almost unimaginable today that someone in North America wouldn rsquo t have experience with a global positioning system GPS . Most of us have GPS devices on our phones, and many of us have GPS trackers in our cars. Commercial fleets can also use GPS tracking to improve productivity and track assets. Yet how many of us actually understand how GPS works? This blog answers that question and shares the many applications and advantages of GPS fleet tracking systems . What is GPS tracking? In simple terms, GPS is a technology that tracks the location of an object. While GPS tracking is a relatively new technology, the process it uses to track objects has been around for well over one hundred years. Triangulation is at the heart of what GPS does. Before satellites, triangulation measured distances. With the invention of radios, we used the same technique of measuring the strength of a signal and direction to triangulate where a signal originated. Satellite navigation relies on radio signals transmitted from medium-earth orbit. GPS satellites emit signals used by GPS tracking devices to accurately determine location and time. It may sound complicated, and a little rocket science is involved, but what GPS tracking means for your company is that you can know where a vehicle is, how fast it rsquo s traveling, and the estimated time of arrival. Read What is GPS fleet tracking technology? What is the history of GPS? The system was originally developed by the military in the 1960s. The United States Navy began using satellite navigation to track submarines carrying nuclear missiles. By sending and observing signals to six satellites in space orbiting the poles, the Navy could find submarine locations within minutes. The Department of Defense DoD got on board with the idea in the 1970s and launched the first Navigation System with Timing and Ranging NAVSTAR in 1978. By 1993 it was a fully operational 24-satellite system for multi-use navigation. Today, there are 31 GPS satellites operated by the U.S. as part of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems , which serve the international community. How does GPS tracking work? A GPS tracking device, fitted with a receiver, is attached to the object you want to monitor. The device is also built to record the time and its location using latitude and longitude in relation to the GPS satellites. Finding one object rsquo s location takes multiple satellites. While hurtling hundreds of miles per hour in space, the satellites bounce a signal back and the time it takes for it to return allows the transmitter to calculate the distance from each satellite. The receiver uses the difference between the signal broadcast and reception time to compute distance. The more satellites that send back a signal, the more data there is with which to make a precise measurement. Accounting for delay and signal speed changes caused by the fact that it rsquo s traveling through the earth rsquo s atmosphere, the GPS uses information about the device rsquo s range from three satellites, and the location of the satellite when the signal was sent, to plot a three-dimensional position. Then, at regular intervals, the receiver relays that location data to the GPS tracking software. Data relay may be done in near real time if the device has its own data transmitter or can be downloaded manually from the device. The GPS tracking software takes that recorded data and translates the logged information into a location on a map. The Motive Asset Gateway Solar captures data every minute and reports it to the user rsquo s dashboard while cable powered. What are the uses of GPS? Designed and maintained by the U.S. government, GPS tracking is today operated by the United States Air Force to meet national defense and homeland security needs. Still, it has many commercial applications too. 1. Vehicle tracking This can apply to passenger or commercial vehicles. For example, most new car models today come factory-fitted with GPS to enable private car owners to use satellite navigation. This has increased driver satisfaction with their vehicles while also helping to reduce fuel expenses as individuals are able to take more efficient routes to their destinations. 2. Fleet tracking In addition to tracking a single vehicle, fleet tracking uses GPS to monitor and dispatch many vehicles, assets, and trailers. The applications include Taxi services Commercial fleets Freight trucks Waste management Public transportation Emergency vehicles Roadside assistance Trailer tracking School busses 3. Heavy machinery Mining and construction businesses, for instance, use GPS to make it easy for drivers to follow pre-programmed site plans and achieve close tolerance for position, gradient, and level. With in-cabin vehicle guidance and control systems, it rsquo s also easier to avoid the delays that can slow down a site and cause unforeseen expenses. GPS tracking also provides an overall map view of all the moving parts on a mining or construction site. This makes it much easier for site managers to monitor fuel use, inventory availability, and employee productivity. Further, they have the data they need to manage payroll, validate invoices, and do root cause analysis if problems arise. Preventative maintenance is also simplified as the technology makes it easier to track wear-and-tear on assets and anticipate when frequently used equipment needs some TLC. 4. Agricultural use Farmers now put GPS receivers on tractors and other farming equipment for better fleet asset management throughout the planting, weeding, and harvesting seasons. GPS tracking enables precision farming with farmers able to do more accurate farm planning, field mapping, soil sampling, crop scouting, and yield mapping. GPS-based tractor guidance also helps farmers work in more difficult conditions rain, dust, fog, and darkness while the navigation tools enable maximum ground coverage in the shortest possible time. With more precise application of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, farmers can also reduce expenses and see a higher crop yield while being more environmentally friendly. 5. Route planning GPS is all about accurate and timely information, which is just what you need to do the best route planning. GPS tracking systems not only provide real-time awareness of asset positioning, but also help you determine how to get from one location to another and determine the expected timing. GPS planning makes it easier to find the best approach to a multi-stop route. Plus, the driver is aided by turn-by-turn directions that can take into consideration changes along the way from weather, traffic, or other constraints. 6. Vehicle or asset recovery Many GPS tracking systems today allow you to find a vehicle or asset if it is stolen. Even when the stolen vehicle or asset is in motion, you can track the whereabouts to facilitate recovery. Many GPS tracking software also allow you to set up a geofence perimeter to help prevent theft. Operators can be alerted if an asset leaves a pre-established perimeter. How accurate is GPS? That depends. The satellites are equipped with highly accurate atomic clocks and the U.S. government is committed to broadcasting the GPS signal in space for an accuracy range of less than or equal to 2 meters 6.6 feet , with 95 probability. Yet, the signal does depend on other factors including satellite geometry, signal blockage, atmospheric conditions, and receiver design features quality. GPS-enabled smartphones, for example, are typically accurate within a 4.9 meter 16 feet radius under an open sky, but GPS accuracy suffers near buildings, bridges, and trees. Trying to receive the signal indoors or underground can also degrade GPS accuracy. And, in case you rsquo re wondering, the U.S. government lets civilian and commercial users have the same level of accuracy in GPS signaling as the military uses. That wasn rsquo t always the case, but in May 2000 the Clinton administration directed the government to do away with Selective Availability. Do you need GPS tracking? Any organization that operates commercial vehicles may benefit from GPS tracking. Taking the satellite signal for navigation and coupling it with software that integrates real-time insights into location, speed, and other data suits several scenarios. When considering a top-rated GPS tracking system ask yourself if you want to Protect valuable assets in the case of theft Reduce fuel and maintenance costs Improve route efficiency Provide driver training opportunities Reduce insurance costs Improve customer satisfaction Find operational efficiencies Learn more about GPS Fleet Tracking solutions from Motive What are the benefits of GPS tracking? A GPS system is a must-have for companies of any size with vehicles on the road. The most advanced GPS systems collect location points every 30 seconds and are also based on changes in speed and bearing. This offers many important benefits. 1. Gain GPS location and alerts A GPS system is most useful if it automatically sends an alert when certain conditions are met, such as when a vehicle leaves or enters a boundary. Plus, with a high-end GPS system, drivers can easily transmit location information without having to make a phone call. This lets you track your fleet accurately, while improving driver satisfaction and increasing overall efficiency . 2. Route efficiently The shortest route between two points doesn rsquo t always mean the fastest. Using the history of travel routes collectively, a GPS tracker can calculate the fastest route based on the time of day and traffic congestion or road construction. 3. Reduce detention times Find out which pick-up and drop-off queues are taking longer than they should so you can reduce idle time. After all, idle time can cost up to 1,200 per driver per year. Decreasing detention can also increase safety. Addressing idling also has fleet benefits. Detention can increase engine wear, resulting in more maintenance. Detention also increases the carbon emissions of your business and increases fuel and labor costs. 4. Tighten your delivery window Food or other perishable deliveries live or die on fast delivery times. With real-time GPS asset tracking , you rsquo ll be able to provide a tighter delivery window for your customers. You can also notify clients when the unexpected collision has your delivery locked up in traffic. 5. Improve customer service Clients love a heads-up when expecting a delivery. The best GPS software allows you to notify them automatically and improve customer service . With real-time visibility, customers have the most accurate ETAs so they can prep their worksite, warehouse, or receiving dock for your vehicle rsquo s arrival. 6. Enjoy data insights Complete visibility into your fleet via GPS tracking software can help you identify the causes of increased fuel consumption. Does one vehicle in the fleet refuel more often than the others just like it? It might be due for maintenance. Is one driver more prone to jackrabbit starts or harsh braking or worse, taking personal errands or side jobs ? You can address that with more training or coaching. 7. Reduce paperwork Throw out the old mileage logbook. Yes, the one with the coffee stains all over your driver rsquo s chicken scratch handwriting. With an intuitive app in the GPS tracking software, your drivers can perform daily tasks up to 50 faster and keep up with communications back to the office seamlessly. This also does away with waiting days or weeks to receive pertinent data from drivers out on the road. 8. Integrate with your ELD If your drivers are subject to electronic logging device ELD regulations, a good GPS system will integrate with the ELD and work hand in hand with that system to help the driver stay compliant. An ELD integration can Notify drivers of required upcoming breaks and alert them of HOS violations approaching Automate IFTA fuel tax reporting to eliminate the administrative burden of collecting state mileage and fuel receipts Reduce human error and audit risk with complex calculations handled by the software 9. Support driver safety Integrating the latest tools for implementing and monitoring driving behavior, you can improve driver safety too. The top GPS tracking solutions analyze, contextualize, and prioritize events to save time for safety departments, help you benchmark performance, and track impact of driver coaching . 10. Geofencing Setting up a geofence perimeter on the GPS tracking tool helps you know when your vehicles enter or leave a predetermined area. This can reduce administrative burden, increase efficiency, simplify time and payroll management, improve compliance and fleet safety, and boost customer satisfaction. Geofencing also works as an excellent anti-theft deterrent and increases fleet security with alerts for when vehicles go beyond approved routes and virtual boundaries. Learn more about how geofencing can help improve productivity . 11. Smarter maintenance scheduling Integrating GPS telematics data into a fleet maintenance platform allows you to make data-driven maintenance decisions. Instead of relying on time-based or mileage-based maintenance schedules, fleet managers can use the tracking software rsquo s odometer readings to prompt service reminders and alerts to ensure you stay on top of each asset rsquo s preventative maintenance. Track your fleet accurately with Motive GPS is a pretty amazing tool. This system increases your ability to keep your assets safe, and can also give you insight into driver behavior, ushering in training opportunities that can help you develop a strong, long-term employee. Your business doesn rsquo t have to be a large fleet to benefit from a high-quality GPS system . Even one commercial vehicle in your fleet is important enough to protect with a GPS tracking system. A GPS tracking system is so much more than a map. With it, you can lower costs while raising your level of customer service. GPS tracking can help protect your drivers and cargo too.

            "Most industries can benefit from GPS tracking, but the positive results and return on investment are quickly apparent in construction. Using GPS tracking technology, construction companies can run more efficiently and improve profitability with the ability to track and locate assets in real time. This article explains how GPS construction equipment is used and further explores the advantages of GPS fleet tracking for this industry. How is GPS tracking used for construction equipment? GPS tracking software relies on the Global Positioning System developed by the military to track and determine the location of assets. Today, any company can use GPS tracking devices that send a signal to satellites which then bounce a signal back to help the transmitter calculate location. Top-rated construction GPS equipment is installed in or on heavy-duty vehicles and other equipment to track and transmit the asset rsquo s whereabouts. This offers many benefits, which we rsquo ll discuss in more detail next. Track and monitor your equipment with Motive. Why use GPS in the construction industry? Using GPS technology in construction has numerous advantages, including theft deterrence, time savings, and safety. Read What is GPS fleet tracking technology? Locate missing or stolen equipment Nearly 1,000 pieces of construction equipment are reported stolen each month to the National Crime Information Center NCIC . Thieves target backhoes, loaders, bulldozers, forklifts, generators, and other valuable assets because of their high resale value. This theft is costly. Not only does the company face the hard cost of replacing the stolen equipment, but insurance costs can go up too. In addition, theft can cause project-stopping delays, which could mean missed deadlines and even the loss of a customer. Heavy equipment tracking can help superintendents monitor assets in real time . And a GPS tracker may discourage bad behavior. Warning signs alerting would-be thieves that the equipment is equipped with GPS tracking devices may be a great deterrent. Tracking devices may also help recover stolen equipment. Streamline workflow and asset allocation Downtime costs money. In the days of paper-based records, an asset inevitably sat idle in between assignments. Even if we rsquo re only talking about an hour, multiply that amount of time by the number of pieces of equipment your business owns. Then add the number of jobs you take on over the course of a year, and you rsquo ll start seeing potentially large financial losses. Equipment also experiences costly downtime when sent to the wrong job or to a job where it isn rsquo t needed. Whether an asset is simply waiting for its turn to be sent on a job, or your staff is losing valuable time looking for it, when it rsquo s not on the job, it rsquo s not making you money. Construction GPS tracking allows your fleet to know an asset is becoming available before it happens, so you can make the best use of it with the shortest amount of transition time. At the same time, since you can track all of your assets in real time, you always have a complete picture of what your needs are on every job site. Prevent misuse of vehicles and equipment Sometimes employees use work trucks or other company vehicles for personal reasons. Personal use of company equipment increases your liability and can result in increased insurance premiums if an incident should occur. If personal use is against company policy, GPS tracking for construction equipment will tell you where and when unauthorized use occurs. Improve safety GPS tracking devices can play a large role in helping companies monitor the driving habits of their workers. Devices can provide reports and notifications chronicling the speed at which the vehicle is moving. This includes whether it has accelerated beyond the posted limit. It also includes if the vehicle has been subjected to aggressive driving like hard turns or stops. These can be indicators of close calls. A good overall fleet management solution can tell you when to coach your drivers and help them improve their skills. Our AI-powered safety platform combines real-time in-cab alerting, automated post-trip coaching, and predictive insights from the Safety Score to help reduce accidents by up to 30 . Safety depends just as much on vehicle health as on driver skill. Overusing assets and falling behind on regular maintenance are two risk factors for maintenance issues. Equipment can break down after sustained use, especially if the contractor has a full schedule and backlog of projects. If breakdowns occur and repairs can rsquo t be made on site, new equipment is brought in as a replacement. Streamline your construction fleet management strategy While it may not happen often, there are instances when crews aren rsquo t on the job site when they should be. GPS tracking can give you a real-time map of your vehicles, drivers, and all of the assets related to that specific job. This lets you know exactly where they are at any given time. GPS tracking can also assist you in tracking the hours worked for your crew, which helps when billing customers. You can use the GPS to track your crew rsquo s labor hours based on their arrival time on site. With real-time data insights into assets, operational efficiency improves. This can help the construction company sidestep delays, reduce costs, and avoid unforeseen expenses. Cutting downtime and increasing accountability may help the company improve client relationships too. The case for GPS construction tracking nbsp Cordy Environmental Inc. used the Motive Vehicle Gateway to exonerate its driver when there was an issue onsite. The customer thought Cordy rsquo s driver dumped drilling mud somewhere it wasn rsquo t meant to be. Allen Chatten, the company rsquo s HSE Advisor, was able to open up GPS location history and prove it wasn rsquo t their drivers. ldquo We were able to exonerate ourselves because we proved that we had never even been there in the last two weeks, rdquo Chatten said. ldquo That was a big help for us because we kept our good standing with our customers. rdquo Why use Motive rsquo s GPS construction tracking? Motive rsquo s real-time fleet tracking software for the construction industry takes the guesswork out of knowing where your drivers, vehicles, equipment, and trailers are at any time while protecting your valuable assets. Superintendents can even set up geofencing alerts to simplify dispatch or know immediately if heavy equipment is being taken outside of the allowed boundaries.

            "If you rsquo re a truck driver or manage a fleet of trucks, then you need to understand the importance of finding the right truck route when making deliveries and drop-offs. Find out more about truck route planning and how your business can benefit from it . What is route planning? Route planning involves finding the most optimal routes by assessing maps and finding the quickest way to get from point A to point B. The aim is to know exactly which way you rsquo re traveling before you start your engine and which way you rsquo ll get there with the hope of spending less time on the road. In professional cases, route planning also involves assessing which roads might be obstructed due to traffic congestion or roadworks. However, planning a truck route requires more in-depth and complex planning with a robust set of tools. Also often referred to as commercial driving, truck routing is a dynamic industry that runs across the country on a grand scale every day, so it needs seamless operational management. Why is route planning important for truck drivers and fleets? Route planning is beneficial for every driver but is especially important for commercial fleets. Ultimately, route planning cuts down transportation, fuel, and vehicle maintenance costs. It also helps increase revenue by increasing efficiency and productivity. As you rsquo d expect, the main benefit of route planning is improved time management and efficiency. Drivers spend less time on the road thanks to finding the most convenient routes, meaning you can improve the efficiency of your fleet and better manage the well-being of your drivers. Route planners are especially beneficial to fleet managers, as they allow you to meet your customers rsquo needs more efficiently and within the agreed-upon timelines. This ultimately leads to less time spent on support calls and an improvement in your customer retention rates. Of course, route planners cut down on time spent manually assessing and inputting routes. For example, if you manage a fleet of trucks, a robust truck route software will use advanced tools and data points to analyze every aspect of the road, from the length, speed limits, traffic, and more. The software means fleet managers no longer need to spend hours assessing maps themselves, where there rsquo s also a risk of human error. Truck route planning also saves you money over time. You won rsquo t need to spend as much on the admin time it would usually take to plan routes manually. You rsquo ll save money on fuel by planning your routes to help drivers avoid congested areas, so they won rsquo t spend as much time sitting in traffic. You rsquo ll also spend less on general vehicle maintenance, as vehicles will maintain their condition for longer by spending less time on the road. Is commercial route planning different from consumer route planning? Yes. Consumer route planning means getting from one destination to the next by following the simplest and fastest route. Consumer route planning and commercial route planning may share a common goal of getting a driver to a destination, but the economic importance dramatically differs. When conducting commercial route planning, you must also consider timescales, vehicle sizes, vehicle capacity, driver capacity, roadworks, conditions of the road, and, in the case of truck drivers, each road rsquo s height and width constraints. Truck drivers won rsquo t stop by any regular gas station for a break like a consumer driver would. Instead, they have scheduled breaks at designated stops where they must spend a specific amount of time to take a break. The average driver doesn rsquo t have to adhere to these mandatory breaks. And basic software like Google Maps, which only allows 10 stops per journey, doesn rsquo t have the capacity to plan a route like the software required for truck route planning. Top tips for truck route planning as a fleet manager As a fleet manager , you want to find ways to manage and monitor your vehicles and drivers that are seamless and leave little scope for error. That rsquo s why the best tip for route planning as a fleet manager is to introduce robust truck route planning software. Fleet managers should never use routing platforms like Google Maps and Waze for truck route planning. These types of route planners are designed for the average consumer driver to find directions easily. Google Maps can only schedule 10 stops and Waze is only built for one stop per journey. This isn rsquo t ideal for fleet managers, as you rsquo ll more than likely need to plan multi-stop long-haul routes to meet your business needs. The fleet manager will have to manually input a limited number of stops, and the route won rsquo t necessarily show where there rsquo s heavy traffic or other problems on the road like adverse weather. Not only that, these route planners are only built for cars and smaller vehicles, meaning they don rsquo t support truck routes. You won rsquo t be able to assess the widths of roads or low bridges and bypasses, which could cause truck drivers along the way. With all this in mind, the best tip for fleet managers is to find a versatile truck route software that considers every important aspect of truck route planning and more. This would usually include real-time fleet asset tracking to get live updates on where your trucks are, how fast they are traveling, and whether there are any upcoming obstructions. The software will also assess which roads are safe for trucks to travel down, directing drivers that way instead of going down roads built for cars and smaller vehicles. Fleet managers are also responsible for ensuring their drivers take the required breaks as declared by the FMCSA . The rules for break times are Drivers must have at least one 30-minute break when driving for more than eight hours. Drivers must not drive for more than 11 hours during a 14-hour time window. Drivers must not drive more than 60 hours within a seven-day time window. Truck route planning can be streamlined to include these break schedules. The planner will monitor how long a driver has been on the road and let them know where they can safely take their allocated break. Top tips for route planning as a truck driver Truck drivers rarely need to make the big decisions, as their fleet managers decide most things for them by using truck route software. However, as the driver, you still have a set of responsibilities. All truck drivers should make sure they are prepared with the journey ahead before turning on the engine. If your fleet uses the appropriate truck route software, then your direction, stops, and break times will already be planned. Make sure you spend some time checking your assigned scheduled route, so you get a good feel of what rsquo s to come. It helps to look ahead and find out where all the essential stop-off points are. These include repair shops and service stations that have restrooms. You should also check where you rsquo ll be able to buy food along the way, but we rsquo d also recommend taking non-perishable items if you can rsquo t pick up other food. We rsquo d also recommend taking extra supplies like spare clothes and a first aid box. Even if you rsquo re not scheduled to stop-off somewhere overnight to spread out a long-haul journey, it helps to be prepared should you break down or get stuck somewhere unexpected. One of the best tips for truck route planning is to monitor the changing weather conditions. Download and refer to a variety of weather apps so you can get a good idea of what types of weather you might be driving through. If it looks as though there will be high winds, heavy rain, snow, ice, or even flooding, then you rsquo ll either need to re-route or postpone your journey. Be sure to check the weather for each area you rsquo ll be driving through, including your starting and ending points. It rsquo s vital for truck drivers to be aware of the vehicle condition before starting a journey of any length. Not only does it better ensure the safety of the truck driver, but all other drivers they rsquo ll be sharing the road with along the way. Make sure the vehicle isn rsquo t overdue for its service and that it has enough fuel for you to at least drive it to one of your designated service stations. If you break down due to not having enough fuel or because something is wrong with the vehicle then deliveries will inevitably be delayed. Truck drivers should also maintain appropriate communication with the necessary points of call. This includes your fleet manager so they can assess your progress and those who you rsquo re delivering to so they know when to expect your arrival. Why use Motive as your route planning software?

            "Fuel consumption accounts for up to 60 of operating costs in a company rsquo s total fleet budget. By reducing your fuel consumption, you can improve your bottom line. Companies are using fleet management systems and fleet fuel tax apps to improve fuel efficiency. Fleet management systems help track, optimize, and manage the fleet rsquo s fuel usage. Fleet fuel tax apps are perfect for monitoring fuel purchase data and fuel tax submissions. Continue reading to learn more fuel-saving tips for drivers and fleet owners. How to save fuel as a driver Below are several ways commercial drivers can cut fuel consumption and save on fuel costs . Monitor tire pressure Ensuring your tires aren rsquo t overinflated or underinflated can help you save on fuel costs and other expenses. It rsquo s a good practice to maintain proper tire inflation based on the vehicle manufacturer rsquo s recommendations. It rsquo s also a good idea to perform routine maintenance checks to ensure safety and better fuel economy. Be careful to avoid overinflating tires. Extra air pressure can distort your tire rsquo s shape. It can also lead to lower traction and more wear and tear down the tire rsquo s center. Overinflation can also cause tires to wear out more quickly, adding to repair and maintenance costs. Underinflated tires can increase the vehicle rsquo s drag. By working harder, the vehicle consumes more fuel and increases the likelihood of tread separation and tire blowouts. And that can cause accidents. According to the U.S. Department of Energy , you can improve gas mileage from 0.6 to up to 3 by keeping your vehicle rsquo s tires properly inflated. Drive steadily Avoid fuel-wasting driving practices,. Even methods like varying your speed between 75 and 85 km per hour every 18 seconds can increase your fuel use by 20 . Use cruise control when driving on highways. It rsquo s good to know that slight speed variations can be beneficial when going downhill, and gravity can do most of the work. You can drop your speed during uphill travels, then regain time going downhill. Ensure your vehicle is aerodynamic Ensuring good aerodynamics for your vehicle can reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency, especially at high speeds. Closing your windows and sunroof on the freeway, even keeping your vehicle rsquo s exterior clean, can reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency. Keeping your vehicle aerodynamically sound is also helpful when specifying your vehicle for fuel mileage and improving fuel efficiency. Check traffic conditions Look up the traffic conditions along your route before taking off. It will help you avoid heavy traffic that can lengthen idling time and increase your fuel consumption. Follow these tips to save fuel. Map out your route, especially for long trips. Avoid roads that cut through known congestion sites. These are usually dotted with intersections, pedestrians, and stoplights and or busy during rush hours. Listen to traffic reports and avoid locations where accidents have taken place or there rsquo s road construction. Look ahead while driving. Keep a proper distance between your vehicle and those in front. Knowing what other cars and pedestrians are doing allows you to anticipate their next move. This helps you keep your speed steady and use less fuel. Checking and actively watching traffic conditions can also improve your safety while driving. How to conserve gas when running low It rsquo s challenging to keep your vehicle running when your tank is nearly empty. Fortunately, there are fuel-saving tips you can follow to conserve gas and keep your vehicle running to the next gas station. Turn off the AC Switching off your air conditioner or heater can help reduce your fuel consumption by 25 . It can be challenging during summer or winter. Even so, sweating or feeling cold for a few minutes beats running out of fuel and getting stuck in the same conditions for hours. Reduce your speed It can be tempting to speed up to get to the closest gas station quickly. Remember, though, the faster you go, the more fuel your vehicle uses. Close the windows Save gas by closing your vehicle rsquo s windows. When traveling at high speeds, wind resistance is improved when the windows are rolled up. An open window can reduce your vehicle rsquo s aerodynamics, creating air resistance that leads to more fuel consumption. How to save fuel as a fleet manager Fleet managers play a crucial role in optimizing fuel consumption and increasing fuel efficiency. Below are tips that fleet managers can use to save fuel. Optimize routes Electronic logging devices , or ELDs, include GPS tracking features you can use to help decrease fuel consumption and increase route management efficiency. Efficient route management ensures that drivers are taking the shortest or most efficient route to their destination. And efficient routing positively impacts the amount of fuel vehicles consume. Fleet managers can use GPS tracking to identify the shortest and least congested routes. Proper fleet management allows you to consolidate trips and ensure drivers aren rsquo t making unnecessary trips that consume more fuel than necessary. Real-time fleet asset management and vehicle monitoring can also help lessen unapproved route deviations. Reduce idling Vehicle idling happens when a vehicle is left running while stopped. Even a still vehicle can increase fuel consumption. Trucks that consume 70,000 of fuel per year are estimated to spend an average of 5,600 on idling. If you rsquo re managing 100 commercial vehicles, you rsquo d be wasting a total of 560,000 every year due to vehicle idling. That rsquo s more than half a million dollars you can easily save by monitoring vehicles and ensuring commercial drivers cut down on idling. The Motive fleet management solution has an idle-time tracking feature that lets fleet managers identify and train drivers who engage in excessive idling. You can also use truck tracking to reduce fuel costs . This allows you to identify drivers who idle for too long or too frequently. Truck tracking even lets you compare drivers rsquo performances across different terminals. Invest in fuel efficiency solutions A robust fuel efficiency solution can give you a consolidated view of your fleet rsquo s fuel consumption. It can help you easily identify which drivers and driving behaviors lead to high fuel consumption. That means you can understand which vehicles are fuel guzzlers. Some fuel maintenance solutions have artificial intelligence AI features that can automatically detect driver behaviors that cause unnecessarily waste fuel. How Motive can help improve fuel efficiency The Motive fleet management solution is packed with features such as idle-time tracking , vehicle diagnostics , and GPS tracking . All these features play crucial roles in minimizing fuel-related expenditures.

            "The world rsquo s first dashcams appeared on the dashboards of police vehicles in the 1930s . The camera rsquo s main purpose was to record traffic violators in the act. Fast forward to the 21st century. Many fleets are installing dashcams in their vehicles to be alerted to incoming hazards and add an extra layer of driver safety. AI dashcams use artificial intelligence to analyze road conditions and driver behavior. They help reduce distracted driving and prevent accidents. How can AI make a dashcam better? Artificial intelligence AI is a burgeoning area of computer science. By interpreting millions of data points, it helps build computers capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Motive rsquo s AI Dashcam is powered by the leading edge AI processor and advanced computer vision algorithms. Together, they detect unsafe driving with industry-leading accuracy. Upon detecting unsafe driving behaviors, such as cell phone use and close following, the AI Dashcam instantly notifies drivers of these behaviors though in-cab audio and visual alerts. The alerts prompt drivers to change their behavior in the crucial seconds that matter most. Read The time for driver-facing cameras is here . How can AI dashcams improve safety and efficiency for fleets? Whether you manage a fleet of delivery vans, long-haul trucks, or construction equipment, an AI dashcam can be the safety solution that improves your safety record and enables you to follow the best fleet management practices . It can also help reduce operating costs , making your fleet safer and more profitable. Improved driver safety The safety of your drivers and your fleet , along with everyone else on the road, is imperative. By installing AI dashcams in your fleet of vehicles, your drivers will be alerted to their high-risk driving behaviors. nbsp By collecting and assessing data about what rsquo s happening on the road, AI-enabled dashcams improve driver safety. When applied, the technology uses predictive analytics and risk mitigation to assess real-time road conditions. The driver will be warned of any oncoming dangers so they can tailor their actions accordingly. Motive rsquo s AI Dashcam also detects where there rsquo s room to improve driver performance. If the driver isn rsquo t adhering to speed limits, or is driving too closely to other vehicles, they rsquo ll receive a notification to change their behavior. Then the driver will receive coaching to encourage safe driving going forward. Lower costs Because AI dashcams help prevent accidents, they can save your business money over time. With safety videos automatically captured and uploaded, the system can suggest in which areas the driver would benefit from coaching. With Motive, drivers are automatically shown personalized videos through the Motive Driver App. Seeing the videos allows drivers to assess what happened on the road and change their behavior as needed. By prompting drivers to change their unsafe driving habits in real time, the AI Dashcam leads to fewer road accidents. That means fleets don rsquo t have to spend as much money on vehicle repairs and maintenance. More importantly, drivers get home safely, and roads are safer for everyone. Under the right conditions, you could also pay less on insurance claims. If your driver is in an accident caused by another road user, the footage captured by the AI dashcam can be sent to insurance companies for review. If the footage proves the driver was not at fault for the accident, the captured footage can be used as evidence to exonerate the driver. Texas-based TZC Services, for example, benefitted from Motive technology when one of their drivers was involved in a collision. Because the recorded footage proved the driver wasn rsquo t at fault, he was immediately exonerated, saving the company millions. There rsquo s also a growing trend among insurance providers offering reduced premiums to fleets that have installed safety devices such as dashcams. Canada rsquo s Tri-Pol Enterprises, for example, used the data correlated from Motive rsquo s dashcams to cut their renewal rate from 45 to only 17 . As the Tri-pol example makes clear, insurance providers are more likely to offer reduced premiums because dashcams have recognizable value in safety and high-quality driver coaching. Efficient fleets Aside from video recording, AI Dashcams interpret analytics to assess general driving data. This technology helps fleets to work more efficiently. For example, monitoring the driver rsquo s location allows fleet managers to detect upcoming route complications, such as heavy congestion. Based on conditions, the manager can suggest alternative routes. The AI also synthesizes the data gathered from regular driving patterns, including average speed, brake usage, travel distances, and fuel consumption. This information can provide greater detail on the vehicle rsquo s performance in areas that could affect fleet efficiency. Why Motive rsquo s AI Dashcam is the safety solution for your fleet If you rsquo re just looking to record footage, a regular dashcam is fine . But the artificial intelligence used in the Motive AI Dashcam gives you more, including high-risk behavior detection and real-time in-cab alerts.

            "The United States sees an average of 30 inches of precipitation annually, including hail, drizzle, sleet, and snow. But, it rsquo s the rain that is most dangerous for commercial drivers. Driver and fleet safety matter. This article shares tips for driving in the rain as a commercial driver and explores how technology can help too. Why is driving in the rain dangerous? Rain is the most dangerous of weather-related driving conditions. According to the Federal Highway Administration , ldquo The vast majority of most weather-related crashes happen on wet pavement and during rainfall 70 on wet pavement and 46 during rainfall. rdquo Even driving in light rain changes the conditions as the roads grow slicker. Storms and heavy rain can also limit visibility. Drivers risk skidding or hydroplaning. Plus, there rsquo s the risk of other vehicle drivers making poor decisions such as driving too fast or aggressively even though the roads are wet. An accident for one driver becomes a dangerous lane obstruction for many others. All these concerns are compounded for commercial drivers, so read on for driving in the rain safety tips. And, get access to additional fleet safety resources . Read 3 ways to coach fleet drivers to safer behavior . Tips for driving in the rain Although people tend to drive more carefully in sleet or snow, they don rsquo t always react with the same caution when it rains. This makes the roads more dangerous for commercial drivers in the rain. Truck and bus drivers not only have to take greater care, but they also have to be wary of other vehicles on the road. Tips for driving in the rain as a truck driver First, try not to be surprised by rain. Check the weather forecast before setting out on a trip. Plus, you rsquo ll know to check tire inflation and to make sure that windshield wipers and window defrosters are working properly. Of course, you won rsquo t always be prepared. When out on the roads in the rain, it rsquo s important for drivers to test their brakes and know to drive slower. It rsquo s going to take longer to come to a complete stop on wet roads. The risk of skidding or hydroplaning can be higher if the truck rsquo s center of balance has changed with cargo shifting unexpectedly on the journey. Remember also to give other vehicles more room and advance notice of your intentions. Avoiding sudden stops and being careful when driving through puddles are also smart tips for driving in the rain. Even after the rain stops, keep an eye out for moving water on the side of the road. This can make the vehicle rsquo s tires lose traction, which can cause you to lose control. Drivers should also be aware of the adverse driving conditions exception , which allows drivers who carry property and who encounter unexpected driving conditions to extend their maximum 14-hour on-duty and 11-hour driving time periods. Tips for driving in the rain as a bus driver Driving a bus in the rain is even more fraught as you could have children on board. That rsquo s another kind of precious cargo! Just as suggested for the truck driver driving in the rain, it rsquo s advisable to check weather conditions before setting out. Bus drivers can also proactively confirm that their bus is in optimal shape to handle the expected rain. On the roads, we rsquo ll reiterate the importance of driving slower and testing brakes. Avoiding aggressive driving behaviors and signaling any lane changes well in advance can also help other drivers. After all, they rsquo re going to need longer to react and are suffering visibility challenges too. Be especially wary in the first 10 minutes after the rain begins. This is a particularly dangerous time as the rain will mix with the oil on the road to make roads slicker. After the rain washes the oil away, the roads will be safer but you should still drive cautiously. How to respond to a skid in the rain First, let rsquo s clarify the difference between skidding and hydroplaning . Skidding happens on slick roads while hydroplaning occurs when standing water on the road is deep enough that the treads lose contact with the road. The National Safety Commission tells us ldquo this can occur at speeds as low as 35 mph and becomes most dangerous at 55 mph or more. rdquo Nevertheless, you rsquo ll respond to both skidding and hydroplaning in the same way. If you begin to lose control of the car, remove your foot from the gas. Don rsquo t slam on the brakes. The best braking behavior depends on your type of brakes. Those with standard brakes won rsquo t want to apply the brakes. If the skid started while applying the brakes, remove your foot from the pedal. Only in an anti-lock braking system ABS vehicle does it help to apply firm pressure when you start to skid or hydroplane. Drivers in a bus with an automatic transmission will want to downshift one gear. A standard transmission bus will slow down more on its own, but shifting to neutral or depressing the clutch will help. Turn in the direction of the skid mdash the direction the front of your car wants to go mdash until you regain full control and the car has slowed on its own. Tips for driving in the rain at night Driving in the rain at night? Turn on your vehicle rsquo s lights. Turning on your high beam lights isn rsquo t a good idea, though, as they will be too reflective and can make it more difficult for both you and other drivers to see. In fact, drivers are required to turn on vehicle headlights when it rains in many states day or night . This is meant to improve your visibility and the ability of other drivers to see you. A newer car comes with automated running lights but, in the rain, turning the actual headlights on will also turn on the backlights. State Farm notes it rsquo s also good practice to dim the dashboard lights, which can reduce glare. Additionally, avoid looking at oncoming headlights and ventilate your car to help reduce fog forming inside your windows. Why shouldn rsquo t you use hazard lights in the rain? When driving in heavy rain, you may also see drivers turn on their hazard lights. However, several states have made this illegal. ldquo Hazard lights are for vehicles that are stopped and pulled over on the side of the road. It is not for moving vehicles, rdquo Public Safety Information Coordinator Eddy Durkin told AccuWeather . ldquo So mdash regardless of the weather conditions mdash if you are driving a moving vehicle, do not activate your flashing lights it will only cause confusion and compromise your safety. rdquo Why should you avoid cruise control in the rain? It rsquo s never a good idea to use cruise control in the rain. Yes, cruise control can help with speed and fuel management. Yet, if using cruise control in the rain, the vehicle will respond exactly the wrong way to a skid situation. When cruise control detects that your tires are starting to spin, it corrects this by increasing vehicle speed. Instead, you want to take your foot off the gas. How to keep safe in all weather conditions with Motive These rainy weather safety tips will help commercial drivers. Yet, the person in the driver seat doesn rsquo t need to be solely responsible for safe driving in challenging weather conditions. Motive rsquo s fleet safety solution maps weather conditions in fleet view and helps fleet managers plan the entire route in advance with safety in mind, simplifying the process of vehicle fleet management . Our DRIVE program contextualizes critical safety events, considering weather as well as road conditions and driver action and more. This lets your safety department see specific driver scores and behaviors to immediately take action. Another risk when driving in the rain? Distracted driving .

            "A telematics system and fleet management software can help fleet managers and decision-makers improve their day-to-day workflow for smarter and faster fleet operations. What is telematics? Telematics is the process of transmitting information remotely over long distances. Today, telematics is used in various industries for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Telematics blends two science disciplines telecommunications and informatics. Telecommunications refers to communication over a distance, and informatics is the practice of information processing. A decade ago, the word telematics didn t even exist. Due to the rise of the internet and communication over networks, it has become a critical aspect of successful fleet operations. Telematics has helped various industries improve communications, efficiency, and customer service by allowing seamless, remote data transfer and increasing visibility into operations. What is fleet telematics? The trucking industry uses fleet telematics to gather data using a combination of GPS technology, sensors, and onboard diagnostics codes. The gathered data generally includes vehicle location, driver behavior, vehicle activity, and real-time engine diagnostics . Fleet owners and managers can manage assets remotely using telematics technology via a designated software or platform. A fleet telematics system usually consists of two components The GPS tracking device, which is generally installed in the vehicle s on-board diagnostic port The fleet communication software system, most often located at a dispatch center or fleet manager s office Fleets within the trucking industry usually install telematics devices and accompanying fleet management software to collect and transmit a broad range of information. That information can comprise Speeding Vehicle maintenance issues Vehicle location via real-time GPS and asset tracking Vehicle usage Fuel consumption Rapid acceleration Hard braking Hard cornering Idling time to minimize fuel consumption Information from telematics and GPS fleet tracking systems provide in-depth insights into the fleet. Fleet managers can then use these insights to help identify at-risk drivers, improve fleet safety, reduce fuel waste, and lower operating expenses. How does telematics work? The following infographic explains how data is transmitted remotely via telematics. The telematics device is generally connected to the vehicle s onboard diagnostics port with a SIM card. A modem allows communicating the collected data via a wireless network to a central server. The server then reads the data and displays it through a secure website, either on a computer or mobile application, enabling the end user, such as a fleet manager, to interpret the data and make more informed decisions regarding fleet efficiency. What industries use telematics systems? The most common industries that use telematics systems are Delivery and courier companies Field sales and services, such as plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning HVAC , etc. Trucking and transportation logistics Car rental and leasing companies Towing companies Food and beverage businesses Construction companies Utilities Transit fleets, such as motorcoach, public transit, taxi, and paratransit First responders, police, and other public agencies Landscaping Oil, gas, and mining industries Waste management fleets Why install a telematics device? Many fleets see telematics as a crucial technology for fleet management. Safety is one of the biggest reasons fleet owners install telematics. Other features include in-vehicle coaching, driver behavior reporting, incident notification and reconstruction, and tracking stolen vehicles. Improved customer service is another reason. Using real-time GPS tracking , trip reporting, and routing tools improves productivity and helps fleets provide better service to their customers. Cutting delivery times is also a benefit that s top of mind for fleet managers. With a quality telematics system, dispatchers and fleet managers can accurately track their fleet to determine when their drivers arrive at their destination. The ability to tell a customer exactly where their cargo is and precisely when it will arrive can quickly help build trust between the company and the customer. Integration with onboard camera technology is another area where telematics is helpful. For example, when Motive customer Nybll, a California-based health food service provider, was involved in a collision, their driver was exonerated due to video proof from an installed dashcam. How are telematics devices installed in trucks? 1. Better efficiency and productivity Some telematics devices are plug and play, while others require engineers and support staff for proper installation and setup. The power requirements of telematics devices also vary. They can either be battery-powered or powered by the vehicle s internal electrical system. What other vehicles can use telematics? Telematics can perform a number of functions in multiple vehicle types and assets, including Heavy equipment. The construction industry typically uses telematics for heavy earth-moving equipment. It can track equipment utilization to boost job site productivity, reduce fuel burn, and enable preventative maintenance. Cars. Besides performing crucial vehicle maintenance and productivity functions for company car and sales fleets, telematics is also used to track private mileage. This helps ensure health and safety compliance, which is a vital aspect of an employers duty of care. Single axle and tractor units. Telematics helps with route optimization and scheduling, driver hour management, fuel management , and driver behavior reporting for tractor and single axle unit operations. Cargo vans and pickup trucks. Companies with pickup trucks and cargo vans in their fleet often use telematics for time-on-site reporting. Other uses include job dispatching and routing, making timesheets as proof of delivery solutions, reporting, tracking driver behavior, and monitoring unauthorized vehicle use. Buses and coaches. Telematics helps streamline driver hour management, fuel management including engine idling , and route optimization and scheduling. Bus and coach fleets also use telematics for driver behavior reporting and service integrations i.e., through time of arrival alerts . Specialist vehicles. A range of specialist vehicles, including dump trucks, tow trucks, and cement trucks, use telematics. The technology allows users to better understand vehicle activity through power take-off and where mechanical power is transferred to other pieces of equipment. How can my fleet use a telematics system? Fleets of all types and sizes can use and benefit from a telematics system. Telematics data empowers fleet managers and administrators to solve unique business challenges and make data-driven decisions. It provides valuable information on each vehicle or asset s location, which can help Fleets gain visibility into operations Increase efficiency and productivity Prevent vehicle theft Provide better delivery estimates to clients Increase customer satisfaction and potentially save thousands of dollars Benefits of a telematics system With advanced telematics systems and data, fleets can simplify operations and driver management and get a better return on investment ROI . Here are eight benefits of telematics for fleets of all types and sizes 1. Increased efficiency and productivity Telematics for fleet management allows for real-time vehicle location tracking through GPS. With the help of real-time vehicle monitoring and location history, fleet managers can identify the best and most efficient routes, improve driver safety, speed up deliveries, and minimize fuel expenditures. Apart from using a real-time fleet GPS tracking solution , geofencing can also play a key role in increasing efficiency and productivity. Geofencing allows for tracking performance against delivery schedules and can also help reduce detention time. On average, driver detention at shippers and receivers can cost up to 1,280 per driver per year . 2. Reduced fuel wastage and operational expenses Fleets use telematics systems to determine the quickest and shortest routes, which cuts delivery times . Through smart route planning, fuel efficiency improves since vehicles aren t consuming fuel by traveling long routes. Telematics systems can also reduce vehicle idling since they can identify which drivers are idling too long. Fleet managers can ask drivers with unusually long idle times about the challenges they re facing so they can come up with a solution. Some fleet management software can automate idle tracking and present vehicle utilization rates for each driver. Through smarter route planning, monitoring idling across your fleet, and leveraging a reliable maintenance fuel solution, you can significantly cut down your operational expenses. 3. Better payroll management Fleet managers can automate employee records and streamline payroll management. Automating helps ease administrative and clerical work and minimize errors. It becomes easier to calculate payroll when you know exactly how far and for how long each vehicle was driven. 4. Improved safety Safety is a top priority for fleets of all types and sizes. Even a small collision on the road can potentially cripple a business. According to the FMCSA The average cost of a collision involving a fatality is 3,600,000 . A collision with injuries costs nearly 200,000. The average cost of collisions is reportedly 91,000 per incident. Combining the power of a modern-day fleet safety solution, fleet management software, and telematics systems enable fleets to correct and improve driver behavior and increase road safety. Fleet management software can rank drivers based on safety scores as the system collects more behavior data. This helps safety managers identify drivers with the worst and best performances across the fleet so they can develop driving coaching programs. 5. Driver exoneration According to a large truck crash causation study, 56 of passenger vehicles and 44 of trucks were responsible for crashes in two-vehicle accidents between a truck and a passenger car. But without any evidence, fleets have no way to exonerate their drivers when they re not at fault. Dashcam footage can change that. Dashcam-recorded video footage is almost always admissible in court, and fleets can use it to exonerate innocent drivers and save the company from potential liabilities. D amp A McRae Transportation is a fleet whose driver was saved with the help of footage recorded by the Motive Smart Dashcam. Rod Conrad, the Terminal Manager with D amp A McRae, says, We would have immediately been deemed to be at fault. Footage from Motive s Smart Dashcam exonerated our driver and saved us what could have been close to 50,000 in damages. From this one incident, the Smart Dashcam paid for itself. 6. Proactive vehicle maintenance One of the biggest benefits of using telematics is identifying vehicle maintenance issues remotely and alerting the team in real time. Fleet managers can leverage automation features to schedule preventive maintenance after taking Hours of Service HOS information into account. According to the CVSA International Roadcheck 2019 results , 16,347 vehicles went out of service that year out of 24 of the total inspections. The top three out-of-service vehicle conditions were Braking systems 28 Tires and wheels 19.3 Brake adjustment 17.1 Advanced telematics lets you catch many vehicle maintenance issues early with vehicle fault-code detection and real-time alerts. This can help you quickly identify potential vehicle issues, prevent critical violations, safeguard CSA scores , and potentially save thousands of dollars. 7. Streamlined communication Fleet management software allows for more streamlined communication between drivers and back office staff. Better communication, along with accurate vehicle location tracking and geofencing , can help you provide better delivery estimates to your customers and keep them happy. 8. Reduced unauthorized use Telematics can track drivers via a driver identification system. When fleet managers detect drivers using vehicles they shouldn t be, they can contact the driver to inform them of the mistake. For example, drivers might mistakenly use vehicles that are scheduled for repairs and end up causing a crash on the road. How much does telematics cost? Figuring out the cost of a telematics system is a relatively straightforward process. You often pay for the cost of the device, installation, and a monthly subscription fee. When you incorporate a telematics system into your fleet, you re paying for valuable information, such as vehicle data and insights that you otherwise wouldn t be able to obtain. Most telematics systems currently on the market have reasonably clear-cut costs that you can evaluate. Fleet telematics costs First, you ll pay for the device itself. Depending on the size of your fleet, many telematics companies offer quantity discounts. Telematics device cost variables The cost of the device largely depends on the type of device you choose. Some telematics devices transmit data in real time, while others transmit at a predetermined interval, such as every hour or half-hour. A device that transmits in real time is a smarter device with more advanced technology built in. Opting for a cheaper device that transmits data only at certain intervals can cause delays in trucking operations and hinder fleet managers from taking immediate action in case of emergencies. Telematics installation costs The next factor affecting the overall cost of the telematics system is installation. The best devices are plug-and-play and can easily be installed into the vehicle diagnostic port. Sometimes, vehicle telematics companies don t charge for installation. Other devices may require a technician to install. If you choose a device that needs to be hardwired or retrofitted, the installation costs will be higher. Monthly subscription fees Finally, the monthly subscription fee will determine the total cost of your fleet telematics system. Since the data provided by telematics systems is critical to optimizing fleet operations and lowering the cost of doing business, it s important to choose a highly-rated and reliable service provider. There are much cheaper solutions but they often only offer the most basic features and poor support. The future of telematics Telematics is an essential component of the trucking and transportation businesses. Many fleets acknowledge that the system could pay for itself in savings elsewhere. The trucking industry is evolving with the introduction of electronic logging devices and the ELD mandate . There s also a renewed focus on technology and safety. Fleet management software and telematics devices will continue to play a major role for fleets looking to gain a competitive advantage. After all, telematics data can help fleet administrators become more proactive and efficient.

            "The ELD mandate in Canada is heading toward full implementation. Drivers and fleets in the U.S. and Canada should understand the Canadian ELD mandate and how it differs from the U.S. ELD mandate. That rsquo s because the Canadian ELD mandate will apply to qualifying Canadian drivers and to U.S. drivers crossing the Canadian border. To comply with the Canadian ELD mandate, non-exempt drivers will need a compliant ELD solution. In this post, we rsquo ll discuss the requirements for the ELD mandate in Canada and how to buy a compliant ELD solution . An overview of the ELD mandate in Canada According to the Canadian ELD mandate, non-exempt drivers must use compliant electronic logging devices ELDs to capture their Hours of Service HOS . The purpose of the Canadian mandate is to help create a safe road environment for commercial drivers and others. With full enforcement of the Canadian ELD mandate coming on January 1, 2023, experts recommend that fleets adopt ELD technology as soon as possible. Doing so will help fleets avoid violations and operational disruptions. Non-compliant drivers will be subject to fines, out-of-service orders, and potential criminal citations during roadside inspections. Non-compliant carriers will be subject to enhanced enforcement scrutiny and possible safety rating downgrades. To avoid service disruptions, it rsquo s crucial to implement an approved ELD before the January 1, 2023 enforcement deadline. As Motive customers in Canada work toward full compliance with the ELD mandate, they can count on our support and technology for help in meeting their ELD obligations. How to ensure ELD compliance in Canada Although the ELD mandate in Canada applies to most commercial drivers, there are some exemptions. If you rsquo re not exempt, you rsquo ll need a compliant ELD solution to help you comply with the mandate. ELDs in Canada must be in compliance with the technical specifications published in the Canadian ELD mandate. Before installation, ELDs must be certified by a third party. It rsquo s one of the major differences between the U.S. and Canadian mandates. The U.S. mandate allows for self-certification by device manufacturers. Carriers who operate between the two countries should have an ELD that meets the certification standards of both countries. That rsquo s where it gets a little tricky. Transport Canada requires third-party certification of ELDs that can be used in Canada. The Motive electronic logging device ELD is now fully certified on both Android and iOS for the Canadian ELD mandate. Our reliable, easy-to-use ELD has helped fleets stay compliant in Canada and in the U.S. since 2017. With this certification, customers can continue to operate confidently and meet their ELD compliance obligations. To ensure compliance with ELD requirements , the Canadian mandate requires that all ELD providers undergo rigorous technical testing with an accredited third-party certification body. After passing extensive road and bench testing with the accredited certification body CSA Group, Motive is officially listed on Transport Canada rsquo s website as an approved provider. The extensive vetting means that Canadian fleets can feel confident relying on Motive to help manage their compliance needs. Tips to prepare for enforcement of the ELD mandate in Canada Complying with the ELD mandate in Canada goes beyond buying and installing an ELD. The most successful fleets also spend time familiarizing themselves with the new compliance workflows. Here are two simple steps to help you prepare for a smooth transition. 1. Train your team early The best way to prepare for the upcoming ELD mandate is to adopt ELD technology in advance then train your drivers and back-office staff on how to use it. Show your team how to log Hours of Service HOS , avoid violations, and toggle between Canadian and U.S. rules. To practice using Canadian-specific functionality, customers can download our highly rated Driver App on Google Play or the Apple App Store . Get comfortable with features such as deferral of hours, yard move and personal conveyance limits, and Alberta cycle rules. Any questions can be offloaded to our Canadian ELD experts 24 hours per day, seven days per week. 2. Be prepared for roadside inspections For a smooth roadside inspection , make sure your fleet rsquo s electronic logs are up to date and certified. It rsquo s helpful to know where to access required documentation, whether it rsquo s in printed or digital form. Also, make sure you understand the differences in how Canada and the U.S. inspect electronic record of duty status RODS , including ELD records. Many U.S. fleets waited until the last minute to prepare for the U.S. ELD mandate. As a result, drivers and fleets had to scramble to meet the deadline. ELD providers were slammed with so many last-minute requests that fleets were left waiting, and drivers without an approved ELD installed were placed out of service until compliant. Determining the right fit for your fleet To establish the best fit for your company, review and evaluate several fleet management software and ELD solutions . Below are ELD and fleet management features that can help you comply with the ELD mandate in Canada. Easy ELD installation. How long does the ELD solution take to install? How easy is it to set up? Look for an ELD that rsquo s easy to install and operate. It will make complying with the Canadian mandate that much more efficient. Critical safety features. Fleets of all sizes need to prioritize driver safety. It rsquo s important to have real-time visibility into high-risk events such as speeding, excessive acceleration and hard cornering. Some ELDs work with built-in dashcams. Dashcams can capture and record unsafe driving events such as erratic lane changes and accidents. GPS tracking capabilities. Having an ELD with precise GPS tracking ability lets fleet managers know where their vehicles and assets are located at all times. Real-time and historical vehicle location information helps managers operate more efficiently, plan better routes, and provide better customer service. Positive online reviews. Unbiased reviews of ELDs are available on many independent platforms. Look for reviews on ELD Devices, the Apple App Store, and Google Play. Ease of use. Look for an ELD solution that rsquo s user-friendly and intuitive. Getting an easy-to-use ELD will reduce your training time dramatically. That means drivers can get out on the road faster. Enhanced communications with drivers and dispatchers. The best ELD solution will allow managers to instantly message drivers individually and as a group. Drivers can send receipts and proof of delivery documents directly to managers through an ELD app . Vehicle performance notifications. Fuel waste and downtime for maintenance can increase operating costs. A good ELD solution allows you to increase uptime. It does it by creating and sending reports that can save money and time. The ELD should also help track fuel consumption, fuel waste, and vehicle diagnostics. ELD costs and benefits Apart from ensuring compliance with various regulations, ELDs impove efficiency and productivity. ELDs can help you avoid costly and disruptive Hours of Service HOS violations. In the U.S., fines for ELD violations range from 1,000 up to 10,000. Each day a driver is out of service can cost up to 264 in lost revenue. An operator found to be in violation of some out-of-service orders can be liable for up to 25,000 in penalties. ELDs can help protect fleets from these unnecessary costs. ELDs also help streamline communication among drivers and back-office staff. One of the biggest ELD benefits of a feature-rich ELD solution is its ability to automate IFTA calculation. It does it by recording how many miles each vehicle drives in each jurisdiction. This feature reduces administrative tasks and operating expenses. Automated IFTA reports are also less prone to errors. Discover solutions for all your compliance and fleet management needs As your long-term partner, Motive goes beyond helping you meet the ELD mandate Canada requirements.

            "Safety is a big concern to everyone on the road. According to the 2018 Driver Safety Risk Report, trucking collisions cost fleets nearly 57 billion . The downtime affects everything from medical bills to vehicle repairs to lost productivity. Annual insurance rates could also increase by about a third for collisions that damage both the driver and the vehicle. Even a crash without injuries could raise insurance rates by almost a quarter. However, less than half of all carriers use commercial truck driver safety programs to reduce the risk of road collisions and accidents. To help fleets improve truck driver safety, we ve assembled a list of fleet safety tips for truck drivers. These commercial driving safety tips will help increase fleet driver safety , improve fleet risk management , and reduce the risk of collisions on the road. 1. Avoid distracted driving Distracted driving is one of the leading causes of road collisions. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports 2,841 lives were lost in 2018 due to distracted driving , and over 23,000 between 2012-2018. Distracted drivers made up 9 of fatal crashes in the past seven years. Delayed driver reaction causes 90 of rear-end collisions. Drivers can get distracted. Grabbing a bite while driving to save some time. Lighting a cigarette. Talking on the phone or texting. Improve fleet safety with AI-powered dash cams and coaching. Truck drivers operating larger vehicles need to be extra vigilant. These vehicles are harder to maneuver. Take longer to decelerate. And have more blind spots or ldquo no zones. rdquo It s important that drivers get the message that distractions are a big risk when driving a commercial vehicle. See how Motive customers are using the AI Dashcam to root out distracted driving . 2. Know your blind spots Visibility is paramount for fleet driver safety and preventing road collisions. Especially when operating a large commercial vehicle, which has more blind spots than a standard passenger vehicle. Increasing safety and awareness can save lives. Identify not only your truck rsquo s potential blind spots but also other vehicles rsquo . Keep lane changes to a minimum. Check your side view mirrors at least once every 10 seconds. 3. Use a dash cam to improve driver safety Technology has transformed the trucking industry over the last few years. ELDs , fleet management software , GPS tracking , and dash cams have improved driver safety. Dashboard cameras or dash cams also enrich truck driver safety training and coaching programs , lower CSA scores , and disprove fake insurance claims. Fleets of all types and sizes benefit from using dashcams. They protect their drivers from false claims. Expedite insurance processes. Increase accountability. And, improve driver behavior and fleet safety . Truck dashcams can spot other vehicles changing lanes without signaling and braking harshly, among other things. The dashcams can be mounted on either the windshield or dashboard. They can also be single-facing or dual-facing. The important thing is that they show what really happens on the road. For example, Utah-based trucking company D amp A McRae started using the Smart Dashcam by Motive earlier this year and saw immediate returns on their investment . Within just a few months of installing a dash cam, a driver was involved in a collision and deemed at fault. His team remotely downloaded footage from the incident and exonerated the driver. ldquo Footage from Motive rsquo s dash cam exonerated our driver on the spot and saved us what could have been close to 50K in damages. From this one incident, the dashcam paid for itself. rdquo ndash Rod Conrad, Terminal Manager, D amp A McRae Transportation 4. Know your safe braking distance For drivers of smaller vehicles, it might take time to get used to the much larger braking distance of a large commercial truck. It really comes down to simple physics The bigger the rig, the longer it takes to stop. For example, compared to an average-sized car, it takes an 18-wheeler 40 longer to stop . A fully loaded tractor-trailer traveling at 55 mph on dry pavement will travel approximately 390 more feet in 4.5 seconds before stopping . Fleet safety managers should ensure that drivers complete a driver training program. They may also want to create training videos so their safety messages are promoted clearly and concisely, or offer defensive driving techniques that compare the differences in braking distances. Road-facing dashcam footage can also be used to identify if a driver is driving too close to a vehicle. That dash cam video can trigger a driver coaching program to remedy the problem. 5. Follow the hours-of-service rules The hours-of-service HOS rules help drivers minimize fatigue and increase road safety. Driver fatigue is a leading cause of road collisions . Adhering to your HOS limit reduces this risk. Stay in compliance by following the HOS regulations that apply to you. 6. Be aware of aggressive tailgaters The main theory behind defensive driving is to steer clear of aggressive and reckless drivers. Tailgaters won rsquo t be able to safely decelerate if you have to make a sudden stop. The best way to avoid a potential accident is to switch lanes instead of accelerating. This allows the tailgaters to pass you and be on their way. Also, remember to use your turn signals when you rsquo re changing lanes. 7. Follow all road signs Road signs are there for a reason. Pay close attention to road signs and local traffic rules in the area where you rsquo re driving. Occasionally, truck drivers go over the enforced speed limit if they rsquo re running late or detained by a shipper or receiver. Speeding may cause them to lose control of their vehicle. Especially when maneuvering through sudden, sharp curves mdash or with uneven surfaces, construction hazards, and other road irregularities. 8. Avoid hard braking, acceleration, and cornering Hard braking, acceleration, and cornering are more common than you think. Drivers should avoid excessive acceleration, speeding, hard cornering, and braking to stay safe on the road. Create driver training programs to reduce the likelihood of these incidents. These driver coaching programs can promote good commercial driving habits and minimize critical safety events. Following the standard CDL driver safety tips also helps educate drivers on the basics of commercial vehicle driving. Fleets can also improve driver safety by using the latest technology to monitor drivers for these critical safety events. Some electronic logging devices can help simplify and automate that process. For example, the Motive ELD solution has a driver scorecards feature. This feature automatically ranks drivers according to how safely they drive. Drivers are ranked based on their safety scores mdash which are calculated on the basis of the critical safety events. Moreover, with the power of AI and DRIVE score, Motive also provides accurate context for critical safety events by considering additional factors, such as location, weather, vehicle make, etc. With this safety score, safety managers can easily identify at-risk drivers who require immediate coaching. Truck driver safety tips for different seasons and weather conditions Truck drivers drive in different weather conditions, locations, terrains, and weather conditions. We have so far covered commercial driving safety tips that should apply to most drivers in common conditions. Here are some specific driving safety tips for commercial drivers for different seasons or weather conditions. Safety tips for commercial drivers driving in the rain You rsquo ll encounter rainy conditions at some point in your driving career. Sometimes very unexpectedly. Driving a car in the rain can be dangerous but driving a large commercial vehicle carries with it even more potential hazards. Important safety guidelines during rainy conditions include Always wearing your seat belt Keeping your lights on Keeping your radio on with low volume Changing speeds gradually Avoiding driving into water over the roadway Driving more slowly Increasing your following distance Not using your cruise control or engine brake Not overdriving Fleet driver safety driving in winter Winter driving can be beautiful and dangerous at the same time. Follow some basic guidelines when it comes to driving in the winter weather Wear your seat belt. Before you drive, make a contingency plan to account for poor weather conditions. Pay attention to your dashboard warning lights. Extreme temperatures can wreck havoc on your emissions control system as well as other temperature-sensitive functions. Be aware of conditions that might limit your visibility. Keep your headlights on at all times if visibility is low. Make sure you have plenty of room between your vehicle and the others. Don rsquo t ride alongside snow plows. Leave at least 200 feet of space between you and other snow service vehicles on the road. Sudden braking can be dangerous with slick road conditions. Don rsquo t use your cruise control and make sure to avoid abrupt driving maneuvers. Use caution and slow down when approaching curves and intersections to reduce the chance of losing control. Icy conditions occur most often on bridges and overpasses. Don rsquo t let your truck idle in cold weather. The Diesel Exhaust Fluid DEF tank freezes at about 10 degrees Fahrenheit when the vehicle isn rsquo t in motion. Remove ice and snow from your rooftop before driving to improve visibility. Make sure you have solid footing when entering and exiting vehicle cabs. Wear appropriate footwear for the weather conditions, and be aware of ice and snow on surfaces. If you have to stop, find a safe spot to do it. If you can rsquo t get off of the road, make sure your truck is as visible as possible. Use your emergency triangles, cones, flashers, and a reflective vest. Always try to keep at least a half tank of gas during winter. Along with the correctly blended fuel, this will keep your fuel lines from freezing. If you find yourself in a skid, remember to turn into the skid. Depress the clutch quickly. Look in your left mirror. Steer and counter-steer as fast as you can to get back in front of the trailer. Keep an emergency supply of water, non-perishable food, clothes, and blankets in case of a breakdown. If you don rsquo t feel comfortable driving, park your vehicle. Driving safety tips driving in the summer Summers seem to be getting hotter and longer. And spending hours behind the wheel in the blistering heat can be dangerous. Your vehicle can also behave differently in extreme summer conditions. Here are a few commercial driver safety tips to beat the heat and stay safe during summer driving. Keep yourself hydrated. If you rsquo re jogging, playing golf, or simply working outside during the summer, you stay hydrated. The same goes for when you rsquo re driving. Keep a few bottles of water or a sports drink with you while you rsquo re driving, and remember to drink them regularly. Dehydration may lead to dizziness and a change in blood pressure level. Which may affect your driving performance and lead to accidents. Make sure your tires are properly inflated. When the temperature rises in the summer, the risk of blowouts increases. Tires that are under-inflated can increase that risk. So make sure you have properly inflated tires before you drive. Check the brakes. Check that your brakes are in good working order before driving. Remember, high temperatures often impact friction in the braking system due to extreme heat. Be conscious of summertime traffic. Roads tend to be busier during summer with families taking vacations. This presents even more danger than usual for truck drivers. Be extra aware of other vehicles on the road. Driving safety tips for tow-truck drivers While we rsquo ve covered many safety issues for commercial vehicle drivers, we can rsquo t overlook commercial tow-truck drivers. Tow-truck drivers also face inherent risks in their day-to-day operations. Here are some safety tips for tow-truck drivers regarding general tow-truck safety Be prepared . Before heading on the road to rescue a vehicle, make sure you and your vehicle are ready to go. Tow truck safety begins with a regular inspection of your vehicle and its equipment. Remember your defensive driving training . Always observe posted speed limits. Keep a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. If you have a vehicle in tow, reduce your speed even more. Extend your following distance to give you enough time to stop with the added weight. Be safe .Turn on your safety lights. Place down your safety cones, flares, and other markers. And make sure pedestrians and other vehicles are out of the way. Using personal protective equipment is required in many states. Make yourself more visible and safe by wearing long pants and closed-toe shoes. And don rsquo t forget to use your work gloves and safety glasses. Remember, if you rsquo re responding to an accident, there will most likely be broken glass, dangerous chemicals, or fuel on the road. Be seen . Make sure everybody knows you rsquo re there and working by wearing your safety vest. The flashing lights and reflectors on your vehicle can also increase your visibility. Know your limits. Weight limits are there for a reason. To ensure safe driving, know what your vehicle is capable of handling and then decide if the job is right for you and your vehicle. Above all, stay safe Even though passenger vehicles are at fault in almost 85 of truck-passenger vehicle crashes, commercial drivers are more likely to be blamed. That rsquo s why it rsquo s important for every fleet to build a comprehensive safety program that champions the latest technology and data to keep their drivers safe. In conclusion, here s a simple truck safety inspection checklist that drivers can review each time they take to the road Obey all posted speed limits. Always practice defensive driving. Don rsquo t use distracting devices while driving. Wear your seatbelt. Be well-rested. Check your vehicle before driving. Double-check your route and stick to it. Don rsquo t drink and drive. Make sure you rsquo re carrying all of your documentation. For more information and driving safety tips, consult the CDL manual .

            "National Truck Driver Appreciation Week takes place September 10-16 this year, reminding us of the ways 3.6 million U.S. truck drivers keep freight and society moving. Drivers sacrifices aren t often top of mind for the millions of Americans they serve. Truck Driver Appreciation Week puts their efforts in the spotlight. Elisabeth Barna , Executive Vice President of Industry Affairs and Senior Adviser at the American Trucking Associations ATA , talks about the motivation behind National Truck Driver Appreciation Week and the difference it rsquo s making mdash from greater awareness to safer performance. National Truck Driver Appreciation Week is now celebrated in all 50 states The idea for National Truck Driver Appreciation Week originated with former ATA Chairman Don Bowman , who felt drivers were under-appreciated. He wanted to increase public awareness about the important work drivers do, and in 1998, National Truck Driver Appreciation Week was born. ldquo Setting aside a week to recognize truck drivers was a way to give them the respect they deserve, rdquo Barna says. ldquo It was a way to highlight the important role drivers play in our everyday lives. Without them, store shelves would be empty. We wouldn rsquo t have the clothes on our backs or the medicines we need. Simply put, everything we have, a truck delivered. rdquo What started as an awareness-raising advertising campaign has grown into a national movement supported by trucking associations in all 50 states. In the two decades since it started, National Truck Driver Appreciation Week has become a time of celebration from coast to coast. Local and national media have contributed to its rise, as drivers are spotlighted on TV, billboards, and social media. Fleets host safety days and barbecues. Truck stops and weigh stations offer giveaways and free lunches, and shippers offer giveaways of their own. Taken together, these events send a powerful and positive message that professional drivers keep our world moving. Driving for the well-being of others Truck Driver Appreciation Week inspires us to reflect on the sacrifices drivers make every day. Products that fill our lives and power our economy, such as food, clothing, medicine, and materials, are all made available thanks to the drivers behind the wheel. ldquo During the pandemic, the truck driver became recognized as the hero, rdquo Barna says. ldquo As drivers efforts were highlighted in the media, they gained respect from the general public, from shippers, and from public officials. Americans came to realize that without trucks, without drivers, America stops. rdquo In boosting morale, National Truck Driver Appreciation Week creates other positive outcomes As a special commemoration during Truck Driver Appreciation Week, the ATA is orchestrating video tributes from the supplier community. Media interviews will encourage people to share the road with trucks day and night. Truck Driver Appreciation Week acknowledges drivers in every sector, from logistics and distribution to agriculture and moving amp storage. ldquo Truck Driver Appreciation Week instills in drivers pride in their community and a passion for the job at hand, rdquo Barna says. ldquo It inspires them to take pride in what they do and who they are. That means they rsquo ll be well-rested before they start their shift and can perform their job as safely as possible. When drivers take pride in their work, they tend to be more conscientious, more vigilant, and safer. rdquo ldquo Like anyone, rdquo Barna adds. ldquo when drivers are passionate about their work, they do their very best. rdquo As Truck Driver Appreciation Week has fueled pride among drivers, it rsquo s demolished stereotypes. It all started with the launch of ATA rsquo s image campaign, Trucking Moves America Forward . The effort encourages professionals in every sector of the transportation industry to tell their story and talk about what they do. Over time, the campaign has helped educate the public and burnish the reputations of commercial transportation workers . ldquo Whether it rsquo s keeping car drivers safe on our roadways or delivering medicine and food, we rsquo ve gotten a little spoiled in being able to get what we want from truck drivers when we want it, rdquo Barna says. ldquo You don rsquo t see a train or steamboat pulling up to a store or hospital, delivering the products we need to live on. Truck Driver Appreciation Week puts a face on the people behind the wheel and helps Americans understand mdash it rsquo s professional truck drivers who are making it all happen. rdquo\n",

            "This guide covers what dynamic routing is, its benefits and downsides, and the differences between dynamic and static routing. Learn how to implement dynamic routing with a robust solution for improved workflows and route optimization. A solution, shall we say, like Motive. What is dynamic routing? Dynamic routing is the process of selecting the best path a data packet must follow through a network to reach a specific destination. Known as adaptive routing, dynamic routing is a technique where a router obtains routing information without an administrator rsquo s assistance. The router adds the optimal path to a routing table and determines alternative routes if the primary path becomes less ideal or unavailable. Dynamic routing also refers to automated path-planning methods that compute routing operations through protocols and complex algorithms. How dynamic routing works Here rsquo s how dynamic routing works The router sends and receives routing messages on the router interfaces. Routers share the messages and information with other routers using the same protocol. Routers exchange routing information to uncover data about remote networks. In this way, when an internetwork gets reconfigured or a router goes down, each router rsquo s routing tables can undergo proper adjustment. When a router discovers topology modifications, the routing protocol advertises these changes to other routers. Dynamic routing uses two algorithms mdash distance vector protocols and link state protocols mdash to calculate multiple possible paths and then choose the optimal route for traffic to travel through the network. Both protocols develop a routing table within the router. The table includes an entry for every potential destination of a network, specific subnet, or group of networks. Each entry identifies a specific network connection with which to transmit a received data packet. When using distance vector protocols, every routing table indicates the particular number of hops to every destination. The router relays its table to every directly connected router and receives other routers rsquo tables in return. Routers employing distance vector protocols regularly exchange their tables with other routers in proximity. Link state protocols select routes by swapping a link state packet LSP with nearby routers. Every router builds an LSP with its preconfigured identifier and information about connected subnets and networks. The router then transmits the LSP to neighboring routers. Received LSPs hold additional details about link data rates and paths to other networks. Routers integrate this information with known data and store it in their routing tables. In this way, link state protocols produce a full network view and enable routers in an internetwork to hold identical information. Understanding dynamic routing protocols Dynamic routing operates with multiple protocols and algorithms that enable routers to exchange network information with other routers. With that capability, routers can choose the optimal path to arrive at a destination. The primary dynamic routing protocol is the Open Shortest Path First OSPF . OSPF OSPF is a link state routing protocol that creates its paths with a mathematical algorithm called the Dijkstra Shortest Path First SPF . The SPF algorithm analyzes the link state database. It develops local paths, containing router information, to add to the routing table. Due to the comprehensive view or topology map it offers, OSPF is best for large networks. It rsquo s also suitable for complex networks composed of multiple subnets that simplify network administration and optimize traffic. OSPF can compute and identify the shortest route with minimum network traffic when a network topology change happens. Dynamic routing advantages The advantages of dynamic routing are listed below. Exchange of routing information With dynamic routing, routers can swap routing data when topology adjustments occur. The information exchange empowers routers to learn about new networks automatically and discover substitute paths when connections to current networks fail. Error reduction Dynamic routing helps reduce the chances of committing errors. That rsquo s because it runs path-planning methods mechanically. If you move a network segment, the other routers will accommodate the adjustment. You rsquo ll need to modify the configuration of the router, or routers, connecting the segment that moved. This capability simplifies the adjustment and minimizes the likelihood of mistakes. Scalability Dynamically routed networks can enlarge quickly, with fewer administrative overhead costs. That rsquo s because network topology adjustments require minimal effort. Problem rectification Dynamic routing can correct problems in the network and keep functioning when the network breaks down or the configuration fails. Adaptability Dynamic routing rsquo s adaptability relates closely to its scalability. Whether internetwork grows or fails, the network can learn about the change and adjust accordingly. It can also reroute in response to the modification without any manual intervention. When used with appropriate tools, including a fleet workflow solution , dynamic routing can deliver tangible benefits to your company. These benefits include Real-time tracking for increased productivity. A dynamic route planning platform uses an updated communication and real-time GPS tracking solution . Accessing these features lets you closely track deliveries and the on-road delivery performance of a route. With this visibility, you can maximize your vehicle utilization , streamline delivery distribution, and minimize idle time, resulting in higher productivity. Additional stops per hour. The more delivery stops per hour, the greater the revenue. A dynamic routing software and the best truck GPS navigation for your business can give you efficient delivery paths to increase your stops per hour. Lower operational expenses. By providing optimal delivery paths, dynamic routing platforms help you consume less fuel and reduce overtime pay. The tool can also generate reports on vehicle maintenance, drivers rsquo salaries, fuel costs, IFTA compliance , etc. These documents allow you to review your operational expenses and find ways to minimize costs. Dynamic routing vs. static routing what is the difference? 1. Path selection Dynamic routing offers several available routes to the destination. It considers thousands of real-time factors to choose the most efficient paths. Dynamically routed networks can work with real-time and last-minute plan adjustments in the route, traffic, or weather conditions. Despite these changes, dynamic routing takes into account any cancellations and ad hoc requests and keeps ETAs precise. Static routing uses one preconfigured path to relay traffic to the destination. Your vehicles visit the same location address every time and the prepared route doesn rsquo t change until completion. Static routing doesn rsquo t factor in any modification learned from actual route implementation. You can only update the routes semi-annually or yearly. 2. Routing tables Dynamic routing requires routers to transmit all their routing tables to determine path availability. Static routing has a smaller table with a single entry only for every destination. 3. Algorithms and protocols Dynamic routing uses distance vector protocols and link state protocols to adjust paths. Static routing doesn rsquo t use protocols or complex routing algorithms. 4. Route updating capability Dynamically routed networks use algorithms to update the preferred path adjustment automatically. Static network administrators need to reconfigure static routes manually to modify routes. 5. Bandwidth and computation requirements Dynamic routing entails more calculations and bandwidth to create several route options. Static routing requires less bandwidth and computer power since it only has a single pre-configured path. 6. Security Dynamic routing involves a greater security risk since it distributes complete routing tables throughout the network. Static routing is safer since it doesn rsquo t share paths across the whole network. 7. Use cases Dynamic routing is ideal for more extensive and complex networks with several routers. Its flexibility is suitable for frequently changing network architectures. Static routing is best for smaller networks with fixed network architectures and fewer routers. Static routing can also work well if your logistics company has a definite number of stops. Are there limitations with dynamic routing? Dynamic routing has these limitations Complexity. Dynamic routing is complex to implement initially. When a router adapts to network changes, it must always remove unwanted information from the routing table. This kind of scenario increases the complexity in the routing protocol. Resources. Dynamically routed networks require additional resources, e.g., CPU, memory, or RAM, and link bandwidth, to calculate dynamic routes, hold routing tables, and perform other tasks. Dynamic routing also requires knowledge of supplementary commands. Communication. Some or all machines in a network might not speak any dynamic routing protocol or a common protocol. Bandwidth shortages. Dynamic routers constantly communicate with one another using a dynamic routing protocol to share network topology information. This continuous exchange requires more bandwidth. The messages can also cause bandwidth shortages when routers communicate with a low-speed link, especially in expansive and unstable networks. Security. Dynamic routes pose network security hazards because of the broadcasting and multicasting updates. Routers constantly exchange and advertise or send out complete routing tables and critical information e.g., IP addresses of two routers across the network. Securing dynamic routes requires added configuration settings, such as routing protocol authentication and passive interfaces. Dynamic routing examples Dynamic route planning creates numerous path options unique to the orders to be sent. A route optimization system does so through advanced calculations and algorithms that static routing and manual planning can rsquo t achieve. Here rsquo s a dynamic routing example that demonstrates that capability Suppose your customer needs a package delivered between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. to a location six miles away. The dynamic routing platform rsquo s algorithm can instantly factor in those requirements. It does so while computing the best direction for your drivers. The tool can also consider traffic jams, a driver rsquo s coffee breaks, roadblocks, and last-minute cancellations. Another dynamic routing example is a typical vehicle routing problem involving 10 commercial vehicles and 10 calls per vehicle. To find the optimal delivery path, you have to produce more than 125 quintillion route permutations. Even if you can assess 1,000 choices in a second, it rsquo ll take you nearly 4 billion years to pick the best option. A dynamic route planning software, however, can analyze the problem and present the best delivery paths in minutes.

            "For every fleet manager and operator, safety is a priority. Regardless of the fleet size, the number of drivers, or location, your drivers must have the skills necessary to perform. They also need the right information and tools to help them achieve their best. An advanced driver assistance system ADAS is one of those tools. The first ADAS feature came on the scene in the 1950s in the form of anti-lock brakes . Since then, ADAS technology has advanced a lot. It can help with trickier parking maneuvers, detect upcoming obstacles, detect common driving errors, help drivers safely assess roads, and prevent accidents. What is ADAS and why does it matter? ADAS uses groups of technologies to help drivers engage in complex or difficult maneuvers safely. The most common ADAS features include blind-spot monitoring, lane departure notifications, and collision avoidance alerts. Adaptive cruise control is another. ADAS systems let drivers know if they re driving too closely to a vehicle or an obstacle. It also alerts if other drivers are tailgating. Seeing every potential risk isn t always possible. That s why driver assistance systems use camera-based technologies with loop-recording features. The features continuously record by overwriting older video with new footage to ensure that the device never misses a second of the drive. It gives the driver a second pair of eyes. ADAS solutions pair with your vehicle s AI Dashcam to record live video. The system interprets the incoming data points to analyze what s happening outside of the vehicle in real time. That includes traffic signs, lane changes, common obstacles, oncoming pedestrians, and the behavior of other drivers. What are the benefits of ADAS? We explore the benefits of ADAS below. Safer driving Even the most experienced and responsible drivers can be involved in an accident. That s why installing ADAS in a vehicle is essential. With blind-spot monitoring, collision avoidance, lane departure warnings, and adaptive cruise control, ADAS can reduce front-to-rear crashes by 50 and reverse crashes by 78 . It protects the driver of the ADAS-operated vehicle as well as the other drivers on the road. ADAS also helps individual drivers reduce unsafe behaviors. For fleets that use Motive, video footage from the AI Dashcam is automatically uploaded to the Safety Hub . The footage is used to tailor personalized coaching . The driver can see where they might have been driving unsafely, assess their actions, and make smarter choices the next time they re on the road. Reduced claims By decreasing the chance of accidents, ADAS features can reduce the number of claims. Because ADAS alerts drivers of an impending collision, they re less likely to be involved in an accident. A study by LexisNexis Risk Solutions shows that vehicles fitted with basic ADAS features had a 19 reduction in property damage claims and a 27 reduction in bodily injury claims. Reduced liability On the off chance a driver is involved in an accident, the camera connected to the ADAS will trigger a video recording . This footage can be reviewed by insurance companies or used in legal proceedings to exonerate the driver. If the captured footage proves the fleet driver wasn t at fault, this footage can be used as evidence to avoid third-party liability. Improved vehicle health Driver assistance systems can also help fleet managers assess and maintain the vehicle s overall health. Taking good care of the vehicle can reduce maintenance costs. Because ADAS features help drivers prevent accidents, the features also promote better vehicle maintenance. By notifying you when maintenance is needed, ADAS features help extend the life of your equipment. Technologies like adaptive cruise control ACC allow drivers to monitor their speed. Adaptive cruise control reduces hard acceleration and braking, maintains tire pressure , and reduces fuel consumption. The system also captures data to assess driving patterns of average speed, brake usage, distance of travel, and more. It all helps fleet managers assess how the vehicle is performing. With the Motive Vehicle Gateway , fleet managers can keep a closer eye on vehicle health and prevent maintenance problems. ADAS technologies used by fleets ADAS technologies were initially developed to help professional drivers and promote effective vehicle fleet management . Here s how they do it. Adaptive cruise control ACC detects moving vehicles or stable objects with radar sensors. It warns the driver if they get too close, automatically reducing the speed of the vehicle. Blind spot monitoring connected to the vehicle s cameras shows stable or moving objects from angles the driver might not see. nbsp Lane departure warning LDW pairs video with either laser or infrared sensors to analyze lane markings. The warnings notify the driver if they drift out of the lane. Some advanced versions of this technology will also readjust the vehicle by automatically taking control. Electronic stability control ESC detects when the driver has lost steering control. Electronic stability control typically kicks in after a harsh maneuver or after the driver has applied brakes to prevent the vehicle from spinning off the road. Forward video monitoring records footage of what s happening on the road ahead. It can be used for training purposes or as evidence when an accident takes place. Automatic emergency braking AEB automatically applies the brakes to prevent accidents when a potential collision is detected. Types of driver assistance systems Monitoring systems are paired with vehicle cameras to better assess all angles of the vehicle. They identify harsh braking, potential collisions, and traffic signs. Warning systems like forward collision warning FCW and automatic emergency braking AEB assess how close the vehicle is to other objects. They notify the driver so the driver can act to avoid a collision. Automated systems essentially take control of the vehicle in the event of a crash, usually by automatically applying the brakes. Adaptive systems use motion detectors to assess the distance between vehicles. They adjust the vehicle s speed when necessary. Features to look for in ADAS While most advanced driver assistance systems feature similar technologies, no two are the same. Some will include features to ensure optimum driving safety. Others will only include some basic technologies with the option to add more. At the most basic level, your ADAS will have blind spot detectors, lane departure warnings, and collision alerts. Driver assistance is a slightly higher level of ADAS. In addition to the most basic features, it includes ACC, AEB, and speed limit control. The highest level systems will include more sophisticated features, such as automatic emergency steering and automatic parking assist. How Motive complements your ADAS solution As your partner in accident prevention, our AI Dashcam and Safety Hub assess potential risks on the road. The Motive AI Dashcam instantly detects unsafe driving with unrivaled accuracy and alerts drivers in real time.

            "Among the seemingly too many changes to count, the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a profound shift in consumer buying habits . As physical stores closed either temporarily or for good due to government mandates or consumers rsquo hesitancy to shop in-person, IBM rsquo s U.S. Retail Index noted that the pandemic accelerated the shift away from shopping in brick and mortar stores to digital shopping by about five years. These changes in consumer behavior combined with the acceleration of digital transformation put pressure on the supply chain and especially last-mile delivery mdash a large area of concern for fleet managers due to a number of factors we rsquo ll discuss in-depth in this article. In addition to what last-mile delivery is and why it rsquo s so important, we rsquo ll discuss how to improve last-mile delivery costs and logistics, as well as how emerging technologies can play a big role in your last-mile delivery operations. What is last-mile delivery? Last-mile delivery refers to the final destination in the supply chain, when a product transfers from a business typically a retail store, warehouse, or distribution center to the customer rsquo s business or home. Last-mile delivery might sound simple, but it rsquo s actually the most difficult step of the whole shipping process. From the placement of an order to the successful arrival of the package at its final destination, a lot happens. Last-mile delivery is an important final step in this long chain of events. Why is last-mile tracking so important? Last-mile delivery is a customer-facing process that requires extreme coordination and represents an integral interaction between the buyer and the seller. The rapid growth of the eCommerce industry, accelerated due to the pandemic , has increased demand for flexible, fast, traceable, and personalized last-mile delivery. Customers want to know exactly where their items are, and when exactly they can expect them. If last mile tracking information is incorrect, a product arrives late, is damaged, or is never delivered, there rsquo s a good chance that the customer will shop with a competitor next time. These aspects of last-mile tracking and last-mile delivery are most important to customers Fast delivery Possibly most important of all, customers want speed. Fifty-two percent of customers expect a refund or discount on shipping costs if delivery is delayed. Delivery tracking Delivery tracking is high on the list of consumer demands. It rsquo s a feature that increases convenience. Precise fleet asset tracking is necessary in today rsquo s tech-focused world. Security Throughout this final stage of delivery, customers want their goods to be safe and secure. Security needs to be guaranteed, and insurance should be offered when placing orders to cover any potential mishaps. Convenience Last-mile delivery shouldn rsquo t require any special effort from the consumer. Once the order has been placed, delivery should be a convenient and seamless process that follows. Customers have no desire to put in additional effort to ensure they receive their orders. Specialization Scheduling and routing options are critical. Fifty-five percent of customers need to reschedule appointment windows at least 20 of the time and 70 expect to be able to make some kind of routing change, whether to a new address, terminal, or pickup locker. Cost of delivery Sixty-two percent of customers cite cost as the most important factor in delivery. Understanding last-mile delivery costs Last-mile delivery problems are the most expensive part of the supply chain, accounting for 40-50 of total shipping costs. The total shipping costs add up for delivery organizations when you think of everything that goes into these deliveries people, vehicles, and management. A number of factors contribute to last-mile delivery costs, including Fuel costs Fuel costs have a huge impact on the price of a truckload. Higher prices and fuel shortages are the second largest operating cost on average behind the truck driver. Idling and downtime There rsquo s a lot of idling when drivers are driving and dropping off goods in cities. Drivers are dealing with other vehicles, traffic, and winding streets on a daily basis. A delivery truck, on average, uses around 0.8 gallons of fuel per hour when idling , which can add up quickly. Out-of-route miles Drivers tend to lose track of their dispatchers rsquo route plans given the high number of individual stops they make, especially if those routes aren rsquo t easy to refer back to. Unfortunately for shippers, a study shows that out-of-route miles usually account for 10 of the overall delivery fleet rsquo s mileage. Warehousing The amount of space, storage characteristics, geographic location, and total number of locations can impact the cost. Failed deliveries Companies that distribute goods to supply chain partners or delivery hubs don rsquo t have to deal with failed deliveries. In contrast, businesses that deliver to the end consumer are grappling with the problem of failed deliveries every day. Even a single digit percentage of failed deliveries and the industry average is around 5 can add up to considerable costs quite rapidly. How to improve last-mile logistics The focus of last-mile logistics is to deliver items to the end consumer as fast as possible. While it seems simple enough, the last mile is an expensive mile. The following tips can help you improve last-mile logistics and cut costs. Use route planning A poorly planned final delivery will never reach its destination on time. But with a good route optimization solution , last-mile deliveries can be done faster than usual. The delivery routes are optimized considering the traffic, road conditions, distance, vehicle type, and vehicle capacity. Consider requiring proof of delivery Proof of delivery verifies that the delivery has been made successfully. Drivers can easily finish capturing proof of delivery and add it to their daily report of deliveries. It removes any confusion and can prevent or reduce the number of false claims. Analyze your reports Daily reporting of deliveries can help companies understand how deliveries are being carried out. By analyzing reports, businesses can identify weaknesses and create opportunities for improvements in the last mile. Motive can help monitor key metrics while filtering out data by drivers, date, or route. Understand the importance of customer experience By properly planning for last-mile logistics, you can keep your customers happy. Making meaningful improvements to your customer communications requires going beyond providing customers with a static tracking number. Make the last mile options flexible, allowing the customer to customize the experience to best suit their needs. Use dispatching software Last-mile delivery software simplifies managing, dispatching, and optimizing last-mile delivery logistics. When using a real-time fleet tracking solution , you rsquo ll see predictive arrival times, have a real-time view of driver locations, and be able to better plan routes and assign new deliveries to drivers as they come in. How to use Motive to solve last-mile delivery challenges Motive rsquo s comprehensive fleet workflow solution is proven to save time and money, two crucial factors in having the most efficient last-mile delivery as possible.

            "Big business can be a complicated business. For enterprise fleets, the last few years have served as a potent reminder of that. Increased demand created a backlog of goods at the largest U.S. ports . And a lack of personnel to move freight further complicated matters. Especially a shortage of truck drivers that stands at 78,000, according to the American Trucking Associations ATA . The larger your business becomes, the easier it is to lose sight of the small-business mindset that brought your first taste of success. And yet the steps you took in your company rsquo s earliest days can still work. Enterprise fleets like PS Logistics are rediscovering the wisdom of ldquo thinking small to go big. rdquo Along the way, they rsquo re becoming more strategic, emphasizing the personal, and tightening their focus. By following the tips below, you can too. 1. Establish a ldquo small village rdquo culture With 3,700 employees across 13 companies, PS Logistics has been described as ldquo a bustling city rdquo with organized neighborhoods that allow for personalization at scale. As big as PS Logistics has become, the company has maintained its neighborhood feel. It s a quality that has strengthened work relationships and enhanced driver satisfaction. ldquo Maintaining a small village culture has been a major focus at PS Logistics as we have grown and tried to maintain a sense of what made us attractive when we were smaller, rdquo says Kim Daigle, VP of Human Resources at PS Logistics, based in Ensley, Alabama. ldquo Starting out, driver managers could talk to the president of the company and see if we could improve the situation for a specific driver, rdquo Daigle says. ldquo As we grew, we couldn rsquo t have everyone walking into the president rsquo s office anymore, so we empowered driver managers to make decisions. The move allowed mid-level managers to address drivers rsquo concerns as they arose instead of allowing problems to fester. ldquo Timely communication helped to resolve issues quickly and establish trust, rdquo Daigle says. Simulating the feel of a small village isn rsquo t easy for large fleets. Managers can make the mistake of thinking more about the vehicle than driver well-being. ldquo They almost make the person into a piece of equipment, rdquo Daigle says. ldquo It happens when large companies try to allocate more drivers to fewer managers. You can solve that problem by keeping the driver-to-manager ratio low. By keeping that ratio low, each manager is able to think of the individuals that he or she is managing instead of vehicle numbers. rdquo 2. Focus on people, not problems People management is one of the most important fleet manager responsibilities . Small fleets tend to have a family atmosphere where coworkers know each other well. But a close-knit vibe doesn rsquo t have to be exclusive to small fleets. By maintaining or reproducing that supportive, cohesive vibe, large fleets can maintain the personal touch that first made them special. The key, says Allison Wiers, leader of marketing and retention at Dutch Maid Logistics , is access. With about 240 employees at the mid-sized fleet, Dutch Maid workers have frequent access to one another. The result is an invested workforce. ldquo Here at Dutch Maid, we were able to see each other face-to-face during the pandemic, rdquo Wiers says. ldquo Managers and drivers were able to have in-person conversations in the yard. At our size, our company president is able to call everyone who works here on their birthday. So I think access is a big factor in keeping it personal and allowing for one-on-one communication . rdquo 3. Communicate frequently and positively Breakdowns in communication can break relationships, putting workers at risk of leaving. Keeping the lines of communication open is pivotal to retention. WorkHound , a feedback platform for the frontline workforce, recently released a report on How to Disrupt Turnover . The report found that disengaged workers made 178 more comments about communication than their satisfied peers did. ldquo We know that poor communication can quickly lead to at-risk workers, and that at-risk workers regularly voice their concerns about ineffective or incomplete communication, rdquo says WorkHound Co-founder and CEO Max Farrell. ldquo That rsquo s why making multiple touchpoints with your team each week is a valuable retention tactic. rdquo While disengaged drivers say a lack of communication makes them feel unappreciated, the most invested drivers say they feel informed and connected . The WorkHound report showed that drivers at small and medium-sized fleets made 50 more praise comments than those at large fleets did, and that 30 of all praise was about people. ldquo The substantial lack of praise at large companies is probably a symptom of poor communication, rdquo Farrell observes. ldquo At small fleets, drivers are accustomed to more frequent communication. Drivers at companies of all sizes may benefit from being contacted more often, not only when something goes wrong. rdquo 4. Make sure drivers understand how and when they rsquo ll be paid Establishing clarity about driver pay from the start sends a strong signal that your company is transparent and values driver satisfaction. About 40 of all WorkHound pay data shows that drivers don rsquo t understand their pay or are paid incorrectly. ldquo Reviewing pay and pay frequency early in onboarding is a sign of trust-building, rdquo Farrell explains. ldquo It shows that the company is trying to get an employee rsquo s pay correct from the very beginning. rdquo Managers at PS Logistics address pay during a driver rsquo s first week. ldquo It may be as simple as lsquo Let rsquo s go over your settlement and make sure you understand what you rsquo re being paid for and how you rsquo re being paid, rsquo rdquo Daigle says. ldquo After a few weeks, managers and drivers review the pay process again, because not everything is going to sink in after the first week. rdquo According to a report by the popular HR company Workday , disengaged employees start showing declining engagement and loyalty nine months before they leave a company. A lack of communication about pay can inspire employees to leave. ldquo Even when employees feel they rsquo re appropriately rewarded, the inability to talk openly about pay with their managers can cause employees to disengage and become more likely to quit, the report states. This suggests that the ability to have discussions with a manager about rewards ties into an employee rsquo s sense of self-worth. It supports their sense that the company respects them. rdquo 5. Treat drivers like customers Too often, businesses focus on customer satisfaction at the expense of employee satisfaction. Treating drivers like customers is an effective business strategy. One that can strengthen driver retention and company loyalty. In the Forbes article ldquo Treating Employees Like Customers Why It rsquo s Your Best Performance Strategy , rdquo writer Heather V. MacArthur recommends training managers to provide great employee service just as they learn to provide great customer service. Holding managers accountable for how they lead, and making sure they rsquo re comfortable receiving feedback, ldquo sends a strong message that all employees matter, rdquo MacArthur writes.

            "On Monday, March 7, the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators CCMTA announced that the education and awareness phase of electronic logging device ELD enforcement in Canada has been extended. For all jurisdictions, the new Canadian ELD mandate date for enforcement is January 1, 2023. While a province-by-province approach to ELD enforcement was initially expected, the Transport Ministers in Canada opted for a nationwide delay. Especially considering that British Columbia, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland had been slow to adopt rules around ELD compliance. The extended ELD enforcement deadline gives Canadian fleets until January 1, 2023 to buy and install certified ELD devices and conduct training on how to use them. Carriers can prepare for the ELD mandate by researching ELD device options and ensuring that their ELDs have been certified by Transport Canada. Approved devices can be found here as they become certified. The Motive electronic logging device ELD is fully certified on Android and iOS for the Canadian ELD mandate. Our reliable, easy-to-use ELD has helped fleets stay compliant in Canada and in the U.S. since 2017. Because Motive is a certified vendor for the Canadian ELD market, our customers can continue to operate confidently knowing they rsquo re meeting their compliance obligations on both sides of the border. Experts recommend that fleets adopt ELD technology as soon as possible to help avoid violations and operational disruptions. Non-compliant drivers will be subject to fines, out-of-service orders, and potential criminal citations during roadside inspections. Non-compliant carriers will be subject to enhanced enforcement scrutiny and possible safety rating downgrades. To avoid service disruptions, it rsquo s crucial to implement an approved ELD well before the new January 1, 2023 enforcement deadline. As Motive customers in Canada work toward full compliance with the ELD mandate, they can count on our support and technology for help in meeting their ELD obligations. Tips to help you prepare for enforcement Complying with the Canadian ELD mandate goes beyond buying and installing an ELD. The most successful fleets also spend time familiarizing themselves with the new compliance workflows. Here are two simple steps to help you prepare for a smooth transition. 1. Train your team early The best way to prepare for the upcoming Canadian ELD mandate date is to adopt ELD technology in advance, then train your drivers and back-office staff on how to use it. Show your team how to log Hours of Service HOS , avoid violations, and toggle between Canadian and U.S. rules. To practice using Canadian-specific functionality, customers can download our highly-rated Driver App on Google Play or the Apple App Store. Get comfortable with features such as deferral of hours, yard move and personal conveyance limits, and Alberta cycle rules.

            "Driver safety is a top priority for any small business or commercial fleet. Employers pay 60 billion annually for motor vehicle crashes involving their employees. Beyond costs, preventing unsafe driving can save lives and protect your drivers, business, and reputation. This article explores the value of live stream dash cam technology in maximizing road safety. What is a live stream dash cam? A dash cam is a compact video camera that can attach to a vehicle dashboard, the inside of the windshield, a rearview mirror, or nearby surface. A live streaming feature provides real-time footage of what rsquo s happening in the cab, on the road, or both at once. Safety managers can conduct virtual ride-alongs with drivers and help coach remotely to improve safety on the road. How does live streaming work? Authorized administrators can use live streaming to get an ongoing view from a remote location. With the driver rsquo s permission and awareness. Live streaming dash cams may offer Audio recording Built-in GPS tracking HD or high-res image capture Night vision Accident motion sensors You rsquo ll likely also be choosing between a road-facing or dual-facing camera . The most common may be road-facing, but there are added benefits of dual-facing cameras to help coach and protect drivers. Benefits of live streaming Live streaming is generally an optional feature for dash cams. Here are several advantages of getting real-time visibility into driver safety on the road. 1. Remote training You can rsquo t send safety managers out on the road with every driver. Yet with live streaming, veteran drivers and safety personnel can quickly check in on drivers for a spot check. This lets you randomly sample your fleet drivers or focus on individual drivers who need customized coaching. Managers can also conduct virtual ride-alongs to onboard new drivers and provide remote training in real time. 2. Peace of mind Managers gain the ability to check in on drivers to make sure they rsquo re safe in challenging weather or other conditions. The live streaming enables a veteran driver or fleet safety manager to help troubleshoot and monitor performance on the road. 3. Improved customer experience Live streaming can help fleet managers verify proof of delivery. The ability to view what rsquo s happening, live, at loading docks can improve communication with your customers and enhance accountability. How does live streaming affect driver privacy? Privacy is a top concern for drivers with live streaming in their cabs. You don rsquo t want to sacrifice your employee rsquo s peace of mind by making them feel as if they rsquo re constantly surveilled by the prying eye of the camera. That rsquo s why top dash cams with live streaming technology are built with driver privacy in mind. Like the Motive AI Dashcam. This optional feature must be turned on by a fleet admin to use. Motive rsquo s AI Dashcam always lets the driver know through in-cab audio and visual alerts when the live stream starts and ends. Only users with live streaming permissions can initiate a live stream, and the vehicle must have the feature enabled for managers to live stream. Besides live streaming, what are the other benefits of an AI Dashcam? 1. Prevent accidents Motive s advanced AI Dashcam includes powerful AI processors and advanced computer vision algorithms that detect unsafe driving with unparalleled accuracy. The Motive AI Dashcam instantly detects unsafe driving behaviors such as cell phone distraction and close following with industry-leading accuracy and alerts drivers in real time. 2. Gain a coaching tool You have a lot of drivers on the road. That can mean a large volume of dash cam video. Motive rsquo s event intelligence and in-house safety team analyze every video for you within seconds to determine the context and severity. Managers get prioritized videos with rich data to help them make informed decisions, and drivers are automatically coached on correctable behaviors when they complete their trip. Using Motive rsquo s DRIVE proprietary risk scoring, you can pinpoint your fleet rsquo s high-risk drivers, and follow a prebuilt coaching framework to engage drivers in experiential learning. Using footage showing everything before, during, and after a safety event can provide a clear case study of driver decisions behind the wheel. Following the preventative measures suggested by our AI Dashcam technology, drivers can also improve their CSA scores , which makes them more desirable and employable. 3. Protect against false claims With dashboard camera footage, drivers can gather evidence of what rsquo s actually happening on the road. If an accident does occur, the fleet has video evidence in the event of a claim against a driver. This can prevent false claims and help reduce claim costs in the event of an actual event. In fact, many insurance companies recognize the advantages of dash cam technology and offer discounts when they rsquo re installed in commercial vehicles. Using live stream dash cams sends a clear signal to your insurer that you rsquo re serious about safety. 4. Cut costs Dash cam footage provides digital proof of what happened on the road. With the ability to search and save the footage of any incident or event, you can avoid steep attorney fees long, drawn out court cases and extensive insurance investigations. With our AI Dashcam alerting drivers of dangerous driving behaviors, the number of traffic citations can drop as well. That means lower out-of-pocket costs for your drivers as well as fewer points against their licenses. Meanwhile, fleet managers will enjoy greater scheduling ease with fewer drivers dealing with suspension and or higher insurance premiums. At the same time, in the event of an insurance claim, dash cams can expedite the processing speed of the settlement. 5. Support safety culture With dash cams installed in your vehicles, your business emphasizes to employees the importance of a safety culture . You re following vehicle fleet management best practices by prioritizing safety for everyone. Emphasize the positive. Use recordings from the live stream dash cams to identify good driving habits too. Some businesses use the footage and driver report cards to recognize those who put road safety first. Request a demo to see what the Motive AI Dashcam can do Pairing live stream dash cams with a f leet safety program can cut risks, reduce costs, and improve your overall compliance and business reliability.

            "Fleet managers, along with a variety of companies that deliver goods and provide services, and even the everyday driver uses GPS to know where they rsquo re going. For fleet managers, GPS provides the added benefit of knowing where their vehicles are at any moment, resulting in significant cost savings, safer vehicle utilization, and on-time arrivals and deliveries. In this guide, we rsquo ll take a closer look at the ways GPS fleet tracking can benefit an organization. But first hellip What is fleet tracking? Fleet tracking is a management system that uses GPS tracking to monitor assets and fleet vehicle locations and activities. GPS fleet tracking uses cellular and satellite technology, allowing fleet managers to locate vehicles and assets in real time. For example, tracking systems can show how long drivers stay at loading docks before moving to the next stops during the trip. If the duration is too long, you can find ways to make their pickups more efficient. In this way, they can shorten their loading time and boost their daily productivity. With GPS fleet tracking , you get the most accurate data on vehicle movements and locations, estimating fuel consumption and emissions levels, time spent on site, and equipment usage. GPS delivers fleet managers the data needed to make strategic decisions and to increase asset and vehicle return on investment ROI . How GPS fleet tracking works A GPS fleet tracker attached to your commercial vehicle connects to a group of satellites to identify the vehicle rsquo s location. nbsp The tracker applies a trilateration process that uses the position of at least three satellites from the global navigation satellite system GNSS network and the tracker rsquo s distance from them. nbsp From trilateration, the GPS tracker identifies the vehicle rsquo s latitude and longitude coordinates including time and elevation and emits a signal with the data in real time. A wireless carrier tower picks up the signal and the transmitted coordinates and relays them to a cloud server. If you use fleet tracking or management software, you can connect to that cloud server and obtain real-time GPS data about your vehicle rsquo s location. The benefits of GPS fleet tracking GPS fleet tracking may have started out as a way to keep drivers from getting lost, but it provides many valuable benefits to companies that have a fleet of vehicles on the road. nbsp Other benefits of GPS fleet tracking are Location alerts To determine where all of a company rsquo s drivers, vehicles, and assets are at any given moment, all a fleet manager needs to do is look at their computer. This eliminates unnecessary guessing or time-consuming phone calls and lets fleet managers view their assets rsquo location in real time. Fleet managers can also inform customers of delivery times almost down to the minute, which means happier and satisfied clients and repeat customers. Route planning and analysis GPS fleet tracking also helps in route planning. Routes often change due to road maintenance or severe weather conditions. With GPS fleet tracking, managers can view and analyze various routes to determine the quickest and best possible path to take. Information transparency and real-time communication The real-time information gathered from a GPS fleet tracking system can be shared with customers and internal staff, ensuring total visibility into where any vehicle is located. Using GPS location, dispatchers can inform customers when the driver will arrive. This can be done without placing the driver in the dangerous position of having to use their cell phone or radio while behind the wheel. Types of GPS fleet tracking GPS fleet tracking systems generally have two main types active and passive. Active GPS tracking Active GPS trackers send real-time location data to a cloud server, relying on constant connection for continuous location monitoring and seamless fleet tracking management. Active GPS trackers process and send real-time data, giving fleet managers visibility into vehicle movements and locations and delivering alerts anytime and anywhere. Passive GPS tracking Passive GPS trackers store data at intervals or when trigger events occur, such as when the vehicle reaches the location, crosses a geofence , or detects pre-programmed actions. Passive trackers then send the gathered data to the server for analysis. Since this GPS tracking type doesn rsquo t rely on a constant connection, data collection is generally performed through manual downloads following fleet operations. Most modern fleet tracking devices use a mix of active and passive tracking activities. This includes routine and immediate data uploading in real time and storing and sending data at a later time. Combined active and passive tracking capabilities are useful, especially when vehicles pass through remote areas with limited or no satellite and cellular networks since data updates can resume when the connection returns. Companies that use GPS fleet tracking GPS technology plays a crucial role in commercial fleet vehicle tracking and management in a variety of companies and organizations. Delivery fleets Delivery companies use GPS fleet tracking to monitor vehicle movement and location and ensure on-time, seamless delivery services. These companies check whether their vehicles are constantly moving and taking the recommended route. They ensure their drivers move at efficient speeds and can deliver customer orders by the promised arrival time. If the vehicles get stuck somewhere, delivery companies can verify from GPS data the location of the vehicle. Delivery services also use GPS tracking to share relevant data with their customers. This information includes the delivery vehicles rsquo real-time location and the packages rsquo estimated time of arrival ETA . Accessing these details allows customers to track orders and expect to receive them on schedule. GPS tracking systems can even notify managers when their commercial driver has completed delivery and can receive new or further instructions, return to the distribution center or store , or sign off. Passenger transit companies taxis, limousines, car services, etc. Passenger transit companies use a global system for mobile communications GSM and GPS tracking to allow fleet managers to dispatch commercial drivers more efficiently. GSM and GPS make it quick and easy for the closest drivers to get to the client pickup point, significantly reducing wait times and guaranteeing improved customer satisfaction. You can also program the GSM and GPS to alert fleet managers when vehicle doors open and close to indicate completed fares and available cabs. Using mobile devices with GPS also helps passenger transit drivers by streamlining the transaction process and displaying the route, location, traffic conditions, and price for the journey. Bus fleets Bus companies use GPS fleet tracking systems for accurate location announcements at bus stops and route planning. GPS fleet tracking provides data on the vehicle rsquo s exact location and speed. The system will then cross-reference this information with traffic updates to accurately estimate each vehicle rsquo s arrival time at every bus stop. This helps streamline fleet tracking management while also delivering timely transport services to passengers. Construction fleets Virtually any industry can benefit from GPS tracking, but those in the construction industry, in particular, are reaping substantial results. The theft of vehicles, property, and materials is a frequent occurrence in construction. Since most construction areas are expansive, building materials, tools, and even heavy equipment can rsquo t be monitored and watched closely 24 7, resulting in theft and loss. But with GPS tracking, construction superintendents are guaranteed real-time monitoring of everything on-site. Using geofencing , a specific job site perimeter can be programmed, allowing companies to set up a virtual boundary around their construction site. When anything with a GPS tracking device leaves that perimeter, it instantly notifies the fleet manager, safety manager, or a member of the back-office staff. Integrate GPS fleet tracking in your commercial fleet Using GPS fleet tracking can increase your productivity, enable your drivers and fleet managers to collaborate better, and deliver a better experience to your customers.\n",

            "Your on-time delivery performance can have a huge impact on the success of your business. When goods arrive at your customer rsquo s door in good condition and on time, or, better yet, earlier, you rsquo ve gained a satisfied customer. A happy customer is a repeat customer who will help your business get more referrals and new business opportunities. On the other hand, damaged goods or exceptionally late delivery can lose customers and hurt your brand. To stay on top of your delivery performance, track your operations with on-time delivery metrics. Use them to uncover logistical issues and optimize your operational efficiency. In this blog, you can learn how. Let rsquo s start with the basics. What does on-time delivery mean? On-time delivery OTD means delivering goods on or before the agreed-upon time. It refers to your company rsquo s ability to meet clients rsquo deadlines and transport loads in a timely manner. Commercial fleets can achieve OTD with proper fleet asset management . What are on-time delivery metrics? On-time delivery metrics are the measurement of how many loads are delivered on time. On-time delivery metrics are crucial when it comes to measuring your fleet rsquo s efficiency . These quantitative data points reflect your capability to fulfill customer orders without delays. These on-time delivery metrics also help you monitor the accuracy of your time estimations and assess your logistical efficiency and operational performance. Factors that make measuring on-time delivery difficult include Volume of ordered goods. If you deliver 90 of the 100 ordered items, and the customers acknowledge the deficit, will this count as an OTD delivery? If you ship 80 products on time, and the end user allows receiving the remaining goods on a later schedule, will this be a 100 or 90 on-time delivery? Delivery date. Let rsquo s say customers expect a package on May 29 and agree to receive the goods three days before, but also allow some leeway to accept the items three days after the promised date. If the items arrive within the six-day window, will you consider this an on-time delivery? Quantity of goods in the order. If customers purchase five different items in the same order, should you transport all five goods on schedule to obtain a 100 OTD delivery? Delivery metrics can vary in terminologies, measurement methods, and variables from one company to the next. That rsquo s why industry players need to define and agree on the standards and definition of ldquo on time. rdquo Business owners and logistics companies can indicate these in their contracts, agreements, terms, and conditions. On-time delivery performance example On-time delivery metrics typically refer to a range of dates rather than specific ones. Most companies express them as X days before and Y days after the due date. A conventional OTD delivery window is five days earlier and zero days late. Suppose a product is due to be delivered on September 1. You can deem the delivery on time if it reaches the end destination between August 27 and September 1. If it arrives beyond the first of September, the shipment will be considered late. Is there an on-time delivery formula? You can calculate the timeliness of a customer rsquo s delivery with a basic on-time delivery KPI formula OTD Number of items delivered on time Total number of deliveries 100 This calculation for the OTD delivery results in a percentage. For example, if you successfully delivered 15 of 20 total shipments on schedule, your OTD would be 75 . The wrong way to make an on-time delivery calculation At its core, the on-time delivery KPI is meant to ensure you do what you said you rsquo d do. If a school ordered 50 laptops for teachers and you were able to ship 47 of them on time, you shouldn rsquo t give yourself a score of 94 . Instead, you should record an on-time KPI score of 0 , because you failed to ship all of the laptops on time. Getting a 94 rating shows as if you did exceptional service and your customers didn rsquo t encounter any difficulties. In reality, three teachers didn rsquo t receive their laptops on time,. It translates to hundreds of students having a less than stellar learning experience. When you manipulate your on-time delivery computations by focusing on quantities, you ignore the negative impact on your customers. How do you improve on-time delivery metrics and KPIs? Below are tips to improve your on-time delivery KPI and metrics. Set international OTD delivery goals. Use scorecards to measure and track your performance and reward drivers who reach the targets consistently. Listen to your drivers to uncover the causes of delays and bottlenecks. Ask them for recommendations on route planning improvements to incorporate into your fleet management plan . Establish clear communication lines with your suppliers, customers, and other parties involved. Agree on any mutually applicable KPIs and definitions and understand one another rsquo s workflows. Ensure that you can quickly contact each party in case of emergencies or the need to modify plans. Leverage technology to boost the efficiency of your shipment and delivery workflows. This includes automating and updating materials with RFID scanners and conveyors. Software for route management and package monitoring can optimize processes and eliminate time-consuming steps.

            "As a commercial fleet driver, you want to be out on the road making trips and doing your job. Having to prepare for the Department of Transportation DOT physical exam can feel like an unwanted distraction. That rsquo s why we rsquo ve pulled together all the information you need to know in this guide to the basics of the DOT physical exam. What is the DOT physical exam? Commercial driver medical exams are required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA . The DOT physical exam is described to medical professionals doing the testing as ldquo a critical element of the FMCSA safety program hellip focused on reducing crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks and buses. rdquo According to the FMCSA, ldquo approximately 6 to 7 million commercial motor vehicle CMV drivers are required by law to comply with FMCSA physical qualification standards. rdquo That means certified medical examiners are performing more than 3 million physical examinations annually. Who needs a DOT medical exam? The DOT physical exam is mandatory for drivers who operate vehicles that Have a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or more and are engaged in interstate commerce Carry hazardous materials HAZMAT Are capable of carrying more than 15 occupants, or eight occupants if the driver is a paid employee What do doctors check for during the DOT physical exam? The aim of the exam is to determine a driver rsquo s medical fitness for duty. The medical examiner is aware of stressful scenarios for commercial drivers, including the type of route, work schedule, environment, and cargo. With these in mind, the medical professional is looking to determine that a driver can successfully Stay alert when driving Control the steering wheel Use side mirrors Manipulate dashboard switches and controls Shift gears Enter and exit the vehicle Couple and uncouple trailers Load, secure, and unload cargo Perform vehicle checks The examiner rsquo s role is to determine ldquo acceptable risk. rdquo As the FMCSA puts it, the examiner rsquo s ldquo fundamental obligation during the physical assessment is to establish whether a driver has a disease or disorder that interferes with the ability to safely operate a CMV, increases the risk for sudden death, or increases the risk for the onset of gradual or sudden incapacitation, thus endangering public safety. rdquo What does the DOT physical exam consist of? To understand how to pass the DOT physical exam, you rsquo ll need to know, specifically, what it involves. A health history You rsquo ll be asked to complete a health history form. If you answer ldquo yes rdquo to any of the questions, the examiner will follow up. The examiner will ask about diagnosis, treatment, and response to treatment. They rsquo ll review and discuss any medications you currently use, or recently used. And they rsquo ll go over potential side effects that may interfere with driving. A vision test To pass the vision test, a driver must demonstrate Visual acuity of at least 20 40 Snellen in each eye, with or without corrective lenses Field of vision of at least 70 degrees in the horizontal meridian in each eye The ability to recognize and distinguish the colors of traffic signals A hearing test Drivers are required to be able to perceive a forced, whispered voice in one ear at no less than five feet. Or, they must not have an average hearing loss in one ear greater than 40 decibels dB at 500 hertz Hz , 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz. This requires drivers to complete one of the tests in one ear only. A blood pressure and pulse rate test You get this done every time you see a medical professional. With the DOT physical exam, this test can impact the term of the certification. The examiner might only grant a one-time, three-month medical certificate if the recorded blood pressure BP rate indicates a certain level of hypertension. A Urinalysis test Testing for controlled substances isn rsquo t part of the DOT physical exam. This urinalysis test is looking at the drivers rsquo specific gravity, protein, blood, and glucose levels. A physical exam Finally, you rsquo ll also need to complete a DOT medical exam. In this physical exam, the medical professional looks to see if the driver has any issues that might cause them to be compromised by fatigue or sudden, incapacitating symptoms. The test confirms you can perform vigorous activity. It also confirms that you have sufficient grip strength, upper and lower body strength, balance, flexibility, and range of motion. The DOT physical exam also checks that drivers have adequate reach and touch sensation in hands and fingers. How often do you have to get a DOT physical? How often are DOT physicals required? That depends on your certification. The medical examiner can certify a driver for a maximum of two years. They can also certify a driver for a shorter period of time if more frequent monitoring is required to ensure fitness for duty. It rsquo s up to the driver to maintain a current medical certification and carry their Medical Examiner rsquo s Certificate while operating a CMV. How much is a DOT medical exam? The DOT physical cost varies across the country. According to MD Save, the estimated national average is 226. Are there exemptions from the DOT medical exam? Drivers that can rsquo t meet the DOT medical requirements regarding physical impairment, vision, hearing, or diabetes can apply for exemptions to keep driving. A driver might decide to drive intrastate only in states where the standards are less stringent. How to schedule a DOT physical exam near you To complete any components of the exam, do a quick online search for ldquo DOT physical near me. rdquo You rsquo ll get many results close to your search location and be able to conveniently call or book online. Keep in mind, only certified medical examiners found on the FMCSA rsquo s National Registry can perform DOT physicals. However, drivers who are military veterans can have the exam done by a qualified physician through the Veteran rsquo s Administration. What rsquo s included on a DOT medical card? The DOT medical card is proof that you rsquo ve been found physically capable of safely operating a commercial vehicle. Also known as a Medical Examiner rsquo s Certificate MEC , it rsquo s not an actual card. It rsquo s the many pages of documentation that record medical history, vital signs, and results of the physical tests.

            "If you run a fleet of commercial vehicles and are considering integrating vehicle tracking systems into your operations, then this guide is for you. What is vehicle GPS tracking? GPS tracking involves a network of satellites that triangulate a trackable device rsquo s location, movement, and speed. These trackable devices are installed in vehicles or can be held in your hand like a cellphone. GPS was originally developed for military use. It rsquo s been a standard feature in many car models since the late 1980s. Commercial fleets use GPS tracking systems to maintain accurate information about where their assets are at all times. Learn more about GPS fleet tracking technology . Why invest in commercial vehicle tracking GPS tracking technology helps simplify and improve fleet operations. Instead of having to call drivers to ask for their location, dispatchers can check their online dashboards to view the information in real time. This helps dispatchers spend less time on the phone. Drivers can focus on the road. Fleets use GPS tracking to Plan efficient truck routes nbsp Streamline employee schedules Reduce time spent looking for assets Monitor driver behavior and provide incident-specific coaching Provide better customer service with accurate and timely information Optimize routes to reduce time to destination Recover assets after theft Increase safety and lower costs GPS tracking systems can help fleets operate more safely. GPS monitors the speeds at which vehicles are traveling. It does it from any remote location by tracking a driver rsquo s rate of acceleration and deceleration or how quickly a driver passes through intersections. The fleet manager can use that data to reward drivers who drive safely or coach drivers who don rsquo t. High-performing drivers trigger fewer risky events. That means they rsquo re less likely to be involved in collisions and earn written violations. A GPS tracker can help improve your productivity. It can also help you make informed business decisions. In knowing where your assets are, you can ensure your trucks spend less time idling. GPS tracking systems also have geofencing features. Geofencing features can alert you when fleet vehicles leave a predetermined geographic area. Once you set up the virtual borders of your geofence, you can see in real-time when one of your assets enters or leaves the boundary. The information can increase your fleet rsquo s efficiency . Once you know it rsquo s about to enter your location, you can send an asset back out on a job or to scheduled maintenance. GPS tracking improves route efficiency GPS tracking systems help uncover when and where vehicles experience long detention times . Through geofencing and detention time reporting, Flying Star Transport improved its efficiency by as much as 15 . After implementing GPS tracking on all of its assets, CFO Jayson Boydstun reported that the company rsquo s average of five hours per load dropped to about four hours. GPS tracking can solve common problems Problem Inaccurate Field Information Fleet managers need to know where their assets are, how long they rsquo re in operation, and where they rsquo re heading. Problem is, information is often sent late. Other times, it rsquo s inaccurate. Especially when drivers are relaying information over the phone. Solution GPS truck tracking has a much higher level of accuracy. It tells the exact location of your vehicles and their status. It does it in real time. Problem Lack of Accountability A recent study conducted by Intuit reported that regardless of their clients rsquo industries, 92 suffer from ldquo time theft. rdquo Time theft happens when employees don rsquo t clock out during unpaid breaks. nbsp Solution By tracking vehicle location and status, GPS tracking helps hold employees accountable for unsupervised time on the job. nbsp Problem Lack of Revenue Growth Without a reliable way of tracking the location and availability of your vehicles, you won rsquo t be able to maximize your fleet rsquo s capacity to generate revenue. Solution GPS tracking allows you to view the status of your vehicles remotely. It can show idling vehicles so you can put them to work. Learn more about GPS Fleet Tracking solutions from Motive How do vehicle tracking systems support enterprise companies? GPS fleet tracking has many benefits , such as. Improved visibility into your operations By using GPS tracking and telematics , you get access to data that shows whether you rsquo re under- or over-resourced. Data can show how much you rsquo re paying on tolls and violations. If you rsquo re part of a construction company, it can show where your equipment is, and if it rsquo s working or idle. With this information, you can plan better, make decisions more quickly, and reduce cargo theft. A supply chain risk trend analysis revealed 289 recorded thefts in the first quarter of 2021. Each incident was worth about 142,574. GPS tracking is a powerful tool to prevent cargo theft. GPS tracks your assets and pinpoints their locations in real time. GPS tracking also helps you identify hot spots for cargo theft in your region and plan routes better. Fleets can use geofencing to create virtual fences around assets, then receive alerts when an asset crosses that border. Improved fuel efficiency Fleets can save money by optimizing fuel use. Since fuel consumption is one of the biggest expenses for a fleet, improving fuel efficiency can significantly impact your company rsquo s bottom line. Below are tried and tested fuel-saving tips that fleet managers use Integrate fleet management software into operations. Conduct route optimization. Ensure the tires are properly inflated. Minimizing poor driving habits Apart from idling, poor driving habits, such as speeding, hard braking, and hard cornering, can waste fuel. They rsquo re also a potential safety risk. GPS tracking combined with reliable fleet management software can help you identify poor driving habits. Reduced driver detention time Driver detention at receivers and shippers can cost up to 1,280 per driver per year . GPS tracking can play a crucial role in reducing driver detention time and improving overall efficiency. One example is monitoring the vehicle rsquo s exact location via GPS. You can get a reasonably accurate ETA and let shippers and receivers know location in advance, which may help reduce detention time. Flying Star Transport increased its efficiency by up to 15 with Motive rsquo s geofencing solution. ldquo We have gone from roughly five hours per load on a 130-mile haul last year, to running about four hours per load on a 120-mile haul this year rdquo says Boydstun. Improved customer service with geofencing Great customer service is the key to repeat customers and sustainable growth. With geofencing and GPS tracking, it rsquo s possible for fleets of all types and sizes to provide timely ETAs and improve the customer experience.

            "On December 18, 2017, the electronic logging device ELD mandate will take effect. Although most fleets are prepared for the upcoming ELD rule, some of them still have questions. To answer some of those questions, a panel discussion was held at the American Trucking Associations ATA Management Conference amp Exhibition MC amp E 2017. The panel highlighted an important aspect of the ELD mandate. Many truckers assume that the ELD mandate is changing the hours-of-service rules and regulations. That rsquo s not true. The ELD mandate is only going to enforce the Hours-of-Service rules that already have been in place. According to the panel, the new ELD mandate will not change the current hours-of-service HOS rules. It will, however, affect the way these rules will be monitored and enforced. Joe DeLorenzo, Office Compliance and Enforcement Director at the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA , clarified that the ELD mandate is focused on HOS compliance mdash not reform. ldquo The biggest thing to remember is that it is really still about HOS reinforcement, rdquo says DeLorenzo. ldquo All we rsquo re really doing is moving from paper logs to electronic records. rdquo Executive Director Collin Mooney of the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance CVSA also affirmed that the HOS enforcement rules would remain untouched by the mandate. Back in August, the CVSA announced a ldquo phasing-in rdquo enforcement period from December 18, 2017, to April 1, 2018. Within this time window, safety inspectors will cite and fine vehicles without ELDs. However, they won rsquo t be placing vehicles out of service until April 1, 2018. The phasing-in stage can significantly impact the Compliance Safety Accountability CSA scores prescribed and acknowledged by the FMCSA. According to DeLorenzo, ldquo The tricky issue with CSA is that the program treats an inspection, an inspection with a warning, and an inspection with a violation, all the same. rdquo Over half of commercial fleets still don rsquo t have ELDs Another issue discussed in the MC amp E 2017 is drivers and fleets delaying their adoption of ELDs. In a study published by C.J. Driscoll amp Associates, an alarming 60 of commercial fleets are still tracking HOS using paper logs. ldquo That rsquo s a little scary in terms of supply and demand, rdquo says Clem Driscoll mdash President of C.J. Driscoll amp Associates. The study surveyed a total of 529 fleet operators in the United States. Over a third of the respondents who haven rsquo t transitioned to ELDs said they would do so in the fourth quarter of this year. When such a large number of truckers simultaneously try to get ELDs, there will be confusion and panic. Industry experts believe that the situation would lead to an ELD supply shortage. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you buy and install ELDs while they are still available. Other issues tackled during the MC amp E panel discussions In addition to everything mentioned above, the MC amp E panel also addressed a number of other issues Similar to paper logs, the FMCSA also requires ELD entries to have an ldquo annotation rdquo feature. This can be vital for drivers in certain situations, such as noting adverse driving conditions, which allows for two additional hours of driving time. It rsquo s been established that ELDs are not mandatory for vehicles with pre-2000 engines . Under the ELD rule , ldquo personal conveyance rdquo is deemed optional, so carriers may choose whether to allow it or not. When used, the accuracy of GPS tracking is expanded to a 10-mile radius, giving drivers more privacy during the personal use of CMVs. Automatic onboard recording devices, also known as AOBRDs, can still be used until December 16, 2019. After December 16, 2019, AOBRDs will have to be replaced with ELDs. A total of 135 self-certified devices are now included in the FMCSA rsquo s official ELD list . According to DeLorenzo, a case-by-case approach will be implemented when handling revoked certifications. ELD benefits In addition to helping carriers with data gathering, there are several other ways fleets and owner-operators can benefit from using ELDs 1. Less administrative work Fleet administrators and drivers will have lesser paperwork to deal with as ELDs automatically track and record the movement of vehicles and important pieces of information. According to estimates made by the FMCSA, drivers, in particular, spend 20 hours annually filling out paper logs and sending their records to their respective carriers. With an ELD, the time spent by drivers doing paperwork is cut by 15 minutes a day. As a result, they will have more time on the road, which can easily translate into higher income for drivers. 2. Easier communication between managers and drivers Before ELDs were introduced, dispatchers had to make a series of check calls to drivers for updates. During check calls, drivers would often relay their location, their estimated time of arrival, and their remaining drive time among other things . This can be very distracting for drivers, and the information is rarely 100 accurate. With ELDs, however, dispatchers get real-time updates of their drivers rsquo locations, progress, and estimated time of arrival. With a modern messaging system with latest features, fleet managers can easily communicate with drivers whenever they need to. 3. Crash prevention Virginia Tech did a study for the FMCSA analyzing the potential of ELDs to prevent accidents. Their research showed an 11.7 percent reduction rate in accidents involving drivers who used an ELD, and a marginal reduction rate 5.1 percent in preventable crashes than trucks that had no ELD. The FMCSA, for its part, has claimed on its website that ELDs are expected to prevent at least 26 deaths and 562 injuries annually. 4. Faster inspections When drivers don rsquo t use electronic logs, inspectors consume a lot of time understanding the handwritten papers logs and checking drivers rsquo records to determine if they rsquo ve been compliant with the HOS rules. With an ELD, however, everything becomes digital, making it easier for inspectors to review drivers rsquo records. As a result, road inspections are completed significantly faster, and drivers can get back on the road sooner. What rsquo s next? The message conveyed during the panel discussion is clear ldquo ELDs can help fleets and owner-operators adhere to the HOS rules. rdquo More importantly, the panel highlighted that ELDs don rsquo t change any of the Hours-of-Service regulations. In fact, the ELD mandate is all about enforcing HOS rules and monitoring drivers rsquo compliance statuses to improve safety . With the benefits that ELDs bring, truckers stand to gain from having the device installed in their vehicles. The sooner the devices are installed, the sooner they can enjoy the benefits of using ELDs. If you are without a compliant ELD, try Motive . The Motive ELD is FMCSA-registered , easy-to-use, and packed with useful fleet management features .\n",

            "The longer a person drives, the higher the likelihood of being cited for a violation. When you rsquo re a long-haul driver, this potential for violation citation goes way up. And can prove costly . nbsp Financial penalties are one concern. But losing your license can mean days off the road. Which hurts both the driver and damages the fleet rsquo s bottom line. This article explains common driver violations and how to avoid them. What constitutes a driver violation? There are many truck driving rules the driver and fleet operator need to understand and follow. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association FMCSA has passed regulations to keep drivers and the roads safe . A company may refuse to hire drivers with certain types of violations or who rsquo ve had truck violations within a certain period of time. Reduce risk with this roundup of the top common driver violations. Minimize violations and stay in ELD compliance with Motive. Common driver violations Operating past 14 hours on duty One key area of driving limits is the amount of time the driver can be on duty. According to the FMCSA rsquo s Hours of Service HOS rules , ldquo a property-carrying driver may drive only during a period of 14 consecutive hours after coming on duty following 10 consecutive hours off duty. The driver may not drive after the end of the 14-consecutive-hour period without first taking 10 consecutive hours off duty. rdquo If a driver operates past 14 hours on duty, that rsquo s considered an hours of service violation, a critical violation of 395.3 a 2 . For passenger-carrying drivers, the limit is 15 cumulative hours. Driving over 60 70 hours in 7 8 days According to 395.3 b 1, a driver may not drive after 60 hours on duty in seven consecutive days, applicable for carriers that don rsquo t operate every day of the week. Or, 70 hours on duty in eight consecutive days for carriers that do operate every day of the week. The 7 8 consecutive day period can be restarted if the driver takes 34 or more consecutive hours off duty. A thorough understanding of the 34-hour restart rule and the 60-hour 7-day and 70-hour 8-day limit can allow commercial motor vehicle drivers to restart their cycle. And get back on the road more quickly. Learn more about the nbsp 34-hour restart rule nbsp here. nbsp Note Drivers can record the 34-hour break with the Motive App in two simple steps. No record of duty status According to the nbsp FMCSA rsquo s regulations 395.8a , a motor carrier must require each of its drivers to record the driver rsquo s duty status for each 24-hour period. If a carrier fails to do so, it rsquo s considered a critical violation with a severity weight of 5 out of 10. If a driver isn rsquo t exempt from the nbsp ELD mandate , they rsquo ll need an nbsp FMCSA-registered electronic logging device nbsp to record the duty status. However, there are some exceptions. For instance, drivers who qualify for the 100 air-mile radius exemption per 49 CFR 395.1 e 1 3 nbsp and 150 air-mile radius exemption per 49 CFR 395.1 e 2 3 nbsp aren rsquo t required to keep record of duty status RODS . However, they must keep accurate time records for six months. The time records must contain the following information The time the driver reports for duty each day The total number of hours the driver is on duty each day The time the driver is released from duty each day The total time for the preceding seven days in accordance with Section 395.8 j 2 For more information on a driver rsquo s record of duty status and supporting documentation, nbsp click here . If you rsquo re interested in learning more about HOS exemptions, check out this article nbsp 4 hours of service exemptions drivers and fleet managers should know . False logs Falsification of logs is one of the top three most common driver violations found during the annual International Roadcheck. In 2021, 14.7 of drivers were placed out of service because of falsified log books. Falsifying logs is a critical violation that has a severity weight of 7. Wrong class license Having the wrong class license is another violation more common than many people think. During the International Roadcheck 2021 , having the wrong class license was the second biggest driver violation. Accounting for 565 violations or 19.5 of driver violations. There are multiple types of driver licenses CDL Class A . It rsquo s required for drivers who operate any combination of vehicles CMV with a gross combination weight rating GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds. Provided the towed vehicle is heavier than 10,000 pounds. CDL Class B . It rsquo s required to operate a CMV with a GVWR of 26,0001 or more pounds. Or tow a vehicle not heavier than 10,000 pounds. CDL Class C . It rsquo s required to operate a CMV designed to transport 16 or more people, including the driver. Or to transport hazardous materials, as defined under the federal law. Traffic violations Any driver on the road can be penalized for speeding violations or other traffic violations. The commercial vehicle driver isn rsquo t exempt from citation for truck violations such as Speeding Erratic or improper lane changes Tailgating nbsp Using a hand-held nbsp cellphone in states where it rsquo s prohibited With fleet management software , risk managers can keep an eye on traffic violation trends. Drivers can be identified for additional coaching or receive targeted in-app coaching after their route is done. Carelessness and negligence Another cause of truck driver violations? Carelessness. The driver may be changing the radio channel, smoking, or eating while driving. And end up bumping another vehicle off the road. nbsp Inattention or distracted driving can see a truck swerving into another lane, failing to yield, and so much more. This carelessness may not cause an accident. But when it does, the driver could face charges of negligence. Common negligent driving examples include failing to stop at a red light. Speeding or driving too slowly. Or failing to use the vehicle rsquo s turn signals. Improper equipment The FMCSA also regulates specific safety equipment for every commercial vehicle such as mirrors, lights , reflectors, and brakes. The driver is also expected to keep a roadside emergency kit with specifically mandated items in it. Additionally, all trailers must have an underride bar to prevent another vehicle from running underneath the tractor-trailer truck. The bar is commonly known as a ldquo DOT bar. rdquo Substance abuse Fleet drivers must meet a higher standard when it comes to substance abuse than other motorists. To help identify substance abusers on the road, the FMCSA Clearinghouse rule nbsp requires FMCSA-regulated employers and their service agents to record their employees rsquo DOT drug and alcohol violations under Part 382 of the FMCSA rsquo s regulations. The rule also requires them to populate the clearinghouse an electronic database with verification of a CDL driver rsquo s completed steps in the return-to-duty process. As of the end of December 2021 , a total of 111,025 drug violations were reported and 2.544 alcohol violations had been recorded since January 6, 2020 when the clearinghouse became operational. Understanding fines, points, and penalties These common driving violations risk road safety. They can also cost time and money and lead to loss of points as well as stiffer penalties. Educate your drivers about the potential risks that accompany these violations to help keep them informed and accountable. nbsp nbsp nbsp Hours-of-service violations Drivers who violate the regulation of operating past 14 hours on duty, or driving over 60 70 hours in 7 8 days, commonly face fines. They can also accumulate points on their licenses. The amount of the fine and number of points accumulated will vary depending on the severity of the violation and the specific regulations of the jurisdiction. nbsp In severe situations, or for repeat offenders, the driver rsquo s license may be suspended. Hours-of-service violations also may attract the attention of regulators and lead a fleet to experience more frequent inspections, audits, and potential penalties. Recordkeeping violations The FMCSRs identify several possible recordkeeping violations. These cover Failing to prepare or maintain a record required by part 40 of Title 49 nbsp Preparing or maintaining a required record that is incomplete, inaccurate, or false Knowingly falsifying, destroying, mutilating, or changing a report or record These violations are subject to a maximum civil penalty of 1,496 for each day the violation continues, up to 14,960, according to the May 2023 amendment. nbsp A driver convicted of violating an out-of-service order can be fined not less than 2,500 and not less than 5,000 for a second or subsequent conviction. Employers convicted of these violations are subject to a civil penalty between 2,750 and 25,000. Out of service order violation A driver who drives within the 24 hours they rsquo ve been placed out of service for a CDL violation or violating alcohol prohibitions can face a civil penalty not to exceed 3740 for a first conviction and not less than 7481 for a second or subsequent conviction. Meanwhile, an employer who knowingly allows, requires, permits, or authorizes an employee to operate a CMV during any period in which the CDL-holder is subject to an out-of-service order, is subject to a civil penalty of not less than 6,755 or more than 37,400. Other road violations Drivers who violate traffic law, or are found careless or negligent, may have to pay fines. The amount can vary depending on the severity of the violation and where it takes place. In a jurisdiction where driving violations lead to points, the driver can also expect to accumulate points on their license. Too many points can lead to license suspension or other penalties. Road violations can also lead to increased insurance premiums for both the driver and the fleet operator. Depending on the fleet company rsquo s policies, and the severity of the offense, the driver may have to participate in retraining programs or face suspension or termination. nbsp If the violation results in an accident or injury, there could also be legal consequences. The driver and or fleet could be sued or face criminal charges. Improper equipment Maintaining proper equipment ensures road safety for drivers and the public. VIolations regarding nbsp improper equipment usage can net fines. The fine amount typically depends on the severity of the violation, the number of violations, and the specific regulations in place. The fleet may also have to meet compliance orders issued by regulatory agencies. Generally, operators are given a set timeframe to remedy the equipment issues. Fleets that violate equipment restrictions can also expect increased inspections and scrutiny, which can lead to potential penalties for non-compliance. If the situation is an immediate risk, the authorities could impound the fleet rsquo s vehicles. In severe cases, the fleet may even have its operating authority suspended or revoked. How to use Motive to keep drivers on the right side of the law Roadside inspections can happen practically anywhere. That rsquo s why commercial motor vehicle drivers must always be prepared for safety inspections. An FMCSA-registered ELD helps keep fleets accountable. nbsp Motive rsquo s ELD can inform drivers of upcoming HOS violations with timely alerts ahead of potential violations.

            "The truck driver shortage is nothing new, but the pandemic and ongoing global supply chain issues aren rsquo t helping. President Biden rsquo s administration made truck driver hiring a national policy priority in late 2021, which means you rsquo re not alone in facing driver recruitment and retention challenges. That rsquo s reassuring, but makes competition stiff for skilled drivers. These driver recruitment and retention strategies can help. Why is it important to have a good driver recruitment strategy? The national driver shortage puts pressure on supply chain logistics. The American Trucking Associations estimates a national shortfall of approximately 80,000 drivers. Your fleet isn rsquo t suffering the shortage on that scale. However, any driver shortage undermines the productivity and profitability of your organization. You want to deliver cargo in a timely and efficient way, but you could end up with a backlog without drivers available to take the routes. Even worse, you may have to turn customers away. nbsp Create a fleet safety program with these free resources. Plus, drivers rushing to complete deliveries to accept more work can risk road safety . Drivers may feel pressured to drive aggressively or engage in other dangerous behaviors trying to keep up with demand. nbsp Truck driver recruitment tips This article rsquo s truck driver recruiting ideas can help you compete with other commercial fleets for freshly trained, new drivers and the experienced driver looking for a new opportunity. nbsp Target prospects in compelling marketing materials You may have glossy marketing materials that discuss your company rsquo s greatness. You discuss when the company was established, growth achieved, awards won, and more. It all makes your company look good to customers and investors, but creating distinct, compelling marketing materials targeting prospective drivers makes more sense. Truck drivers aren rsquo t as interested in their company rsquo s achievements. More than anything else, they want to know what benefits them. After all, what good does it do them to get hired by the most prestigious trucking company, if they only get half the benefits that other drivers get? When creating your recruitment marketing materials, be sure to answer the question, ldquo What rsquo s in it for me? rdquo Unless you give this question a compelling enough answer, you won rsquo t get nearly as many applicants. Run a referral program Word of mouth is your most powerful marketing tool. If you want to recruit more drivers, then you need to run referral programs so your drivers can tell their connections about it. Drivers might be reluctant to refer new drivers to your fleet for fear of losing work. Some drivers have the mindset that more drivers mean less work for them. Be sure to outline how having more drivers will let your fleet take on more loads. That means more work for everybody. Establish a web presence Most professionals nowadays check out a company rsquo s digital presence before even considering working for them. Drivers are doing the same. Especially younger drivers who are just starting out in the industry. An established web presence gives truck drivers a better feel of who you are as a company. This should include An attractive, informative business website Landing pages outlining your driver recruitment program, paid commercial driver license CDL training if you offer it , wages and benefits, and what makes your company appealing and distinct Social media accounts that don rsquo t just show ads. Your content should also capture your business culture and what it rsquo s like to be a driver for your fleet. Optimize your applications First, you need to make the application mobile-friendly. You rsquo ll attract more candidates by making it easier for someone to apply on the go. nbsp Also, optimize your process. If your application process is like doing a decathlon and someone else rsquo s is like playing Tic Tac Toe, you could lose out on qualified candidates. Try to make your application process smooth and simple. Streamline the timeline for hiring too. You don rsquo t want to miss out on a candidate simply because it took you two weeks to respond rather than one. Why driver retention strategies are important too Losing your truck drivers to your competitors is never good. Finding and recruiting a new truck driver is costly. It rsquo s estimated that turnover for a single driver can cost up to 15,000, adding up to an industry-wide cost of 2.8 billion per year. As all companies and drivers are unique, there rsquo s no one-size-fits-all formula to reducing driver turnover. Still, these truck driver retention strategies can help you combat driver turnover . nbsp Driver retention strategies to keep your best drivers Retaining existing, trained drivers is another way fleet managers can address the truck driver shortage. Provide better working conditions to drivers Better working conditions will encourage drivers to stay with your company instead of looking for greener pastures. Combat driver turnover by doing what you can to make drivers rsquo lives easier. nbsp Installing electronic logg ing devices ELDs in your trucks is certainly a good starting point. A common driver complaint is poor direction on how to get to the consignee or shipper, or getting stuck in traffic. Remove this challenge for drivers by installing ELDs in your trucks. Moreover, ELDs completely remove the possibility of form and manner violations. They also improve drivers rsquo ratings and minimize the number of penalties. Provide a sense of community The new driver won rsquo t be the only one that feels disconnected from your company if there isn rsquo t a fleet culture. For a smaller fleet, it will be easier to remember your drivers rsquo birthdays and other personal details. Even fleet managers in a mid-sized company can check in regularly with drivers to see how they rsquo re feeling about their job. nbsp Treat all your drivers like professionals and a part of a larger fleet community by encouraging work-life balance. Offer education about retirement and health benefits. Provide tips encouraging healthy habits while on long-haul routes. Inform them about new trends and regulation changes. nbsp Showing appreciation can help too, and we don rsquo t just meet during National Truck Driver Appreciation Week . Create driver feedback loops Regardless of the industry, strong employee retention begins with effective communication . Your drivers will engage more with your company if they have opportunities to share their input and feel that their recommendations are being heard. nbsp Set up advisory councils. Use suggestion boxes. Have your fleet managers meet regularly with drivers. Even run surveys using apps. You might also use your ELD to send messages directly to your drivers. nbsp Before making any momentous adjustments to your bonus system, survey your drivers to learn what rsquo s important to them. Keep in mind that money isn rsquo t always the answer. Also, ask what they don rsquo t want as an incentive to avoid disgruntled drivers. Take action on your drivers rsquo suggestions. They rsquo ll feel appreciated as a real person, not just a number. Offer ongoing development opportunities Driver turnover rates are particularly high among new drivers 70 of drivers leave a carrier within the first year. 57 of newly hired drivers leave within the first six months. 35 of new drivers make it through the first 90 days on the job. Successful onboarding of new employees can help you get immediate buy-in from new recruits. Continuing to offer driver training can make a big dent in these numbers. New drivers often complain about not feeling understood, fully prepared, or connected to their company. You can address this with individualized coaching and mentor programs . Maintain good relationships even when drivers leave This may seem like a counterintuitive thing to discuss in an article on driver recruitment tips and retention strategies. But if you maintain a strong relationship with your drivers even after theory leave, they may return to the fold before long. It isn rsquo t uncommon for drivers to look for other opportunities. When that happens, instead of taking the drivers rsquo actions personally, try to see things from their perspective. In discussing their exit, have an open discussion with them about their frustrations with your fleet. Identifying their reasons for departure may help you make changes to help retain your other drivers. Also, let them know they rsquo re still welcome in your company should they decide to return. How Motive can help with your truck driver retention Drivers have many options available to them. By embracing technology, such as Motive rsquo s fleet management and safety platform , you can make your company stand out. nbsp ELDs reduce the pain of paperwork and staying compliant.

            "There rsquo s no better example of a conundrum than the transportation industry, the economy, and the environment. Without trucks, economies suffer. With trucks and the emissions they create, the environment suffers. From an economic perspective, in 2019 U.S. transportation services in air, rail, truck, and water contributed 237.7 billion to the GDP. Trucking contributed the largest amount of all the freight modes, at 368.9 billion. On the environmental side, in 2018 freight trucks contributed 23 of the greenhouse gas emissions. 1 Transportation as a whole contributed 28 of those emissions. 2 nbsp There are numerous ways the transportation industry is doing its part to keep economies healthy and reduce emissions. One area any type of fleet or driver can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas is to use less gas. To use less gas means fleet managers need to understand where each gallon goes and identify areas to reduce waste to improve environmental sustainability . Why fleet fuel visibility matters Fuel is expensive, especially these days, and fuel usage is harmful to the environment. Emissions from the trucking industry are responsible for 8 of the total annual carbon emissions in North America, with freight comprising nearly a quarter of total emissions. While the promise of electric vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles enjoy positive news coverage, the reality is that these technologies are five to 10 years out from major adoption within the industry. In the fleet management business, margins are thin and operating costs are high. nbsp After driver wages, fuel costs make up to 25 of a fleet rsquo s operating costs. nbsp According to the latest figures available from the American Trucking Associations ATA in 2019 About 37.9 million trucks were registered and used for business purposes, excluding government and farm. Trucks used for business purposes consumed 45.6 billion gallons of fuel. That rsquo s 36.5 billion gallons of diesel fuel and 9.1 billion gallons of gasoline. Looking at Motive rsquo s own data from over 400,000 vehicles across thousands of unique make models, our customers consumed over 2 billion gallons of fuel last year. Challenges fleets face around fuel economy Challenges fleets face around fuel efficiency include Lack of visibility into driving behaviors affecting fuel performance Lack of standards covering good fuel economy vs. bad i.e., benchmarking Inability to determine causes of poor fuel performance nbsp Inability to identify specific coachable behaviors Factors affecting fuel efficiency Driver behavior Driver behavior makes a big difference when it comes to fuel efficiency. In a review of Motive rsquo s in-network data, we found a staggering gt 20 difference across the top and bottom performing drivers on the same make model after excluding outliers. Motive data shows that fleets with the top fuel savings have 40 less hard braking incidents and 79 less hard acceleration events per hour when compared to the rest. RPM and speed RPM and speeding have the biggest impact on fuel efficiency. nbsp After normalizing for road conditions, Motive data showed that heavy-duty vehicles experience a significant fuel economy drop once the RPM value crosses 1400 RPM. For medium-duty vehicles, 1800 RPM, and for light-duty vehicles, 1600 RPM. When drivers limit how often they rev the engine, they can significantly reduce fuel consumption. Speed is a factor too. For most vehicles, the optimal speed for max fuel efficiency is 55-60 mph. Generally, for heavy-duty vehicles, after 60 mph, fuel efficiency drops by about 1 for every 1 mph over. So, a vehicle running at 70 mph would have a 10 drop in fuel efficiency compared to one driving at 60 mph. To optimize fuel efficiency, drivers of heavy-duty vehicles need to understand that when they rsquo re traveling faster than a pre-specified highway speed, they rsquo re wasting fuel. nbsp Vehicle condition Keep fleet vehicles in top condition to avoid unnecessary fuel waste. Common vehicle conditions that negatively impact fuel consumption include nbsp A poorly tuned engine nbsp Improperly aligned or inflated tires Brake drag Dirty air filter nbsp A simple and effective way to keep your vehicles in tip-top shape is to use fleet management software and vehicle diagnostic data to identify which vehicles are in need of maintenance and replacement. Route and environment The route a fleet vehicle takes will play a role in fuel efficiency . If the driver encounters traffic or spends time idling for other reasons, that will negatively impact fuel consumption. Making many short trips can also reduce fuel economy . Whether or not a vehicle is loaded will impact fuel economy, so efficient routing makes sense. The environment can also factor. For example, driving on mountainous terrain or on unpaved roads can reduce fuel efficiency. Cold weather can also make your engine less efficient until it warms up. How Motive rsquo s Fuel Hub helps fleets nbsp Fleet owners need a holistic view of their fleet rsquo s fuel usage. Motive rsquo s Fuel Hub delivers the data and insights that improve fuel efficiency, along with the reporting and tracking needed to run a more streamlined operation. nbsp In a recent in-house assessment 3 of Motive rsquo s top Fuel Hub users, we found that these fleets on average Improved MPG by 13 . Reduced idling time by 20 . In 2021 alone, Fuel Hub improved fuel efficiency and saved Motive rsquo s top fleets an estimated 3 million gallons of fuel. Individual fleets have also improved fuel efficiency and driving behavior. A fleet running an annual distance of about 4.9 million miles saw 15 improvement in miles per gallon, with 27 reduction in idling time and 60 reduction in hard accelerations. nbsp A fleet running an annual distance of about 1.9 million miles saw 13 improvement in miles per gallon, with 15 reduction in idling time and 94 reduction in hard accelerations. A fleet running an annual distance of about 2.6 million miles saw 9 improvement in miles per gallon, with 15 reduction in idling time and 86 reduction in hard accelerations. Fuel Hub provides a holistic view into your fleet rsquo s fuel consumption. Identify trends, know what to change to improve, and benchmark performance against Motive rsquo s extensive network of 600,000 vehicles across North America. Fuel Hub surfaces specific wasteful driver behaviors, including over RPM and higher driving speed, so you know exactly where you need to focus your efforts when coaching . Also, the Fuel Hub leaderboard can be used to identify and retain your top drivers and reward them for their fuel efficiency. Using the Fuel Hub , fleets can better manage vehicle inventory nbsp by keeping the more efficient vehicles and retiring or repairing the gas guzzlers. nbsp Motive customers save money and contribute to a cleaner, greener environment. Part of Motive rsquo s mission is to help the trucking industry reduce about 10 of their total fuel consumption and save billions of dollars. From a sustainability standpoint, this means potentially reducing 20 million tons of CO2 emissions. To put that in perspective, that rsquo s the equivalent of planting 900 million trees mdash or the number of adult trees in Denali national park. nbsp Sources Freight Transportation amp the Economy Forbes.com Using machine learning to reduce carbon emissions in the trucking industry Motive data from 2020 to 2022 Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator - Calculations and References\n",

            "In a wide-ranging conversation, part two of Motive rsquo s supply chain webinar series looked at critical steps to digital transformation. Featured speakers included Greg Morrow, Director of Operations for ARL Transport, and Travis Baskin, Motive rsquo s Head of Regulatory Affairs. Steve Keppler, Co-Director of Scopelitis Transportation Consulting , moderated the discussion. Listen to the webinar here. Don rsquo t have time to listen? Here rsquo s a recap of the session rsquo s key takeaways. nbsp What is digital transformation? nbsp Digital transformation involves using technology to work smarter, faster, better. Digital transformation uses automation and data to achieve better outcomes. Technologies such as collision avoidance tools and dash cams are helping companies become safer, more productive, and more profitable. ARL Transport is an intermodal drayage provider with more than 40 terminal locations in the U.S. and Canada. They rsquo re in the early stages of digital transformation but have learned a lot already. nbsp ldquo Before doing anything, you need to understand what your problems are and what in your operation needs to change, rdquo Morrow says. ldquo We know that companies are six times more likely to meet their objectives if they have a strong change management plan in place. By not having a plan, you rsquo re setting yourself up for failure. rdquo Transformation takes time and focus After establishing a plan, ARL Transport sought to adopt new processes and technologies. They provided onboarding training to managers and employees, then focused on changing the mindset of those resistant to change. ldquo Conveying why you rsquo re investing in technology, how employees will be affected, and what the change will mean to that group is so important, rdquo Morrow continues. ldquo It rsquo s helpful to get buy-in from all involved and to have someone in the group who rsquo s going to be the champion of change. Ultimately, you have to get away from the mentality that lsquo this is how we rsquo ve always done it. rsquo rdquo Adopting technology is the first step, Baskin says. But true digital transformation goes beyond adding to a portfolio bit by bit. nbsp ldquo It means embracing the culture of change and amending the way you rsquo ve classically done things, rdquo he says. ldquo True digital transformation involves leaning into the benefits that these technologies can bring to your operations. rdquo When rolling out new technology, the initial plans that fleets put into place are important, Morrow says. Leaders should expect those plans to evolve over time. ldquo What rsquo s the best way to eat an elephant? rdquo Baskin asks. ldquo It rsquo s by taking one bite at a time. When we talk about how we get started on this journey, it rsquo s really a matter of taking that first step. rdquo nbsp To learn about later steps in digital transformation, including how to use data, spot trends, and inspire continuous improvement, watch the full webinar here .\n",

            "If drivers were given the option of paid training versus unpaid training, they rsquo d likely choose paid training. This is also true of paid CDL training, which helps aspiring truck drivers gain their commercial driver rsquo s license CDL and earn money at the same time. This comprehensive article explores what truck drivers need to know about paid CDL training, and how companies can benefit from offering it. What is paid CDL training? Whether a driver wants a full-fledged trucking career or just to drive a commercial vehicle part-time, a CDL is required. Each state will have its own testing before an individual is certified to drive a commercial truck on highways. You rsquo ll first need to get a commercial learner rsquo s permit. Then, you rsquo ll need to go back to school. When you take paid CDL training, you rsquo ll get company-sponsored instructions instead of paying to attend a private trucking school on your own. To take advantage of paid company CDL training, you rsquo ll need to sign a contract with that fleet agreeing to work for them for a set period of time after your training is complete. This could be eight to 12 months. What are the advantages of paid CDL training? You don rsquo t have to pay 3,000 to 6,000 upfront before you even have a job lined up. Instead, you earn while you learn, knowing that you have employment at the end of the course work. Many trucking companies that offer paid CDL training don rsquo t require credit checks and will offer sign-on bonuses, full benefits, and yearly pay raises. There are some drawbacks to consider though. The fleet wants to get you on the road as soon as possible. So, you rsquo ll be in an intense learning environment. Some companies will have 10- to 15-hour training days. You may even be required to attend school nights or weekends. You may also need to travel a distance to train at the company-sponsored school. nbsp How do I qualify for paid CDL training? You rsquo ll need to be at least 21 years old and legally eligible to work within the United States. You rsquo ll also need a valid U.S. driver rsquo s license without any moving violations in the last three years. You must not have any DUI DWI convictions in the last five years and be able to pass a Department of Transportation DOT drug test and medical exam . What to expect from paid CDL training programs You may think that you already know how to drive if you have your driver rsquo s license, but driving a truck is a different experience. You rsquo ll be learning the rules of the road for trucks as well as how to maneuver and navigate the truck in tight spaces. Expect some book work and training in map reading, trip planning, Hours of Service HOS , and compliance. You rsquo ll also learn how to perform vehicle inspections and maneuver trucks on the road. Manuevers include advanced backing techniques, shifting up down double clutching , taking corners correctly, entering and exiting the road safely, defensive driving, up down grade management, and overall traffic and weather situation management. Do you always get paid for CDL training? No, so when interviewing for a trucking company, you should ask, ldquo Will I get paid for CDL training here? rdquo An important follow-up question is, ldquo Will I be required to repay my tuition? rdquo Some companies may expect you to pay back some or all of the training costs once you rsquo re out on the road. Also, ask where the training is offered. If you have to travel, you may have to pay for your own living expenses. What companies pay for CDL training? Many trucking companies offer paid CDL training. Truck Driving Schools Info reviews 26 of the best companies for you. Some to consider include Knight Transportation Prime Trucking Company KLLM Trucking Company FFE Trucking Roehl Transport Schneider nbsp Swift nbsp Smart Trucking suggests taking your paid CDL training with one of the bigger carriers. They rsquo re more likely to expect a certain amount of bang-ups as you learn and not penalize you as heavily. Plus, they rsquo re more likely to have equipment that rsquo s easier to work on while you get started. How and where to find CDL paid training Find CDL paid training programs by searching online or visiting a trucking industry information hub. For instance, TruckingTruth.com has you fill out one application for simultaneous consideration by several companies offering paid CDL training. You could also directly contact a company where you want to work and ask about their training programs. How do fleet companies benefit from paid CDL training? It rsquo s probably not news to you that there rsquo s a driver shortage. The number of drivers needed is at a ldquo historic high, rdquo according to the American Trucking Associations ATA . Company-paid CDL training helps fleet companies grow their candidate pool. Aspiring drivers will be more interested in working with a company that offers paid training. At the same time, you rsquo ll get better-qualified drivers . nbsp When drivers are under-equipped for their role with your fleet, it can prove costly. Even the best optimized routes may take longer if the driver isn rsquo t up on HOS requirements, involved in accidents, or running trucks so hard that they require more out-of-service maintenance time. As part of your paid training program, cover HOS documentation and maintenance reports as well as how to understand ELD inspections and how to prepare for them. All this will improve driver efficiency and overall fleet productivity. Continue coaching after CDL training with Motive Helping drivers to be their best doesn rsquo t have to stop with paid CDL training programs. Motive rsquo s fleet management software improves driver productivity and increases safety department productivity by providing insights into areas that require further coaching. Using the DRIVE risk score , you can identify individual drivers who could use more training regarding braking, accelerating, cornering, speeding, or more. nbsp Motive draws fleet data and insights across its vast network to benchmark driver safety and objectively determine risk. Motive rsquo s platform also automatically analyzes, contextualizes, and prioritizes safety events and tracks coaching impact to gauge improvement in driving behaviors over time. Motive rsquo s platform also simplifies roadside inspections, which benefits not only your company but also the rookie drivers. In fact, our team even trained with Arizona rsquo s Department of Public Safety Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Troopers to ensure we build tools that best suit drivers and fleet managers. Paid CDL training can help you recruit new and more skilled drivers . By providing ongoing coaching, you can retain the drivers you rsquo ve invested in already. Request a demo today.\n",

            "Transporting hazardous materials adds a layer of complexity to the trucking job. The cargo could harm people, animals, or the environment. However, by exercising caution, understanding the materials, and using fleet management tools, hazmat trucking can be a rewarding field to be in. Fleet managers need to know all about managing the risks. This guide can help. What is hazmat trucking? Hazmat trucking is the transport of hazardous materials, which could be anything from hazardous gasses or poisons to waste or radioactive materials. The cargo could cause harm either on its own or when it comes into contact with air, flame, water, or other chemicals. nbsp Although driving safely is always a priority , it rsquo s critically important in hazmat trucking. Drivers hauling a hazmat load have the added stress of ensuring they are following the additional regulations for this type of cargo. Plus, they may need to avoid certain routes to detour around hazmat restricted areas. Fleet managers can make this easier for drivers by providing training and optimized routing . Finding success in hazmat trucking also requires understanding the different classifications of cargo. More on that next. Hazmat classifications explained The Department of Transportation DoT has established nine classes of hazardous material. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA requires drivers to have hazardous material placards on the vehicle that correctly identify the hazmat category. Examples for each class to follow . Hazmat Class 1 Explosives There are six categories within this category depending on the type of explosion involved. This class includes dynamite, gun powder, and fireworks. The different categories within this class reflect whether there are mass explosions, projections, or fire considerations as well as the level of sensitivity. Hazmat Class 2 Gases This class is divided into three categories Flammable gases 2.1 that burn readily in air Non-flammable gases 2.2 , which can include liquified or cryogenic liquids e.g. helium Poisonous gases 2.3 such as carbon monoxide Hazmat Class 3 Flammable Liquids These liquids could ignite if they rsquo re near an ignition source and at a temperature of 140 degrees or less. This class includes gasoline, ethanol, and many paints and solvents. Hazmat Class 4 Flammable Solids There are three divisions in this class. An example of a flammable solid 4.1 could be matchsticks. A spontaneously combustible material 4.2 and solid materials that are dangerous when wet 4.3 are also included. Hazmat Class 5 Oxidizing Substances Organic Peroxides Class 5 contains oxidizers 5.1 , which can contribute to the combustion of other materials. Hydrogen peroxide and silver nitrate are examples. The class also includes organic peroxides 5.2 , which have an oxidizer and an organic fuel. These are hazardous because they can release heat and energy at dangerous levels. Hazmat Class 6 Toxic and Infectious Substances Toxic substances may sound like Hollywood disaster film, but 6.1 covers any toxic or poisonous material solid or liquid presumed toxic to humans. Category 6.2 covers infectious substances. Hazmat Class 7 Radioactive Substances Uranium or plutonium qualify for class 7, but there are other radioactive materials such as X-ray equipment. Hazmat Class 8 Corrosive Materials Think battery acid or degreasers mdash materials with the ability to eat away at skin or other materials due to their acid low pH or base high pH levels. Hazmat Class 9 Miscellaneous Hazardous Materials Miscellaneous hazardous materials involve anything else that poses a threat while on the road. These materials can rsquo t be classified in the previous sections, so they rsquo re listed in Class 9. Hazmat regulations for trucking Hazmat trucking has its own set of regulations from the FMCSA Vehicles carrying hazardous materials are required to carry shipping papers containing the hazmat class and ID number or name . The vehicle should be marked on all four sides with hazmat placards. The ID number must be on the placards. Otherwise, the placard name is needed. nbsp For containers with bulk packages inside, if the required ID number marking isn rsquo t visible, the transport vehicle must be marked on each side and each end. The sub-category of the classification should be on the placard e.g. 5.1 or 5.2 . nbsp Hazmat drivers must also be over the age of 21 and meet certain education requirements. While on the road, hazmat drivers must also wear personal protective equipment PPE . Additionally, hazmat drivers need a hazmat endorsement on their commercial driver rsquo s license CDL . nbsp Best practices for hazmat transportation Hazmat driving is desirable and more competitive. Your drivers for hazmat transportation are typically more experienced. Still, there are some best practices that can help improve the hazmat transportation experience Plan the route with drivers to avoid fines and protect public safety, driver safety , and the environment. Coach drivers to be vigilant and aware of their surroundings when driving or delivering hazardous cargo. nbsp Standardize inspection processes and proactively maintain vehicles for optimal service. nbsp Connect new drivers with experienced mentors to pass on industry know-how. Hazmat truck driver responsibilities Hazmat truck driving adds responsibilities. Not only are drivers handling hazmat cargo, but they must adjust routes based on certain restrictions. Plus, many of the materials are time-sensitive, so prompt delivery can be an added stressor. This type of cargo also requires detailed records. Additionally, there are safety protocols to follow to ensure driver safety as well as safe loading, unloading, and or disposal. How to become a hazmat driver Trucking companies will often pay a premium for hazmat trucking jobs. To get hired you rsquo ll need to show you rsquo re attentive to detail and a careful driver. You rsquo ll need a clean driving record, and most fleets will be looking for you to have a couple years of non-hazardous material truck driving first. You rsquo ll also need the hazmat endorsement, which requires TSA background checks, a written test, and a DOT medical exam . In addition to the hazmat endorsement H , you rsquo re also likely to need a tanker endorsement X on your CDL. The X endorsement also requires its own knowledge test. Wondering if it rsquo s worth it? The Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates a seven percent growth rate in hazardous materials removal work from 2020 to 2030. Glassdoor reports the median total pay of a Class Z CDL Driver HazMat Tanker as 83,053 annually in 2022. For comparison, the average dry van driver earns 53,714 annually, according to ZipRecruiter . The dangers associated with hazmat trucking jobs Hazmat truck drivers are transporting explosives, gasses, corrosive materials, poisons, and more. These could be potentially harmful in the event of an accident. Depending on the hazmat class, there rsquo s also the chance of a criminal element trying to take control of that cargo in transit.

            "Global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and the depletion of Earth rsquo s natural resources are a growing concern. Scientists warn of climate dangers. Governments establish fresh regulations. Meanwhile, businesses have recognized the value of considering logistics and environment together. Green logistics can help a company reduce climate impact. Embracing sustainable logistics also helps delivery and trucking companies . What is green logistics? Green logistics, also called eco-logistics, looks at making operations more sustainable. Every area of the business can be evaluated and optimized, including making changes to nbsp Reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cut energy use. Lower fuel consumption. Streamline delivery routes. Use the most efficient equipment. Adjust product sourcing. Improve warehouse efficiency. Source ethically. Offset carbon emissions. Rely on clean fuel, renewable energy sources. Measure and report sustainability metrics. Why does sustainable logistics matter? Transportation is a sector of the economy with the greatest greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA . Transportation includes the movement of people and goods by cars, trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, and other vehicles. In 2019 this sector contributed 6,558 nbsp million metric tons of CO2 equivalent , making it responsible for 29 of the country rsquo s greenhouse gases. nbsp Supply chain logistics has a quantifiable impact on the environment. It can also impact a business rsquo s bottom line. Customers are growing more environmentally conscious, which means sustainability practices are even more vital to purchasing decisions. nbsp A green supply chain sees shippers decreasing their carbon dioxide emissions, dealing with waste disposal and overall waste management, using recyclable materials, and more. nbsp Sustainable logistics can help companies stand out and thrive as they make ambitious zero-net goals or promise to go as green as possible. How to measure your carbon footprint There are many calculators available online to help businesses measure their carbon footprint. When measuring your carbon footprint, Puro Earth explains you rsquo ll need to decide ldquo which parts of the value chain you want to include rdquo and ldquo at which accuracy level the calculation will be made. rdquo You should also understand ldquo why the carbon footprint calculation is needed, as this affects the level of accuracy required. rdquo How does logistics affect the environment? Yes, electric vehicles are on the logistics horizon. However, gas-powered vehicles are the standard for delivery and hauling. These vehicles emit significant CO2 into the atmosphere. With online shopping and the need for last-mile delivery increasing, logistics industry emissions are predicted to grow . nbsp Green logistics emphasizes optimized supply chain management to decrease the time and mileage spent performing the same amount of deliveries. Reducing energy consumption and asset wear with more efficient logistics processes not only increases profitability but also reduces the environmental impact. Can you save money through sustainable logistics? A sustainable logistics environment benefits the planet and your business. Green logistics is about increasing efficiency and optimizing asset use, benefiting your bottom line too. Green logistics helps you save money by Reducing fuel costs Optimizing routes nbsp Improving dispatch and workflow Keeping up with preventative maintenance Avoiding vehicle breakdowns Prolonging asset life You rsquo ll be more profitable too. For example, route optimization can help you plan your deliveries smarter and save time. That makes your customers happy and brings in more business. Plus, your drivers will be happier with how you run your operations, which can make it easier for you to retain your top talent. Keep in mind that consumers are putting increasing pressure on companies to prioritize sustainability. This means your customers are looking to improve the sustainability of their supply chains. You may better retain your current client base and appeal to new customers with green logistics strategies. Top tips for employing sustainable logistics You can rsquo t just flip a switch and go green. Sustainable logistics requires new approaches to many of the old ways of doing things. Try these top tips to give green logistics greater priority in your operations. Optimize route planning nbsp Drivers, operations managers, and customers all benefit from route optimization. Identifying the best way to get to a destination involves finding the most time- and cost-efficient routes. The planning also considers how to maximize the time and number of orders without compromising compliance-required stops. Robust route optimization software can help by performing complex calculations weighing Customer time windows Vehicle capacity Traffic congestion Distance between stops Find fuel savings Motive rsquo s Fuel Hub uses telematics to analyze driver and vehicle fuel efficiency. With the power of artificial intelligence analyzing the billions of daily data points on our network, Fuel Hub can identify how, and where, your fleet can save on fuel with unparalleled accuracy. With AI helping you to understand trends and benchmark performance, you can compare your fleet against others with the same vehicle types. Review an individual driver rsquo s fuel consumption over time to identify behaviors that could impact fuel economy. Motive rsquo s driver coaching tools even help you address wasteful habits such as hard braking or speeding. Reduce idling Truck idling is costly. Excessive vehicle idling hurts the vehicle rsquo s engine life and inflates fuel costs. A typical truck consumes 1,800 gallons per year in idling. The cost is about 4,300 per year in idle fuel consumption. Plus, idling causes an estimated 2,000 annual increase in maintenance costs per truck. nbsp Although there are valid reasons to address idling, it rsquo s also harmful to the environment . The Environmental Protection Agency EPA reports that truck and locomotive engine idling emits 11 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, along with 200,000 tons of oxides of nitrogen and 5,000 tons of particulate matter. Idling pollutants have also been linked to serious human illnesses including asthma, heart disease, chronic bronchitis, and cancer. Protect asset lifespan Sustainability doesn rsquo t stop at cutting carbon emissions. Environment logistics also considers the importance of fully using our resources. Every truck has a finite lifespan. Maintenance, refurbishment, and replacements aren rsquo t always environmentally friendly. nbsp Reducing wear and tear and working to extend the lifetime of your assets increases return on investment. At the same time, you reduce waste and prioritize end-to-end sustainability. Digitize paper nbsp Technological advancements have rendered paper trails obsolete. With an electronic logging device , everything you need to know about a trip e.g., miles, fuel, IFTA reporting is recorded digitally. nbsp Digital driver dispatch software also does away with dispatch paperwork by automatically delivering the relevant information to the driver rsquo s phone. Giving drivers the ability to track vehicle inspections and maintenance information in an app also eases the burden of reporting. The necessary records are impossible to lose as they rsquo re immediately accessible to fleet managers. Plus, the electronic logs are more accurate than those kept manually, on paper, by busy drivers. How to use Motive as your green logistics program Motive rsquo s fleet management software supports green logistics. Limit fuel consumption and costs with GPS tracking and route optimization. Putting drivers on the most efficient routes also reduces wear and tear on valuable fleet assets. Cut back on idling time too. With the ability to monitor asset diagnostics in a single dashboard, you can find fuel savings and also schedule preventative maintenance to prolong asset lifespans. The digital solutions from Motive also streamline logging and compliance with ELD devices and an easy-to-use Driver App. Successful green logistics requires total visibility into every aspect of fleet management. Over 120,000 businesses trust Motive to improve the sustainability, safety, and profitability of their fleets. Request a demo today .\n",

            "This article explains what a space cushion is, why it rsquo s important, and how to accomplish it on the road. Plus, we rsquo ll talk about how driver software solutions can help preserve space cushion and support road safety . What is a space cushion in driving? You rsquo ve heard of and probably been in ldquo bumper-to-bumper traffic. rdquo Yet it rsquo s highly unlikely you rsquo ve ever literally had your vehicle rsquo s bumper that close to another bumper. That rsquo s because when learning to drive, you were taught the value of leaving empty space around your vehicle at all times. The room between your vehicle and other vehicles on the road is called a space cushion. We need a space cushion when driving to account for reaction time. Every driver has a different reaction time depending on their age, vision, skill, and more. The cushion allows time to not only see what rsquo s happening on the road ahead, but to process that information and react. Unsafe driving can happen whether vehicles are in motion or at rest. Drivers need to maintain space cushions at traffic stops to help avoid multi-vehicle pile-ups. nbsp What is the benefit of a space cushion around your vehicle? Traffic collisions not only risk injuries and vehicle damage but are also costly. According to the 2021 Driver Safety Report , on-the-job highway crashes cost employers 66,119 per million vehicle miles of travel. rdquo A space cushion provides a buffer to help prevent collisions and the necessary room to react in an emergency. In a dangerous situation, if you have the space, you rsquo ll be able to brake or maneuver your vehicle away from a potential hazard. Following too closely is a common cause of collisions on the road. Without a space cushion, you may hit a vehicle from behind or be forced into another lane of traffic. These crashes can cause common injuries such as whiplash, back pain, hip damage, concussions, scrapes, and bruises. Or even more serious injuries such as damaged internal organs, traumatic brain injuries, or death. Even a collision that doesn rsquo t result in injuries can cause insurance premiums to rise and see a fleet vehicle taken off the road for maintenance. nbsp How do you calculate a space cushion while driving? Now that you know the benefits of a space cushion, we rsquo ll cover how to calculate a space cushion while driving. The Smith system has five key rules to help you maintain the appropriate space between your vehicle and others on the road. Also, keep in mind that distracted driving and inclement weather can both negatively impact your reaction time. Of course, it rsquo s best to not drive while distracted. But you can rsquo t always control the conditions for your drive. When the weather is poor or the sun is shining just below your windshield visor, road visibility will suffer. So you rsquo ll want to extend your space cushion. Smith system 5 keys to space cushion driving In 1952, Harold L. Smith, a naval veteran, introduced his trademarked system to reduce the chance of accidents with a space cushion. The system is known as The Smith5Keys . 1. Aim High in Steering reg nbsp Scan the road ahead at all times to get information about its conditions. You rsquo ll be looking out above the steering wheel to give yourself a 15-second eye lead time to see and process. 2. Get the Big Picture reg Keep a seven-second minimum following distance . Cars follow a three-second rule, but trucks take longer to maneuver. Scan your mirrors to remain aware of changes in your driving environment. This is the one-Mississippi, two-Mississippi kind of counting. nbsp Pick a static object like a tree or lamp post. When the vehicle ahead of you passes that landmark, start counting until you reach the same object. Defensive driving experts recommend adding one second to your following distance for any condition less than ideal. nbsp 3. Keep Your Eyes Moving reg If you have the experience of driving and not knowing what exit you just passed or what you saw over the last few miles, you were likely spacing out. By moving your eyes frequently and avoiding focusing on any one object too long, you rsquo ll be able to stay more alert and aware. 4. Leave Yourself an Out reg Maintain a space cushion and anticipate what might happen around you, so you can react and maneuver out of the way. 5. Make Sure They See You reg To make sure other drivers see you , flash your headlights, use turn signals, and make direct eye contact. You can even use your air horn to ensure that other drivers are aware of you. What areas of your vehicle should always have adequate space cushions? Drivers are responsible for creating a space cushion in front of their vehicles. You also need to be aware of the sides and rear of your vehicle. Drivers need to know if someone is driving in their blindspot or if they rsquo re in someone else rsquo s blindspot. The rear-end space cushion is meant to be preserved by the driver behind you. However, you should still be aware of people tailgating you. Which part of your space cushion is the most difficult to control? Since you have to count on other drivers to preserve the rear-end space cushion, it rsquo s the most difficult to control. When someone is driving too closely, you can take action Slow down and let the other driver pass you. Change lanes to again create a space cushion. However, when backing up a truck, it can be challenging to keep that space cushion. The easiest solution? Whenever possible, don rsquo t back up. If you can rsquo t use pull-through parking, and have to back up, get the overall picture first. Walk around your vehicle to identify any possible obstacles. Difficult terrain like steep mountains and hills or hairpin turns are more stressful for commercial drivers too. Learn how to stay safe when driving downhill. How Motive supports safe commercial driving Leaving a space cushion isn rsquo t the only way to support commercial driving safety . Technology is changing the trucking industry and playing an important part in improving road safety. Fleet management software and dash cams can help fleets with driver training and changing unsafe driving habits while improving driver retention. Motive rsquo s nbsp driver safety solution automatically ranks drivers according to how safely they drive. With the help of Motive rsquo s proprietary DRIVE risk score, safety managers can easily identify drivers who are involved in unsafe driving behaviors and require immediate coaching . Dash cams enhance driver safety and offer benefits such as improved commercial driver safety training and coaching programs . The video footage can also help Lower CSA scores . Protect drivers from false claims. Expedite insurance processes. Increase accountability.

            "When you go to a restaurant with white glove servers, you expect premium attention to detail and quality care. The same is true of white glove delivery service . This guide to running white glove delivery will help you know what your customers expect and how to meet the challenges with this type of delivery. What is white glove delivery? First, you don rsquo t actually need to wear white gloves to provide white glove delivery. It rsquo s your approach to service that changes when you tout white glove service. Your customers will expect the highest standards of care for their cargo and top-notch customer service along the way. nbsp White glove delivery has gained ground with the boom in online shopping. If people are shopping from an e-commerce site, they rsquo re not getting the chance to see the items they purchase first. They aren rsquo t going to shop with that online store again if their purchases don rsquo t arrive in pristine condition. With white glove delivery, you rsquo ll show your customers that you have great attention to detail and clear communication. The idea is that your clients don rsquo t need to worry about a thing. You rsquo ll take care of it all. What do white glove delivery services include? There are many ways to differentiate a white glove delivery service from the standard delivery approach. With white glove customer service, drivers don rsquo t just drop off the boxed delivery and leave. Instead, they unload the delivery, unpack, and possibly even assemble the items in the location the customer wants them. They rsquo ll also dispose of the packing materials and clear the workspace. They may also take away the old items the new purchases replaced. If something is wrong with the delivered product, the driver contacts customer service to make sure the issue is resolved. nbsp In fact, you can show white glove service before the item is even shipped with special, customized packaging services, such as ensuring the cargo is packed following best practices related to that freight rsquo s size, nature, value, and fragility. A higher quality of service means higher levels of communication too. The shipping partner can communicate with manufacturers or merchants to establish a delivery timeline and make sure customers know what to expect. The white glove delivery service can also reach out to discuss your specific needs before sending your freight out. They want to set up a convenient delivery time and make any necessary preparations to ensure the delivery goes as smoothly as possible. Top tips for running a white glove delivery service White glove delivery service isn rsquo t an indulgence. For some, it rsquo s a necessity to ensure that their precious cargo arrives in top condition. White glove service can also make your customers more productive as they rsquo re handing over the logistics of their delivery to your experts. They can focus on other things instead. Try these tips to make sure you offer a quality white glove delivery solution. Treat customer assets with care The priority with white glove delivery services is ensuring that freight gets from one location to the other without incident. The cargo may be fragile or has sentimental value. You won rsquo t necessarily know why the customer wants the highest level of care, but that shouldn rsquo t matter. Every item shipped with a white glove delivery service needs to be treated with the utmost care. Be communicative Whether you rsquo re shipping furniture, lighting fixtures, displays, sound systems, or other freight, you rsquo ll want to keep the customer updated with logistics. At every step of the way, communicate the timeline with the customer. Make sure that they know what to expect. nbsp If anything changes, let the customer know. When you communicate any issues, do so with a solution in mind. Again, this is a level of service where the customer is paying you more to not have to sweat the small stuff. Take advantage of logistics technology GPS tracking for your fleet can help you keep customers informed about their deliveries. Let them know when their freight is loaded on to your trucks and when to expect delivery. You rsquo ll have real-time visibility of your vehicle locations, which can help you optimize your drivers rsquo time on the road. Fleet managers can also use route planning to ensure the right truck route for making deliveries and drop-offs. Commercial route planning software can include GPS tracking to provide live updates on where trucks are, how fast they rsquo re traveling, and whether there are any upcoming obstructions. If something does slow the driver down, you can communicate that to the customer too. Anticipate customer needs Since white glove delivery is intended to give customers peace of mind, you can set your offerings apart from the competition by thinking ahead. You have the experience and skills your customer needs. Try to anticipate what might go wrong and make sure that it doesn rsquo t. Think of ways that you can make the logistics run smoother, and pursue those opportunities to go the extra mile without actually adding miles to your fleet . Hire well Your white glove delivery service drivers need to embrace the philosophy of customer care and high-quality delivery for your business to live up to customer expectations. This is an assignment for your drivers who are attentive to detail and will go above and beyond for customers. As your team members won rsquo t actually be wearing the white gloves, these should be reliable, responsible drivers who value customer relationships. Choose people who communicate well and are accountable and timely. You also need people in these roles who can problem-solve when onsite with the customer. Challenges in delivering a white glove customer service To provide the best quality of service, you need to rely on your own team but also the customer. It may not sound logical, but for your drivers to be able to arrive, unload, unpack, and possibly assemble in a timely fashion, they need the customer to be available. If they can rsquo t take delivery when you want to provide it, that can lead to headaches. Think about the possible implications You might need to store that cargo. Drivers have to make a return trip. More trips mean more fuel and labor costs, plus added wear and tear on your vehicles. If the driver can rsquo t unload, they can rsquo t do another job. That missed delivery could be a big issue for the shipper too. They rsquo ve guaranteed a certain time frame. If they have to lose the customer rsquo s business, you can expect strained relationships with that supplier. Not to mention the damage to your own reputation with customers who expected top-notch service. There rsquo s one more challenge to be aware of if you rsquo re thinking of starting a white glove delivery service. Your team should be able to assemble items or even set up technology. That can require drivers with extra skills, which can make hiring more challenging. Why use Motive to organize your white glove delivery services?

            "Efficiency is top of mind for every truck driver and fleet manager. Inefficiency means losing time, fuel, and money. No one wants that. Projected time of availability PTA is a key factor to consider. Increase your efficiency by understanding and improving your PTA. What does PTA stand for in trucking and logistics? What does PTA mean in trucking and logistics ? PTA stands for projected time of availability. What PTA means to in trucking PTA helps the truck driver anticipate when they rsquo ll be available for another contract or shipment. Since drivers make their money transporting cargo, they want to keep their vehicles on the road as much as possible. But they need to rely on others to load and unload the cargo, and that can add time too. What PTA means to fleets Many factors play into PTA trucking considerations. Here rsquo s an example. A fleet manager is moving many drivers around a map with different cargos. The fleet manager needs to plan around each customer rsquo s pickup and drop-off times. Filling a truck at 10 a.m. with a load that can rsquo t be delivered until 3 p.m. means the PTA is after 3 p.m. It doesn rsquo t matter to PTA if the destination is 30 minutes away or three hours. But that difference makes a big impact on the business rsquo s bottom line. And the drivers rsquo frustration levels with dispatch. How to improve your PTA Better manage PTA logistics with the following strategies to keep everyone working with up-to-date information. nbsp Calculate Hours of Service Hours of Service HOS are regulated by The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA . These regulations limit the number of hours commercial drivers may drive and work per day and week and require mandatory breaks too. When estimating PTA the driver also needs to include breaks or sleeper times. For example, the 30-minute break requires drivers to take a consecutive 30-minute break if eight hours have passed. They can perform non-driving tasks without taking a break, but not drive again until the break is taken. Keeping track of HOS is easier with electronic logging devices . nbsp Use GPS for route optimizations Using GPS tracking for route optimization helps drivers carefully plan to avoid wasted time. GPS-based route optimization saves you from spending large periods of time manually calculating and inputting routes between stops. The driver can easily select a route with an open, empty truck stops along the way to ensure a break. They can also move to shorter routes or those with less traffic congestion to get to their destination faster. nbsp Fleet managers can input various addresses to deliver to, whether one day or across an extended period. They can also use advanced algorithms to accurately decide the most time-efficient routes. Dynamic routing makes PTA planning more adaptable with the power and accuracy of machine learning. Want to know more about truck route planning? Check out our route planning tips for drivers and fleets. Invest in vehicle diagnostics technology Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain or high heat can risk an overheated engine or other damages to a vehicle, which will lengthen the drivers rsquo PTA. These conditions can be unexpected. But with vehicle diagnostics technology , the driver and fleet management can better anticipate maintenance issues. A proactive approach to maintenance can increase vehicle uptime and reduce repair costs. An unsafe vehicle is also a driver and road safety risk. With a robust fleet management solution, you can keep track of vehicle inspection history in the same place as your in-vehicle diagnostics. Providing both drivers and fleet managers with visibility into vehicle health so they can address problem areas early. Get insights into warehouses and facilities A driver dispatch software can help fleet managers message drivers on the route to share info about warehouses and facilities. Fleet managers can make driver workflow simpler with details right in the dispatch about load information, addresses, pick up windows, and any special instructions. If details change, drivers can be updated via instant messaging in the software to avoid PTA calculation problems. Be aware of aspects that might lengthen your PTA Late arrival at a destination due to weather conditions or a traffic jam can negatively impact PTA. Poor communication can also lengthen PTA as a driver could arrive to pick up or drop off when no one is available at the customer rsquo s location. If you do run into an obstacle on a route, follow up with dispatch about your changing availability so they can plan around it. What is the difference between ETA and PTA? There can be some confusion about the difference between ETA and PTA. PTA means projected time of availability, and ETA means estimated time of arrival. To put it in clear terms, ETA is when you expect to arrive at your destination. PTA is when you rsquo ll be available to take on your next job. Drivers could arrive at their final destination 12 hours before they rsquo re available again. That rsquo s a critical distinction. After all, if a driver arrives at 7 p.m. to the customer rsquo s location but can rsquo t unload the cargo until 7 a.m., they won rsquo t be available until that rsquo s done. How Motive helps with PTA in trucking Motive has solutions for all your fleet management needs.

            "Today we know that road surface, tire inflation, and rolling resistance are important in vehicle fuel economy. This awareness has prompted the manufacture of low rolling resistance tires. This article discusses how low resistance tires work, the pros and cons, and other considerations for fleets looking to maintain these tires. What are low rolling resistance tires? The rolling resistance of the wheel impacts a vehicle rsquo s fuel consumption. Reducing rolling resistance cuts down on mechanical energy demand to reduce the amount of fuel sent to the engine. nbsp Low rolling resistance tires are designed to decrease the rolling effort of the vehicle. A National Transportation Board report found that ldquo the effect on total fuel consumption will depend on a number of factors, including the efficiency of the engine and driveline as well as the amount of energy used to power accessories. rdquo However, ldquo for most passenger vehicles, a 10 percent reduction in average rolling resistance over a period of time will lead to a 1 to 2 percent reduction in fuel consumption during that time. rdquo Best low rolling resistance tires for commercial vehicles The list of low rolling resistance commercial truck tires available is growing. The North American Council for Freight Efficiency noted in its 2020 Low Rolling Tire Confidence Report that the EPA SmartWay-verified tire list had inflated from eight offerings in 2010 to more than 300 as of 2020. nbsp With so many options available, finding the best tire for your needs can be challenging. Make your buying decision easier by reading these industry reviews TireDeets makes recommendations in a top 10 roundup. Tire Reviews and More offers a 10 Most Fuel Efficient Tires of 2022 . TireRack lets you search best low rolling resistance tires and offers reviews, tech articles, and videos. Tire Dealer Sites ranks the top eight low resistance tires. Can you get low rolling resistance truck tires? Yes, you can get low rolling resistance truck tires for trucks. Low rolling resistance truck tires make it easier for fleets to go green by reducing fuel consumption needs. Can you get low rolling resistance snow tires? You can also find low rolling resistance snow tires, which are a more recent development. However, some manufacturers now offer low rolling resistance winter tires that provide better traction on snow and ice while still offering improved fuel efficiency. What is the benefit of low rolling resistance tires? There are multiple ways that low resistance tires can save you money. Improved fuel efficiency You can measure low rolling resistance tires fuel savings using a rolling resistance calculator. These are offered by many of the top tire manufacturers, such as nbsp Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Michelin, and Yokohama Tire. Fleets can plug in details about current tires versus potential replacements, the number of trucks, and current fuel costs to determine savings per truck and more. In optimal conditions Fleet Owner reports , ldquo These tires can reduce a vehicle rsquo s fuel consumption by nbsp 6.28 . rdquo Better traction Low rolling tires help reduce road resistance, which means the engine expends less effort. At the same time, these tires are manufactured to improve traction. Cost savings Tires are a big expense for fleets. If you rsquo re asking, ldquo Do low resistance tires save money? rdquo the answer is yes. They have improved traction, and are made with higher quality material. While normal tires are manufactured with natural and synthetic rubbers, low resistance tires use traditional materials compounded with a mixture of silica, so the engine doesn rsquo t have to work as hard. That can lead to cost savings in terms of vehicle maintenance and the longevity of your investment in buying a truck . Sustainability nbsp Every bit of energy the commercial fleet saves, and fuel savings cut, translates to lowered carbon emissions too. That means choosing low rolling resistance tires also benefits your green logistics goals. What are the cons of low rolling resistance tires? Buying low rolling resistance tires isn rsquo t a standalone fuel economy solution. The tires are only going to get the best fuel efficiency with preventative maintenance. After all, ignoring tire health can lead not only to lowered fuel economy but also tire failures, which result in costly downtime. Shorter tread life Edmunds notes it rsquo s difficult to make categoric statements about the lifespan of one tire versus another. In Edmunds rsquo review of low rolling resistance tires, it states, ldquo Low-rolling-resistance tires can have less tread life than comparable conventional tires although some high-performance tires also have terribly short lives . rdquo Full inflation required As with any vehicle, it rsquo s important to regularly check the inflation of low rolling resistance tires for trucks. Drivers should at least do a visual pre- and post-trip check to ensure the truck tire is properly inflated. nbsp Checking truck tire inflation pressure and alignment also has value. Tire tread depth is another maintenance factor to regularly monitor. nbsp Try these four best ways to maintain your tires . How to use Motive to improve your fuel efficiency Low rolling resistance tires can support greater fuel efficiency. But they rsquo re not the only answer. ldquo A fleet must take a holistic approach, rdquo says Helmut Keller, Continental rsquo s Head of Brand and Product Management for Commercial Vehicle Tires in the Americas region. ldquo Driver behavior, routing, proper tire pressure management, and other factors also heavily influence a vehicle rsquo s fuel economy. rdquo Here rsquo s how Motive rsquo s fleet management software can help Increase fuel efficiency with improved visibility into fuel consumption . nbsp Use dash cam technology to help coach drivers avoid behaviors that negatively impact roll resistance e.g., speeding, hard braking . Improve routing with GPS tracking software and keep track of all your assets. Ensure proper tire management with maintenance tools , so fleet managers stay updated on retreading and tire replacement needs.

            "Many companies rely on dash cams to protect their business and promote safe driving habits . But not all drivers are on board. While most drivers understand the value of a road-facing camera, many still consider driver-facing cameras quite intrusive. So how can companies implement dual-facing dash cams without losing their drivers rsquo trust? nbsp In a recent webinar , two Motive experts partnered with Freight Waves to discuss how choosing an AI-powered dash cam can help companies find the balance between promoting safety and protecting privacy. Here are some key takeaways from their discussion. Prevent accidents with the Motive AI Dashcam. How do AI dash cams promote safety? Accidents happen, but 87 of them are preventable . In the webinar, Motive rsquo s Director of Product Management Abhishek Gupta discussed how the right AI-powered dash cam should help you predict and prevent accidents by detecting unsafe behaviors like Cell phone use Close following Seat belt use Rolling stops Distracted driving Harsh driving The Motive AI Dashcam can accurately detect unsafe behaviors 89 of the time . That rsquo s more than Lytx 61 and significantly more than Samsara 15 . Once the behavior is detected, the Motive AI Dashcam automatically provides personalized, video-based coaching within the Motive Driver App. Saving your safety department time and helping your drivers improve. How can AI dash cams protect driver privacy? Most drivers don rsquo t want dual-facing dash cams because they don rsquo t want ldquo spyware rdquo in their vehicle. And that rsquo s understandable. But there are dash cams on the market with key features to promote driver privacy. For example, the Motive AI Dashcam gives drivers the option to disable the driver-facing camera while they rsquo re off duty. Admins can activate Driver Privacy Mode for the entire company, a group, or an individual driver. Motive automatically enables Driver Privacy Mode when the engine is off and during sleeper berth status. How can companies get driver buy-in on dual-facing dash cams? In our recent webinar, Motive rsquo s Head of Regulatory Affairs Travis Baskin discussed the seven steps each company can take to get driver buy-in on dash cams . Each step is important, but the sixth step to ldquo Find champions rdquo is very key. Because drivers trust other drivers. So if you can find drivers who understand the benefits of dual-facing dash cams, encourage them to champion the cause and share their thoughts with other drivers. Here rsquo s a short video of three drivers doing just that Watch the webinar recording to hear the full discussion around how AI dash cams can promote safety while protecting driver privacy.

            "As Baby Boomers retire from the transportation industry in large numbers, the exodus is contributing to a drive r shortage that the ATA puts near 80,000. The next generation of drivers should be waiting in the wings, but they rsquo ve sought a better work-life balance elsewhere. So fleets must work harder to retain drivers , and to keep them motivated and safe. Fortunately, there rsquo s a way to accomplish all of this at once. It rsquo s called a safety incentive program, and it rsquo s the key to improving driver safety . nbsp Helpful tips for planning a driver incentive program First, clearly define what your incentive program should achieve. Here are five suggestions to help you prioritize as you plan a driver incentive program. 1. Set strategic goals nbsp Before taking the first step, know the intended outcomes. If reducing collisions is the goal, you could build incentives to increase following distance , eliminate cell phone use, or practice safe speeds . Whichever behaviors you focus on, driver incentives should support the fleet rsquo s overall safety mission and align with corporate goals. In a recent blog post , American Family Insurance reports that before launching an incentive program, ldquo management must assure that the organization has the proper equipment, hiring procedures, training programs, supervision techniques, and record keeping in place ndash the basic components of a well-managed fleet safety program . rdquo 2. Keep it simple nbsp As with any new initiative, the easier a driver incentive program is to understand and act upon, the greater the chances of success. ldquo Keep incentive programs simple, be straightforward with ground rules, and communicate those rules to all employees, rdquo Safety Health Magazine advises . When fleet safety incentive programs are too complicated, they fail before even making an impact. Start with the big picture and build goals around it. Simplifying the incentive program makes it easy for managers to administer and drivers to follow. 3. Use data from safety technology to decide which behaviors to incentivize The Motive AI Dashcam captures video of unsafe driving behaviors, then automatically uploads them to a fleet rsquo s Safety Hub for follow-up. In designing an incentive program, look for videos in the Safety Hub marked ldquo high severity rdquo or ldquo critical. rdquo Let the unsafe behaviors in those videos direct your focus. nbsp If texting and driving is a problem in your fleet, consider an incentive that gives drivers points for each day they don rsquo t reach for their phone. Drivers could use those points to buy gear and electronics from the company store. Short-term goals are more likely than annual awards to inspire a change in behavior. When designing a driver incentive program, aim for short-term incentives that are easy to track. 4. Gain buy-in from top brass so drivers buy in too nbsp When the message about a new driver incentive program comes from the CEO, managers and drivers will take the program seriously. Executive support bolsters the program rsquo s credibility. 5. Communicate expectations nbsp Launching a driver incentive program is similar to rolling out new safety technology. Transparency is the key to obtaining driver acceptance. When launching an incentive program, explain to drivers why you chose to incentivize safety. Have there been too many near misses lately? Too many accidents? Share those details with the team. Make sure drivers can see how their performance compares to their peers. Also educate them on how their performance is measured. A little friendly competition can motivate drivers even more. Creative tips for keeping drivers engaged in safety nbsp Once a safety incentive program has launched, fleet and safety managers will be responsible for keeping it fresh, fun, and motivating. Here are proven ways to keep drivers invested in safe performance. 1. Diversify rewards nbsp Though it may be tempting to reward drivers with cash all the time, it rsquo s best to offer a combination of rewards. According to American Family Insurance , ldquo While the first thought for providing rewards may be to provide cash incentives, many organizations avoid this as they feel it does not provide lasting recognition. On the other hand, many organizations have found a combination of cash and company merchandise works well. rdquo nbsp Diversifying will keep your driver incentive program fresh and drivers engaged. Allocating different levels of recognition to various achievements will also set larger accomplishments apart from smaller ones. 2. Give timely praise nbsp Positive feedback given shortly after a safety achievement is most impactful. When safe actions are rewarded and reinforced promptly, it sends the message that safety is valued and important. When rewards are closely tied to specific driving behaviors, such as leaving space around the vehicle, reasonable speeds, or safe lane changes, drivers will begin to associate those behaviors with positive recognition. Waiting too long to reward excellence or improvement may confuse drivers who may not remember the details of an event weeks later. For praise to be most effective, Inc. magazine writes , ldquo do it immediately. You re going to lessen the impact of the praise if you wait too long. rdquo 3. Praise drivers publicly Public recognition can motivate drivers to perform their best, so look for opportunities to acknowledge drivers before their peers. Many fleets celebrate their most improved performers during safety meetings, or host awards banquets for their safest employees. Others list the month rsquo s top drivers in the breakroom. nbsp ldquo Social recognition can be even more meaningful to employees than tangible rewards, rdquo writes Kellie Wong in an incentives article for Achievers.com . ldquo Even a simple lsquo thank you rsquo can be enough to keep someone motivated. rdquo 4. Gamify driver incentives to make them fun nbsp A trophy that makes the rounds with the company rsquo s safest drivers. A points system that lets drivers buy cool company swag. A commemorative wrap for a driver rsquo s vehicle. They rsquo re all creative ways to show appreciation for safe drivers. nbsp Gamification takes the principles of board games and video games and applies them to the workplace. Some fleets reward drivers for going a certain number of miles without an accident. Others give on-the-spot bonuses for avoiding a collision. There are countless ways to gamify incentives, so go ahead and get creative with them. Use metrics from your AI-powered safety platform to show that a driver is improving and worthy of recognition. When looking for drivers to acknowledge, Motive rsquo s DRIVE risk score can help. Drivers with excellent scores are listed in deep blue in the Safety Hub. As your team rsquo s strongest performers, they should be rewarded. When incentivizing drivers for improvement, you could reward drivers who advance from fair to good. 5. Give drivers visibility into their performance Access and visibility have become sources of validation for drivers. Especially since the alternative is to be left out. Drivers like to feel part of a larger mission, and giving them insight into their performance helps achieve that. nbsp ldquo Giving employees visibility into company goals and hard data sends a message that they rsquo re a trusted and integral part of the team, rdquo writes BrightGauge, a data management platform. ldquo It gives them a sense of ownership and accountability over their work. rdquo nbsp When a driver takes quick action to avoid an accident , for example, video captured by Motive rsquo s AI Dashcam is automatically uploaded to the Motive Driver App for the driver rsquo s review later. Having video proof of the incident backs up the driver rsquo s side of the story and brings their bravery to light. The driver rsquo s manager can then share the driver rsquo s achievement with the broader team, inspiring everyone. View the 2023 Driver App updates . 6. Make driver incentives meaningful nbsp If a driver goes above and beyond for safety, the company should go above and beyond too. Gift cards and company apparel are great for honoring everyday achievements. For drivers who reach 100,000 safe miles or go years without a blemish on their record, a special memento should set the accomplishment apart. Choose something that speaks to the drivers rsquo achievements and the value of safety . Road safety can be a matter of life and death, so show your team their actions matter. When you put thought and care into your driver incentive program, your drivers will put more care into driving. nbsp Protect your drivers and your bottom line Use the power of AI to enhance fleet safety . Learn about the Motive AI Dashcam and how it can become an important piece of your driver incentive program.\n",

            "From the pandemic rsquo s frontlines to supply chain breakdowns, commercial fleets have had a rough couple of years, and labor shortages in construction and trucking have played a central role. The American Trucking Associations says about 80,000 drivers need to be hired for the industry to run at its best. At C amp K Holdings in Chicago, Illinois, 1,200 drivers and 350 employees are feeling the pinch. ldquo For us, the labor issue is one of the biggest concerns, rdquo says Mike Burton, CEO at C amp K Holdings, the parent company of C amp K Trucking. ldquo Challenges we rsquo re having with the labor market are the worst we rsquo ve seen in 20 years. rdquo nbsp The good news is, a lot can be done to ease the workforce challenges that C amp K Trucking and other companies are facing. Motive rsquo s webinar ldquo How to pivot your workforce development strategy rdquo explores these challenges and presents meaningful solutions to them. nbsp Listen to the webinar here . nbsp Don rsquo t have time to listen? Here rsquo s a recap of the session rsquo s key takeaways. nbsp High turnover increases the pressure to retain employees C amp K Trucking rsquo s turnover rate this year stands at 80 , higher than the 50 and 60 it normally is. About 20 of C amp K rsquo s drivers have been lured away to the spot market, where rates are strong. Other drivers have left to get their DOT authority. nbsp As C amp K Trucking looks to onboard talent and develop their workforce long term, they continue to encounter roadblocks. ldquo The Great Resignation has impacted us, rdquo Burton says. ldquo We rsquo ve struggled from an employee retention standpoint. Those struggles are relatively new to us, and it rsquo s difficult to find the answers. rdquo Connect with young talent earlier The pandemic changed the way the world works. ldquo Now employees expect a better work-life balance, whether they work remotely or part-time in the office, rdquo says Jennifer Kolb, VP of Business Development at Tallo, a solutions provider for all phases of workforce development. Younger generations, especially, seek a balanced lifestyle. And though workforce issues will continue into the near future, Kolb says there rsquo s reason to be hopeful. nbsp A Tallo survey of Gen Z rsquo s perspective of trucking and logistics showed that 29,000 Gen Z expressed interest in working in trucking, distribution, and logistics. And while that amount isn rsquo t big enough to solve the labor shortage overnight, it presents a great opportunity for commercial fleets to tap into prospective talent currently in high school and college. nbsp ldquo Gen Z prefers to hear from employers before a job becomes available, much like athletic recruiting, rdquo Kolb says. ldquo You should be building your brand right now. Realize how important it is for early talent to know about opportunities sooner. rdquo That rsquo s important, considering that 55 of Gen Z respondents in Tallo rsquo s survey say they plan to stay at their first employer for three years or more. ldquo You have to reach out to them early or you won rsquo t get them for another three to five years, rdquo Kolb says. ldquo Think about that. If the people coming in at the entry-level plan to stay for three or more years, employers in the transportation industry have to be open to bringing them on early. Gen Z values loyalty, so they will stay. rdquo Watch the full webinar here to learn how your fleet can connect with young talent earlier and make them part of your team.\n",

            "Sustainability efforts have changed vehicle manufacturing. Manufacturers are now installing catalytic converters in some vehicles to help remove toxins from emissions. But the converters require precious metals that are in high demand, leading to an uptick of catalytic converter thefts. This article will discuss the issue and share catalytic converter theft prevention tips. Why do people steal catalytic converters? Catalytic converters have been fitted to gas-powered vehicles since 1992, and on diesel-fueled vehicles starting in 2001. But catalytic theft prevention is stealing more headlines now. Why? The precious metals in these converters have gone up in value. Scrap metal dealers will pay for three metals the catalytic converter needs to remove toxins from vehicle emissions Platinum Palladium nbsp Rhodium These valuable metals are a hot commodity. In fact, the prices for even an ounce of one of these three materials has increased by hundreds of dollars in recent years. Thieves only need a wrench or saw to remove what they rsquo re after. They can slide under the vehicle and leave you without a catalytic converter in just a few minutes. nbsp How much is a stolen catalytic converter worth? The value of a stolen catalytic converter will depend on the vehicle it comes from. GuideOne Insurance reports, ldquo Scrap metal dealers will pay close to 100 for the typical catalytic converter. However, the metals found in some exotic and foreign car models can fetch more money, even up to 400. rdquo Which vehicles are targeted for catalytic converter theft? Any vehicle with a catalytic converter is at risk. However, thieves are more likely to target vehicles with a higher clearance, such as SUVs, vans, buses, and trucks. A higher clearance makes it easier for them to get under the vehicle and get away with the goods quicker. Hybrids, such as the Toyota Prius, are top targets. Foreign car models can also be at higher risk as the metals can net more money for the thieves. Older model vehicles can be targeted more as well since newer models have catalytic converters that use a lower quantity of precious metals. How much is a new catalytic converter? nbsp The cost of replacing a catalytic converter depends on the quality of the converter and your vehicle type. Cash for Clunkers puts the average replacement cost in the 1,000- 2,500 range. A commercial fleet will also lose efficiency while the vehicle is repaired and the converter is replaced. It rsquo s not illegal to drive without a catalytic converter, but your vehicle won rsquo t function as well. You rsquo ll also undermine fuel economy efforts . nbsp How to know if a catalytic converter is stolen Some common signs include loud noises, especially when starting or accelerating, as the exhaust is now unregulated. Worst case scenario is you rsquo ll realize you rsquo re without the converter when you fail your annual vehicle emissions inspection. nbsp Note If the authorities find out you rsquo re driving without a catalytic converter, you could be fined. What to do if a catalytic converter is stolen Of course, you rsquo ll do all you can to prevent catalytic converter theft. However, if a catalytic converter is stolen Report the theft to police. Contact your insurer. Replace your converter. Consider calling other businesses in your area to raise community awareness. Does insurance cover catalytic converter theft? If your insurance policy covers theft, you rsquo re likely covered for catalytic converter theft, but you rsquo ll have to cover the deductible. GuideOne states, On average, the repair cost from this type of theft is about 1,500. However, this cost does not include your deductible, which can be anywhere between 250 to 1,000. rdquo At that rate, it can be more cost-effective to invest in catalytic converter theft protection. How to prevent catalytic converter theft The following strategies can help you prevent catalytic converter theft Park defensively Park vehicles with catalytic converters in locked garages. If that isn rsquo t possible, leave the vehicle somewhere highly visible. Since organized catalytic converter thieves will target repair shops and parking lots with fleets of vehicles, avoid parking in these after dark. Blocking access to the underside of the vehicle, particularly at the exhaust end where the catalytic converter is located, can also help. Secure fleet parking Live video surveillance cameras can help deter criminals. Even effective lighting can reduce the chances that crooks will target your vehicle fleet parking lots. Fencing the fleet parking lot also adds a layer of security. Weld bolted catalytic converters Experienced thieves can remove a catalytic converter with a saw or wrench. You can deter the ones who use wrenches if you weld the bolts of a bolted catalytic converter. The bad guys with saws will still be able to get at your metals, but you rsquo ll at least cut down on the likelihood of theft. Etch the converter Etching a unique identifier onto the catalytic converter can deter thieves as it may stop garages from buying the converter. The number helps to identify stolen converters. It also helps to put a sticker in the vehicle window announcing the converter is marked with an identifier. Add protective coverings You can buy a protective device e.g., a CatClamp to help deter thieves. You rsquo ll strap a hardened steel cover over the potential cutting area to make it more difficult for thieves to remove the converter. Geofencing Take advantage of digital technology and draw a geofence around the trailer to alert you if it moves. With Motive rsquo s geofence alerts, users can receive emails when the vehicle enters or exits a geofence. The information will include the time, date, geofence name, geofence category, and asset ID to support your asset tracking and theft protection efforts. How to keep your commercial vehicles safe with Motive There rsquo s little doubt that asset tracking can help you prevent catalytic converter theft. Motive rsquo s Asset Gateway s provides visibility into both live or historical asset locations, making it easier for fleets to prevent theft or misuse. Fleet managers can also draw virtual boundaries around vehicles and be alerted whenever that asset crosses a geofence .

            "Rising materials costs, a historic labor shortage, a fragmented supply chain . Challenges for the construction industry haven rsquo t exactly been scarce. Adding to these issues is the exodus of 1 million workers that took place during the pandemic shutdown. Through it all, today rsquo s firms have found ways to cope. Investments in technology have helped keep operations moving, and for many, these investments are starting to pay off. nbsp An OpenAsset survey on current construction trends shows that of the 500 architecture, engineering, and construction professionals surveyed, 78 feel well-positioned to grow and 81 plan to implement technology in the near future. Respondents intend to use new technology to win business, meet deadlines, and be more productive. ldquo It rsquo s exciting to see technology move into construction, rdquo says Jason Janicki, Chief Operating Officer at OpenAsset. ldquo The survey results show that construction companies are starting to change the way they work. rdquo nbsp Here are seven tech trends that are helping firms work better, faster, smarter. 1. The integration of ERP, CRM, and marketing automation tools Enterprise resource planning ERP , customer relationship management CRM , and marketing automation tools. They rsquo re all top of the list for contractors looking to work faster and smarter. But be forewarned, using these tools individually isn rsquo t enough. ldquo Companies are looking for ways to integrate ERP, CRM , and marketing automation tools to become more efficient, rdquo Janicki explains. ldquo The construction industry is starting to move away from siloed systems that don rsquo t talk to each other. As contractors compare tools and platforms, they rsquo ll need to consider how new technology investments will fit with existing platforms. rdquo nbsp At Chicago-based Clune Construction , integration into client-facing platforms is underway. Clune has merged its ERP software with its CRM so that project managers, superintendents, and accountants can work together in one platform. nbsp Complete projects on time and on budget with Motive. ldquo We rsquo re planning to push some of that information out to a client portal so that customers can see it too, rdquo says Denise Moy Duffy, Clune rsquo s Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications. ldquo Everything will be open and transparent for clients in terms of project management and finances. Customers will be able to see where each dollar is going in real time. rdquo ldquo The point of ERP and CRM integration is to ensure that automated and consistent information is shared between both systems, creating a single source of truth, rdquo writes Cleo, an integration cloud platform . ldquo When an ERP and CRM are integrated, you have an accurate view of customer information once an order has been made. rdquo 2. The Internet of Things IoT , telematics, and optical character recognition OCR integration IoT, telematics, and OCR are changing the way construction firms work, and they rsquo re doing it together. nbsp IoT is a network of devices connected to the internet and each other. When smartphones, wearables, and other devices communicate with each other through the internet, a safer, more automated workforce is possible. IoT sensors can be integrated into a fleet management platform, allowing telematics to sort data more quickly. ldquo This gives businesses near-real-time visibility into key metrics like fuel consumption, engine status, vehicle location, driver behavior, and vehicle maintenance history, rdquo writes the technology content platform KnowledgeNile. For example, with Motive rsquo s ability to connect vehicles, drivers, and the corporate office , construction firms can streamline access to critical project information. When everyone is aligned on a project, it leads to better collaboration and productivity. And because Motive connects with virtually any third-party software vendor, fleets can reap the benefits of Motive while using their existing systems. ldquo Construction sites are seeing far more automation and digitization of the job site, rdquo observes Christian Burger , President and Founder of Burger Consulting Group. ldquo That rsquo s what rsquo s getting interesting about all this. We rsquo re not just automating accounts payable, estimating, or billing anymore. We rsquo re getting into much more of an environmental process, looking at job site productivity. That rsquo s where the tech investment is going to have much bigger returns for construction. rdquo 3. Tracking productivity As job site productivity comes into focus, firms are relying on job tracking software to work faster. It rsquo s helping them solve problems in real time, stay on schedule, and conserve costs. ldquo The construction industry has struggled to keep up with the production of units, rdquo says Burger. ldquo Whether it rsquo s feet of conduit or cubic yards of concrete, we haven rsquo t had good tools for productivity. Now technology is allowing us to capture production in the field, report it back, and give feedback to foremen in the field about how they performed that day. I rsquo m encouraged by technology that tracks productivity. It rsquo s one of the things that rsquo s been missing, and it will help contractors almost immediately. rdquo Tools like Procore rsquo s project management software or Raken rsquo s production tracking software make it easy for firms to understand how efficiently crews are working. Teams can record labor hours, cost codes, and other details right from a mobile device. Tracking software can automatically calculate efficiency rates and time to completion, making it easier for firms to identify risks and solve problems early. 4. The shift to a hybrid workforce Only 15 of OpenAsset survey respondents plan to return to the office full time, Janicki says. ldquo That rsquo s why ensuring that work gets done efficiently outside of the office, and collaborating with people inside and outside the office, is becoming very important in construction. rdquo As soon as Clune Construction employees knew they rsquo d have to leave the office for the COVID-19 shutdown, the firm switched to Microsoft Teams, a platform that allows for workspace chat, videoconferencing, and file storage. At the time, Clune had an instant messaging service but no way to share documents or view items as a team. nbsp ldquo Because we were on Microsoft 365 and Sharepoint already, moving to another Microsoft product was easy, rdquo Duffy says. ldquo Tools that allow for remote and hybrid work will be vital for communications in the future, especially as new generations join construction teams. rdquo nbsp 5. Monitoring job site safety On today rsquo s construction sites, productivity and safety go hand in hand. When companies compromise safety for productivity, it often comes at a hefty price. nbsp ldquo Thinking that safety can be ignored in production is akin to saying that efficiency and the cost of production don t matter, rdquo writes EHS Today magazine . ldquo A safety mishap can impact both the volume and cost of production like few other things can. The small gains made in production by shortcutting safety seem to be worthwhile until an accident occurs. Then the gains disappear or even become losses in many cases. rdquo As construction firms note the close connection between safety, productivity, and profitability, an important trend has emerged. ldquo Video monitoring for hard hats, fall protection, and safety vests is becoming more common, rdquo Burger says. ldquo Wearable devices are letting us know where workers are at any given time, so that if a track hoe is backing up, the operator knows that someone is behind it. rdquo By detecting falls, monitoring body temperature, and sending alerts, wearables can also protect workers from overheating and fatigue. Safety solutions that use artificial intelligence AI and computer vision are in demand for their ability to improve safety in real time. A Forbes article explains the impact AI is having on construction safety. ldquo Increasingly, construction sites are being equipped with cameras, IoT devices, and sensors that monitor many aspects of construction operations, rdquo Forbes writes. Motive rsquo s AI Dashcam , for example, empowers contractors to make informed decisions in the most critical moments. The AI Dashcam notifies contractors of unsafe driving actions as they happen so that drivers can take corrective action. nbsp The AI Dashcam works to prevent accidents, safeguard lives, and reduce liability. As Forbes writes, ldquo with facial recognition and object recognition technology, AI systems are capable of detecting unsafe behavior and alerting the construction team of potential hazards. Not only does this reduce liability, but it can save lives and increase efficiency. rdquo Another area where tech is improving safety is with wearables. ldquo By integrating wearable devices and their data with cloud-based software, companies can facilitate instant communication between managers and field workers, rdquo writes For Construction Pros magazine. Smartwatches, augmented reality glasses, and wearable sensors are improving workplace safety. Just as importantly, they rsquo re opening critical lines of communication and revealing important data insights. 6. Digital asset management Remote work is here to stay. Employees need an efficient way to manage assets, including videos, PDFs, and design files. When assets aren rsquo t managed correctly, it can take hours for employees to find what they need. nbsp ldquo A digital asset management system is absolutely necessary when managing a hybrid or remote workforce, rdquo Duffy says. ldquo It adds a much-needed level of organization and accessibility to digital assets. rdquo The concise organization that digital asset management provides can be pivotal in protecting firms from litigation. ldquo Companies can really up their game when it comes to digital asset management, rdquo Burger says. ldquo The expense of legal discovery has plagued firms for a long time. If you don rsquo t have good records management practices and systems to support record management, then getting a discovery notice can be a very expensive and risky proposition. rdquo nbsp Companies are realizing that poor organization of assets is a huge risk. Publicly traded firms have been faster to tighten up their records. ldquo But private firms have been slow to get there, rdquo Burger says. ldquo The idea of content management was perhaps not foremost in their minds, and now with the explosion of digital content, content management is a priority. rdquo 7. Hiring tech-savvy teams Even with all the focus on equipment, Burger sees an emerging trend developing in construction staffing. Business analysts. nbsp ldquo About 10 years ago, the notion of a business analyst was seen as an overhead item and a luxury, rdquo Burger says. ldquo Today more companies are hiring them. The business analyst is basically a level of assurance that your investment in technology is actually going to provide significant returns. Business analysts can help build out training or testing material if need be. And yes, I would say it rsquo s a full-time role. rdquo While Clune doesn rsquo t have a business analyst, they have something equally important. A tech-testing committee. nbsp Made up of about 80 volunteers from across the company, the volunteers sit on various committees to test technologies the company is considering. For example, someone on the Apple committee would test out iPhones, iPads, and new software updates. nbsp Clune has teams that test augmented reality and virtual reality tech, software programs, and patches for ERP or CRM systems. nbsp ldquo If the technology is doing what we hope it will do, then the committee can push it out to the masses and talk about how much they like it, rdquo Duffy says. ldquo We rsquo re building internal champions this way. It helps ease the fear of trying something new. Our employees know that someone has used it and understands how it works. So there rsquo s always someone on the committee to go to for help. rdquo Are you looking to onboard new technology? Motive has a solution for you.

            "Not every shipper in North America fills their entire trailer with freight, but it doesn rsquo t mean items are left sitting in a warehouse. Instead, shippers take advantage of LTL shipping. Shipping LTL has benefits for the shipper as well as the fleets transporting the freight. What does LTL shipping mean? Less than truckload LTL shipping transports freight that doesn rsquo t fill an entire trailer. The shipment can start as low as 100 pounds. The shipper reduces costs by paying only for the portion of the trailer that their shipment takes up. Other LTL shippers cover the cost of using the remaining space. What is the difference between LTL and FTL freight? FTL freight refers to a full truckload. Whereas an LTL shipment might be 500 or 5,000 pounds, FTL shipment tends to be much larger, often weighing 20,000 pounds or more . These kinds of shipments fill all or most of the truck. nbsp LTL typically costs less as the shipments are smaller, and the shipper only pays for the space used. However, LTL can take longer as there are more delivery stops . How does LTL shipping work? With LTL shipping, partial loads are put together to create a full truckload. This type of shipping often operates on a hub and spoke model. Local terminals are the spokes and distribution centers or larger terminals are the hubs. The commercial truck company will charge based on Space. The amount of space being used is based on dimensions and weight. Class of items. Shipments requiring special handling will cost more. Pickup and destination locations. The further the location, the higher the price. The company may provide standard, expedited, or guaranteed shipping. Customers might also ask for services such as a lift gate, inside or residential pickup delivery, and reweighing reclassification. How long does LTL shipping take? LTL shipping times vary. This method can be quicker as the shipper doesn rsquo t have to wait to fill an entire truck load. At the same time, if the fleet carrier is waiting for other loads going to the same destination or at least the same direction , it can take longer. LTL freight delivery can also take longer as each truck will have to make a greater number of stops at many nearby locations. An LTL shipment can always be expedited, but requires an additional fee for the service. Customers can make their LTL shipment more efficient by Providing accurate dimensions for shipments to help carriers maximize capacity nbsp Completing accurate bill of lading before carriers arrive Loading goods onto pallets with heavy items on the bottom and labels visible to protect and help track shipments Benefits of LTL shipping As already discussed, LTL shipping reduces costs for the shipper. Instead of paying full truck freight, the shipper only pays for the space they use in the truck. The lowered cost is particularly appealing to small businesses that need to ship fewer goods, but still want to meet customer expectations for delivery arrival times. Additionally, LTL shipping can increase security of the freight. Carriers often offer tracking capabilities so customers stay updated on the location of their shipment. Also, nbsp most LTL shipments are packaged on pallets before truck loading, which helps keep smaller units more secure as they rsquo re moved in larger units. LTL shipping is also a more sustainable approach to shipping, since there are more trucks running optimized routes and carrying full loads. Both the fleet and shippers can manage their carbon footprint by cutting emissions. Challenges of LTL shipping LTL shipping involves more logistics awareness . Each shipper needs to give carriers accurate information about the freight class, weight, pickup and destination locations, and deadline for optimized route planning. Even though commercial fleets offer full truckload services, only some make their vehicles available for LTL shipments. This means it can take longer to find an LTL carrier at the right price. Factors that affect LTL shipping rates LTL shipping rates are impacted by the same factors that impact shipping costs overall. Factors include manufacturing, payroll employment, retail sales, and housing construction. Each of these plays a role in the amount of cargo volume on the demand side. The number of trailers available and truck drivers to deliver the cargo impact supply. For instance, the March 2022 State of Freight report from FTR Transportation Intelligence reported a ldquo surge in new trucking companies. rdquo The current surge began in 2020, with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA authorizing 165,000 for-hire carriers since July 2020. nbsp No matter the number of trucking companies, freight can only move if there are drivers available to take the routes. The initial ELD mandate, which strictly enforce the Hours of Service HOS regulations, may have had an initial depressive impact on driver productivity. However, with the transition to ELD technology , fleets are better aware of how to acquire the right freight and increase revenue per truck. How to track LTL shipments with Motive Keeping track of many smaller loads for multiple shippers in one truck adds layers of complexity to fleet logistics. Fleet management software can help simplify a commercial truck company rsquo s LTL offerings. Real-time fleet tracking lets fleet managers know where all drivers, vehicles, equipment, and trailers are at any given moment. The GPS tracking tool allows you to not only see the asset rsquo s location but also the drivers rsquo HOS and other factors in a single screen. If a safety event, road conditions, or loading or unloading slow a truck on its route, you can notify customers of any delays. nbsp The dispatch and workflow software also allows fleet managers to stay updated on when a fleet arrives or departs with instant email alerts. Use automated reporting to see vehicle capacity, and find the closest drivers to a pickup location to make LTL dispatch efficient and easy. nbsp LTL carriers can also save time and money with documentation done through the Motive App to give proof of delivery and validate work immediately. nbsp Drivers appreciate the technology as well. Motive helps make documentation easier. Plus, drivers receive full load information including addresses, pickup windows, cargo details, and special instructions. If the dispatch is canceled or updated, they rsquo ll know right away. Want to do more with LTL shipping? Learn how Motive rsquo s fleet management software can help. Ask for a demo today .\n",

            "The days of the dirty diesel-fueled delivery or distribution truck may be numbered. Internal combustion engines ICE are still being made, but electric vehicles are on the line too. From big rigs to box trucks, and semi-trucks to delivery vans, there are many options for electric vehicle EV fleets. This article discusses ICEs and EVs, the advantages of electric vehicle fleets, and tips for switching to EVs, including how to implement electric vehicle fleet management. The history of electric vehicles You might expect an electric vehicle history to begin a few decades ago, but the first small-scale electric cars were developed in the 1830s. Robert Anderson developed the first rudimentary, electric-powered vehicle in 1832. It wasn rsquo t until the 1870s that electric cars became more practical. Still, it took another 20 years for real interest in electric vehicles to take hold. By the 20th century, electric vehicles accounted for ldquo a third of all vehicles on the road, rdquo according to the Department of Energy . Porsche developed the first hybrid electric car in 1901. In the next decade, the Model T emerged as the more affordable alternative. Gas-powered vehicles continued unchallenged until the 1970s when gas prices soared. The urgency to switch to alternative fuels slowed as fuel prices stabilized until the 1990s. Due to rising awareness of the impact of carbon emissions on the environment, electric vehicles became a cleaner, more attractive option for drivers. What are commercial electric vehicles used for? The early adopters of electric vehicle fleets were municipal and government agencies with a large number of sedans in service. More buses and public transportation vehicles are going electric too. nbsp Now, as the national infrastructure evolves to support electric charging, electric vehicles are used for regional and last-mile routes. There is still a lot of room for electric vehicle fleet growth, as ldquo the largest percentage of goods by weight and value rdquo in the United States moves ldquo relatively short distances, rdquo according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics . ldquo Approximately 67.1 percent of the weight and 51.8 percent of the value of goods moved less than 250 miles between origin and destination in 2018. rdquo What are the benefits of electric vehicles in fleets? Electric vehicle battery life A key benefit for the fleet is electric vehicle battery life. When powered by regenerative braking, the battery recharges using the kinetic energy released with the vehicle brakes. Today, a lithium-ion battery cell can last 2,000 and 3,000 cycles and up to 10 years. The technology is only improving, so expect the battery cost and size to decrease and the longevity to improve. Low maintenance nbsp Ease of maintenance is one of the many benefits to electric vehicles. Since electric vehicles are electrically powered, there rsquo s no need to lubricate the engines, unlike a combustion engine. At the same time, ldquo charging infrastructure and after-sales services, such as the number of EV-trained technicians, are also improving, rdquo according to Energy Saving Trust . Environmental benefits A big advantage of an electric vehicle fleet is sustainability. Vehicles with an electrically powered engine don rsquo t release toxic gasses into the environment. Electric vehicles can reduce your organization rsquo s carbon footprint, which means you and your drivers contribute to a healthier climate. While we rsquo re thinking about pollution, let rsquo s mention that electric vehicle fleets also produce less noise pollution. Electric motors make for quiet, smooth-driving vehicles. nbsp Cost-effectiveness An electric vehicle fleet might be more expensive on the front end, but there rsquo s a reduced total cost of ownership TCO over the life cycle of the vehicle. For one, fuel costs are a major drain on the fleet rsquo s bottom line. It rsquo s estimated that 30 of operating costs are attributable to fuel. With an electric fleet, the operator can power commercial vehicles with less costly electricity. nbsp Electric vehicles have lower maintenance costs due to fewer service requirements including oils and filters and reduced wear and tear on brakes. Your organization may also benefit from government incentives such as grants or tax breaks, which are intended to make an investment in this transformation more attractive. nbsp Range of electric vehicle brands Among electric vehicle brands, Tesla may be the best known. It has two semis one with a 300-mile range and another boasting 300-500 miles. However, Elon Musk rsquo s company isn rsquo t the only one in the market. Electric nbsp medium-duty trucks, step vans, nbsp and pickup trucks also get a lot of coverage . Vehicles in nbsp these nbsp weight classes nbsp tend to travel less than 150 miles per day and return to base each evening. nbsp Trucks with longer ranges remain in production. Nikola Motors predicts a range of 500-700 miles for its trucks. Amazon rsquo s electric delivery truck from Rivian is now slated to launch in 2022, but the range remains confidential. Volvo is keeping its range under wraps too. nbsp Of course, there are several variables that impact range, such as driving speed, vehicle, and weather conditions . The question of range will remain difficult to answer until manufacturers disclose more information. Should you transition to an electric vehicle fleet? More fleet and transit owners are exploring a clean transportation journey, according to Mortenson , a developer and engineering services provider. Based on a survey of 200 transportation professionals, the company predicts 48 of fleets will be clean in five to seven years and that ldquo electric fleets are the preferred option. rdquo Organizational goals, emerging technologies, and environmental responsibility are the key drivers for the transformation to electric vehicle fleets. In fact, Mortenson rsquo s research suggests 23 of fleets are already clean. Clean fleet owners cited ldquo zero emissions, innovation, and customer preference rdquo as the reasons they preferred electric vehicles. Falling battery costs make electric fleet vehicles more affordable. At the same time, there are government incentives and mandates for zero-emission trucks, so more manufacturers are rolling out electric vehicles in the United States. nbsp Self-driving trucks , though,are still at least a decade away. How to manage an electric vehicle fleet The transition to an electric vehicle fleet will be gradual for most organizations. While you rsquo re working with a mix of fuel-powered and electric-powered vehicles, it rsquo s key to treat the two the same as far as record-keeping and management. An electric vehicle fleet management software can help your business track at a transactional level the fueling and charging activity of both types of vehicles. By digitizing your operations, you can get greater visibility into the billing, maintenance, and driver records for the fleet, regardless of power source. Telematics let you monitor key data points for electric vehicles such as state of charge or charging history. What to consider when buying electric vehicles for commercial purposes There are several considerations for buying electric vehicles, including Range Top speed Battery recharging time System for recharge Manufacturer rsquo s intention for the vehicle e.g., urban delivery, local distribution, last mile, long haul, or heavy duty Price When deciding if an electric vehicle is right for your fleet, you rsquo ll also want to ask specific questions about where the manufacturer is in the development process. Why choose Motive for electric vehicle fleet management? The key concern for electric vehicle drivers is range anxiety. With electric vehicle fleet management, you can keep a close eye on the charge state. Remote visibility into your current and historical charging can help inform workflow and ensure efficient fleet dispatch. Telematics can help fleet managers see where assets are in relation to charging stations and their charge state. This can help with route planning and ensure that vehicles are available on the road at peak hours. nbsp Motive rsquo s fleet management software also offers features to increase safety , improve productivity, prevent violations , and lower costs.

            "Jennifer Kolb, VP of Business Development at Tallo, has spent a decade in the workforce industry. Recruiters can do more to attract young talent, she says. Here rsquo s how. Trucking plays a central role in the U.S. economy. If ever there were doubts about that, the pandemic cleared them up. There rsquo s just one problem. Drivers are aging out. A 2021 infographic from Coyote Logistics shows that 80 of America rsquo s truck drivers are 45 or older. Another 23 are over 55. The transportation industry needs to bring new drivers into the fold. Fast. nbsp Tallo , an end-to-end ecosystem for workforce solutions, is alleviating the driver shortage by connecting the next generation of talent to promising careers. In an exclusive interview with Motive, Jennifer Kolb , Tallo rsquo s VP of Business Development, says recruiters must connect with Gen Z students earlier, more strategically, and through messaging that attracts a more diverse pool of candidates. nbsp As a professional in the recruiting space, Kolb offers creative ways to answer Gen Z rsquo s most pressing questions and engage with this sought-after talent pool. What Gen Z knows about trucking In the survey How Logistics and Trucking Companies Can Connect to a New Generation of Drivers , Tallo asked 21,000 high school and college-aged students what they thought about trucking and logistics. Of the respondents, 18 expressed interest in a driving career and 42 were undecided. For recruiters, that rsquo s a lot of untapped potential. Recruiters must lock in the interested group and influence the undecideds. ldquo Changing the perception of trucking comes down to better education, better marketing, and more diverse messaging, rdquo Kolb says. ldquo Sixty-three percent of students surveyed are unfamiliar with trucking careers, and 94 have almost no knowledge of them. rdquo Time away from home and safety concerns topped the list of reasons that Gen Z wouldn rsquo t pursue a trucking career. Fifty-eight percent said they rsquo re deterred by long workdays. To attract young talent, Kolb says recruiters must refine their messaging in the ways discussed below. When Gen Z says, lsquo I don rsquo t want to spend time away from home rsquo ldquo When candidates raise concerns about spending time on the road, it rsquo s an opportunity for recruiters to break the stigma behind driving, rdquo Kolb says. ldquo If lack of home time is a sticking point for candidates, don rsquo t hide from it. Put it out there. Tell drivers, lsquo You rsquo ll be gone these days and home these days, but you rsquo ll be home more than you rsquo re gone. rsquo rdquo nbsp When candidates say they want to be home, it rsquo s an invitation for recruiters to talk about the variety of driving jobs out there. Driving isn rsquo t a one-size-fits-all profession. Still, the industry is dogged by the perception that all driving careers are long-haul routes. ldquo Local drivers are home every night and on weekends, rdquo Kolb says. ldquo Drivers on dedicated routes get ample home time. So do last-mile drivers like UPS and FedEx couriers. There are plenty of options for people who want to drive and return home every night. To change the perception of trucking careers, the industry needs to be talking about a diversity of opportunities, even if the greatest need is in long haul. Promoting a diversity of driving roles is Step 1 to attracting young talent and getting more people in the door. rdquo When Gen Z says, lsquo I rsquo m concerned about road safety and traffic congestion rsquo If Gen Z values safety, they also appreciate cloud technology that rsquo s mobile and easy to use. As the transportation industry becomes more reliant on technology, Gen Z will see digital transformation as an asset. nbsp ldquo Recent high school and college grads expect to work with technology, rdquo Kolb says, ldquo If your company uses AI dash cams and collision avoidance tools, for example, you rsquo ll appeal to these candidates that much more. Especially if you have someone on staff to demonstrate how the technology works. rdquo Gen Z has been using technology since kindergarten. They grew up working with tablets and smartphones. ldquo So any tech that protects drivers from accidents or helps them work faster could attract early talent, rdquo Kolb says. ldquo If you have cool technology that enhances safety performance, productivity, and efficiency, Gen Z will be drawn to that. rdquo When Gen Z says, lsquo I want a better work-life balance rsquo In the Tallo survey, 31 of Gen Z respondents said work-life balance is most important in a future employer. Another 23 said job fit is most important. ldquo If logistics and trucking companies can help employees strike a balance and ensure they get the right skills, hiring and retention will become easier, rdquo the Tallo report states. nbsp Companies can honor Gen Z rsquo s safety concerns by offering safety technology and insurance. Create growth and training opportunities to help employees advance their careers. Pay drivers well . Offer bonuses. And provide paid time off to promote a healthy work-life balance. nbsp ldquo Better yet, show candidates what a day-in-the-life looks like through corporate marketing videos, rdquo Kolb says. ldquo Visuals speak louder than words. Create polished videos with really strong messaging. Talk about the different driving routes and schedules available. Maybe night owls can drive at night or owner-operators can create their own schedules. nbsp ldquo The only way candidates are going to know about these options is if recruiters talk about them, rdquo Kolb continues. ldquo Post the videos on your home page and social media channels. Give young candidates a chance to see themselves at your company. rdquo Participate in student career days Why wait for the next generation to come to you, Kolb says. Bring the profession to them. ldquo A big part of the work-life balance conversation is allowing students to experience the vehicle. Enterprise-level companies that have the resources and capacity to bring a semi or flatbed to a high school for career days should absolutely do it. The transportation industry needs to create more opportunities for students to climb into the vehicle, sit in the driver rsquo s seat, and connect with the space. rdquo Use career days to educate students on the full scope of driving responsibilities, from pre-trip checks to drive time. Tallo rsquo s survey shows that about 60 of high school and college-aged students will engage in Q amp A sessions to learn more about transportation careers. And 54 of them will try a day-in-the-life program. So don rsquo t be shy about hosting programs that give them a closer look at the profession. Promote diversity, equity, and inclusion ldquo Whether posting a video to your website, building advertising content, or taking the vehicle right to a high school, make sure the people featured in your marketing are diverse and engaging, rdquo Kolb says. ldquo This is crucial. Fleets are feeding the stereotype by not featuring diversity in their marketing. If you have a diverse group of people talking about driving careers, you rsquo ll attract more diverse applicants. rdquo Feature drivers who are willing to talk about what they love, Kolb adds, because people feel drawn to engaging stories. Like this UPS commercial . ldquo A little girl connects with the driver and wants to be like her, rdquo Kolb explains. ldquo She wears a little brown suit, rides in a miniature truck. It just goes to show that the face of your company has the power to inspire people to think differently about an occupation. rdquo Connect with young talent early and often In working with industries beyond transportation, Kolb has seen that an ldquo early and often rdquo approach can be most effective. According to Tallo rsquo s data, 37 of early talent decide on careers junior year of high school. Another 43 of them decide senior year. Nearly 75 of early talent job seekers say they rsquo re more inclined to work for employers who connect with them prior to the job search. ldquo It rsquo s a big advantage to have a consumable product, such as Gatorade or Pepsi, because candidates are already familiar with the brand, rdquo Kolb says. ldquo Trucking isn rsquo t a consumable product. So when we say lsquo early and often, rsquo Gen Z is only thinking of brands they know, like Apple, Google, Amazon. To start cultivating that pipeline of young talent, you have to get your brand out there. If a 20-year-old is seeing your logo for the first time, you rsquo re already behind the eight ball in recruiting them. rdquo nbsp So whether it rsquo s sponsoring the local baseball team or joining associations, it rsquo s important to have a brand, a culture, and keep getting your message out there. ldquo Be invested in community events, because those are the efforts that connect with people emotionally, rdquo Kolb says. Provide lsquo right now rsquo jobs through strategic partnerships The trucking industry is most concerned about the gap years between 18 and 21. That rsquo s because high school students generally graduate at 18, and drivers can rsquo t drive across state lines until 21 . That rsquo s a three-year gap in the workforce that the industry has struggled to address. Fortunately, Kolb offers a viable solution in the form of ldquo right now rdquo jobs. ldquo It rsquo s important that the trucking industry ponders strategic partnerships to fill that three-year gap, rdquo she says. ldquo Take one of the largest e-commerce stores, where at the entry level, if a worker has not advanced in three years, they rsquo re let go. If there were an industry for commercial fleets to partner with, these workers could be feeding the pipeline. Someone could work in packing and receiving for three years. After that, they know they rsquo re going to be driving a truck. There rsquo s a lot the industry can do, so don rsquo t think of these as lsquo gap years rsquo or lsquo wasted years. rsquo nbsp ldquo Instead, put young workers in jobs that will make them better drivers, rdquo Kolb continues. ldquo Turn gap years into critical skill-building years, where young people are making good money, building relationships, and being prepped for the next stage of their career. Then at 21, they can go on to drive an 18-wheeler. rdquo If companies wait until students are 21 to connect, it rsquo ll be too late to influence their paths. Still, companies need talent now, and high school students won rsquo t be ready to work for years. If that sounds problematic, make a plan. ldquo The best time to start developing a long-term talent pipeline was 10 years ago, rdquo Kolb says. ldquo The second best time is today. rdquo Workforce development doesn rsquo t have to be so hard.

            "Fleet insurance provides many benefits for companies that own a fleet of commercial vehicles. It protects businesses from repair costs and medical bills, reduces office admin work, and lowers insurance premiums. In this guide to fleet and truck insurance, you rsquo ll learn what fleet insurance is, its costs, the types of commercial truck insurance, and how to find the best insurance for your fleet. What is commercial fleet insurance? Commercial fleet insurance is a financial protection contract that insures company vehicles. It s a critical part of fleet management , because it helps companies avoid losses from accidents, theft, or vehicle damage. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA requires commercial fleets to get fleet insurance when applying for operating authority. What information do you need to take out fleet and commercial truck insurance? Insurance providers typically require various information to underwrite a fleet insurance policy. Here rsquo s a list of frequently requested documentation you rsquo ll need when applying Current commercial insurance policy declarations page. If you don rsquo t have a declarations page, use your current personal automobile insurance contract or request a copy of the declarations page directly from your prior insurer. Your commercial driver rsquo s license numbers and their relevant driving histories, plus any violations, infractions, or citations. nbsp Vehicle identification numbers VINs of every commercial vehicle to be insured, including a summary of each vehicle rsquo s safety features. If you don rsquo t have the VINs at the time of application, give as much relevant vehicle detail as you can, such as the model classification, weight, manufacturer, and the manufacturing year. Specified years of documented loss runs from previous insurance providers for all requested coverage. Audited or reviewed financial statements from a given period, including income through brokerage or trip lease operations. Copies of International Fuel Tax Administration IFTA reports schedule to be specified indicating vehicle mileage by state and total mileage for a given period. Safety ratings from federal compliance reviews, and copies of fleet safety and maintenance programs. Copies of permanent lease and trip lease agreements. What types of commercial truck insurance can you get? Individuals and companies who own fleets of commercial trucks can apply for any of these motor fleet insurance types General liability insurance Also called public liability insurance, general liability insurance in trucking covers property damage and third-party bodily injuries resulting from business activities unrelated to driving commercial vehicles. The FMCSA mandates freight forwarders, owner-operators with authority, and motor carriers to carry general liability insurance. Motor carriers also typically insure their commercial drivers with this policy type. Primary liability insurance Also known as trucking liability insurance, primary liability insurance is the minimum level of insurance required for operating trucking and transport enterprises. Primary liability insurance doesn t cover damages to commercial vehicles or cargo. This policy type requires motor carriers and owner-operators with authority to list or schedule each vehicle on the policy. Otherwise, the insurance provider won rsquo t release claims. Non-trucking liability insurance Non-trucking liability is insurance for using vehicles for non-business purposes. Non-trucking liability insurance covers personal use of your vehicle between your return and the next dispatch schedule. Owner-operators under lease agreements with motor carriers can benefit from this truck fleet insurance type. Although owner-operators have general liability insurance coverage, that policy only covers business operations. Non-trucking liability insurance protects owner-operators from losses during non-business-related incidents. Bobtail owner-operator insurance This owner-operator insurance protects policyholders after they deliver cargo and when using their vehicle for purposes other than trucking. Owner-operators under lease agreements can get bobtail insurance when operating for mobility and not while transporting property for the motor carrier under whose operating authority they deliver, and whose liability policy they depend on while trucking. Bobtail insurance sounds like non-trucking liability insurance. However, there rsquo s one crucial difference. Bobtail insurance covers owner-operators when using the trucks without trailers whether for personal or commercial purposes. Non-trucking liability protects the owner-operator when using the truck for personal intentions, whether or not they carry the trailer. Bobtail insurance doesn rsquo t cover damages to the owner-operator rsquo s truck, but only the liabilities arising from an accident. These liabilities include Expenses for a lawsuit if one occurs. Hospital bills and treatments for any injuries inflicted on a person. Payment for all property damages. Motor truck cargo insurance Motor truck cargo insurance offers protection on the freight or commodity hauled by a for-hire owner-operator. This policy type covers liability for lost or damaged cargo resulting from vehicle crashes, fire, or the striking of a load. Physical damage insurance Physical damage protection is a general term for insurance policies covering your commercial vehicles. Physical damage coverage includes collision insurance and a full, comprehensive policy. Owner-operators can also opt for fire and theft protection with combined additional coverage CAC , a limited insurance for specific heavy-duty commercial vehicle types. Contingent cargo insurance Contingent cargo insurance is coverage for freight brokers involved in complicated claims between a shipper and a motor carrier. This commercial truck insurance covers typical causes of losses, such as cargo theft and damage during transit, for any carrier. Freight brokers should always carry this type of haulage fleet insurance to be prepared for the following incidents One or more parties fail to fulfill their duties. The insurance provider declines a cargo insurance claim. The responsible carrier unwillingly or can rsquo t pay for losses incurred to the shipper rsquo s cargo. Workers rsquo compensation insurance Workers rsquo compensation insurance covers costs associated with an employee rsquo s work-related injury or illness. This insurance even covers legal fees should the employee choose to sue the company. State laws mandate most companies to obtain this type of motor fleet insurance in case their staff gets hurt on the job. Refer to your state laws for trucking-related injuries covered by workers rsquo compensation insurance. Regulations usually cover Work-related illnesses from exposure to hazardous chemicals. Traumatic injuries after a vehicle accident. Stress injuries from repetitive cargo loading and unloading. How much does truck and fleet insurance cost per month? There isn rsquo t a single answer to ldquo how much is truck insurance a month? rdquo because the cost depends on several factors, including insurance type and carrier. Cheap truck insurance doesn rsquo t always mean best, and fleet managers looking for cheap truck insurance should find the pricing option that works best for them. The estimated monthly insurance cost for owner-operators with their own authority can run from 667 to 1,250 . If you rsquo re an owner-operator leasing to a motor carrier, the average monthly truck or semi-truck insurance cost can range from 167 to 333. The monthly semi-truck insurance cost also varies according to factors such as insurance type and carrier. Here are some average price ranges by insurance type Primary liability coverage 416 to 1,000. General liability 42 to 66. Umbrella policy 50 to 58. Bobtail insurance 29 to 50. Cargo insurance 33 to 100. Physical damage 83 to 250. Occupational or workers rsquo compensation insurance 133 to 183. Check with your insurance provider for the monthly insurance cost applicable specifically to your fleet. nbsp What factors affect the cost of commercial truck insurance? In addition to carrier and insurance type, the cost of getting truck insurance depends largely on your commercial fleet rsquo s size, purpose, classification, and more. nbsp For instance, service fleets usually pay cheaper insurance premiums than delivery fleets, since the latter also needs to protect its cargo. Here are some other factors that can impact how much truck insurance costs 1. USDOT operating and driving history If you rsquo re an owner-operator with several violations of U.S. transport laws, your premiums will likely be more expensive. Even offenses as minor as a speeding ticket can raise insurance costs. If your USDOT operating history shows that you demonstrate unsafe driving behaviors, your portfolio will appear risky. Your policy might even be costlier if your driving history shows your involvement in several accidents. That rsquo s because large heavy vehicles with massive truckloads can harm people and properties more than lighter vehicles. 2. Policy requirements There are a few policy requirements to be aware of when looking at the factors that affect commercial truck insurance costs. FMCSA requirements The FMCSA mandates different financial responsibility limits for commercial vehicles and motor carriers For-hire interstate general freight carriers 750,000. For-hire and private carriers of oil and specific hazardous waste types 1 million. For-hire and private carriers of other hazardous substances 5 million. These numbers are the minimum mandatory liability amounts and are typically higher than most state limits, which means drivers and carriers can expect to pay higher premiums. Insurance policy requirements Some insurance contracts require carrying additional coverage according to your protection needs and policy type. This extra coverage can include trailer interchanges such as physical damage from theft, vandalism, fire, and explosion. Motor truck cargo protection is also an additional inclusion. Getting contract additions to protect your assets increases your fleet insurance rates. 3. Cargo type Some products pose a greater risk to transport than other cargo. For example, if you carry heavy farm equipment and get in an accident, you can cause more severe injuries than a truck delivering fruits and vegetables. This type of risk can also mean higher insurance rates but be sure to disclose the type of cargo you plan to transport when getting a quote from your insurance firm. Being precise and transparent with this information can lessen the risk of a denied claim later. 4. Industry risk Similar to cargo type, if your business type generally has greater operational risk, your insurance premiums will likely get more expensive. For instance, a food truck that rsquo s always on the road has a higher chance of getting into an accident. Construction vehicles frequenting unsafe job sites are also high risk. 5. Location Some states have cheaper insurance rates than others because of their varying required minimum liability amounts. For example, you rsquo ll find expensive premiums when operating in Louisiana, Florida, Delaware, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. 6. Operating radius If your commercial vehicles operate in several areas or have a large operating radius , you expose your business to more risks because you have longer driving periods between stops and more route options, including potentially less familiar roads. If you rsquo re a semi-truck driver traveling regionally, your semi-truck insurance cost can go higher than drivers with local routes. 7. Vehicle classification Heavy semi-trucks will have a higher semi-truck insurance cost than lighter pickup trucks transporting the same commodities. This is because the semi-truck has greater potential to cause severe damage in accidents than the pickup truck. Additionally, newer vehicles have higher insurance rates since they rsquo re costlier to replace or repair than older vehicles. Top tips for reducing truck and fleet insurance Follow these tips to lower your fleet insurance costs nbsp 1. Align your insurance limits with the level of risk involved Underinsurance puts your company rsquo s profitability at risk because you end up paying hefty amounts of money if you experience accidents. On the other hand, you could be wasting money if you pay for excessive coverage. Find the appropriate limits for your commercial truck insurance, compare policies from different providers, and get one that best matches your protection needs. 2. Attain excellent SAFER scores Safety and Fitness Electronic Records SAFER refers to FMCSA rsquo s system with records of motor carriers rsquo safety-related profiles and data. You can get SAFER scores that reflect your compliance with road safety and transport regulations. These ratings and other system data are publicly available online. Insurance firms can refer to this information to assess your risk portfolio and policy premiums. If you have low SAFER scores and several noted violations, you might be paying for more expensive insurance contracts. Aim to get excellent SAFER ratings by adhering to the requirements of transport laws. Some examples of mandated activities include keeping updated Hours of Service HOS records and maintaining your vehicles. 3. Pay your insurance premiums in lump sum Avoid paying in installments as much as possible. Opt to pay in full with the annual rate significantly lower your premiums. 4. Increase your deductible Raise your ldquo voluntary excess rdquo or deductibles. This refers to the amount you pay for losses out of your company rsquo s money when making a claim. The deductible can be a specific figure or a percentage of your truck insurance policy. For instance, if you have a coverage of 10,000 and your deductible is 1,500, the insurance firm covers you for 8,500 or up to your coverage limit . Deductibles are a means of sharing the risk between you and the insurance provider. The larger your voluntary excess is, the cheaper your policy can be. Indicate only the deductible amount that you can afford to disburse in the event of an incident. Avoid inputting exaggerated figures simply to lower your premiums. 8. Insure all or several vehicles with one insurance firm Many insurance providers offer discounts or incentives when you insure your entire fleet with them. Ask your insurance firm the size or number of commercial vehicles you can apply for coverage to get lower premiums. 9. Improve your drivers rsquo operating behaviors Insurance providers factor in current and historical driving behaviors to determine your commercial vehicles rsquo risk levels and premium rates. Regularly demonstrating unsafe driving habits can increase the potential of getting into accidents and causing injuries and fatalities. That translates to more expensive insurance policies. Train and re-mentor your drivers to enhance their behaviors when operating on the road. Below is a list of safe driving practices Switch off idle engines. Anticipate road conditions. Reduce driving speed. nbsp Use air conditioning minimally. Avoid activities that can lead to drowsy driving. Maintain tire pressure. nbsp Eliminate unnecessary vehicle weight. 10. Execute an effective fleet safety program Developing a world-class safety program requires a two-pronged approach. nbsp Start by recognizing that drivers are a fleet rsquo s most important asset. Build a strong safety culture to improve safety outcomes. Next, adopt an integrated fleet management solution . Of course, these outcomes must be measured and tracked over time. nbsp All fleets can do this using traditional measures such as roadside violations and crash rates, which can provide valuable insight into the success of the safety program. Unfortunately, these are trailing metrics that measure outcomes that have already happened and impacted a fleet s public safety metrics. nbsp More sophisticated fleets can use data from onboard monitoring systems to get real-time feedback on driver behavior and actions, allowing them to address poor behaviors before they result in a violation or, even worse, a tragic accident. nbsp These fleets should work with their vendors to unlock these technologies true potential and analytic power. 11. Install safety-related, risk management technologies Set up robust technologies to minimize safety risks, optimize your fleet protection program, and improve your chances of getting low-cost truck insurance. These technologies include GPS trackers, dashboard cameras, electronic logging devices ELDs , and vehicle maintenance solutions. GPS tracking tools give real-time vehicle location updates and telematics data, such as direction, speed, and fault codes. If your vehicles are stolen, you can track their whereabouts and enhance your chances of catching the culprit and retrieving your assets. Dash cams integrated with GPS trackers can give you additional visibility into your drivers rsquo risky behaviors. Use the footage to exonerate your drivers from unfair blame, enhance your coaching sessions, keep vehicles in optimal conditions, and improve your fleet rsquo s safety profile. Dash cams can also increase ROI , especially those with artificial intelligence AI . AI dash cams can help prevent accidents by reducing distracted driving and other high-risk road behaviors. They use AI to detect unsafe driving behaviors and notify drivers in real time. With these alerts, you and your drivers can act promptly to avert potential, profit-draining collisions or minimize the incident rsquo s impact and possible losses. ELDs also help lower insurance premiums . These devices record your drivers rsquo HOS and help them avoid overtimes leading to exhaustion, drowsy driving, and accidents. Pair your ELD solutions with GPS trackers to demonstrate your fleet rsquo s HOS compliance during the insurance firm rsquo s evaluation of your primary ratings. Lastly, use vehicle maintenance solutions alongside your developed maintenance plans to get cheaper premiums. These devices and plans show that you carefully look into your vehicles rsquo conditions and ensure their safe, optimal operation. In particular, vehicle maintenance solutions can remind you of any scheduled upcoming upkeep and inspection activities. Maintenance solutions can also detect and notify you of fault codes, enabling you to respond immediately and maintain vehicle safety. Is cheap insurance worth the risk? Getting low-cost truck insurance isn rsquo t wrong. Rather, it rsquo s reasonable. However, if you only consider low prices when looking for commercial truck insurance, you can miss out on securing your fleet rsquo s full protection needs. You can also encounter unrealistically low quotes that are often cheap for the following reasons The policy fails to give critical coverage. Insurance firms usually sell fleet insurance in packages with multiple coverages, such as physical damage, liability, bobtail, cargo, and non-trucking liability. General liability or umbrella coverages are sometimes essential but insurance providers can exclude them from your quote. The policy has lower coverage limits. Insurance policies don rsquo t provide equal dollar amounts to cover the same fleet needs. For instance, some policies offer up to 15,000 for cleanups after a cargo spill. Others can insure you for that same incident for 7,000 only. Ensure your policy has limits that satisfy your preferences and business requirements. Industry misclassification. Unethical agents can miscategorize your company to manipulate your premium rates and make them look like a bargain. Make sure to double-check that this isn rsquo t one of the reasons your quote is inexpensive. How to find the best insurance for your truck or fleet Consider these tips when selecting the most suitable truck insurance for your commercial fleet 1. Inquire about the kind and amount of coverage your fleet will get Ask your insurance firm what its specific coverage will be for your fleet since providers vary in their policy offers. Make sure the insurance firm knows your company inside and out to get proper advice on your coverage. Be open about your company rsquo s overall nature, the location of your operations, and your future plans for your fleet. Then, compare the insurance costs and specific coverage details offered by the insurance firms you rsquo re considering. 2. Know your general liability limits Know your policy rsquo s occurrence and aggregate limits. The occurrence limit is the amount you rsquo ll pay to make one claim, while the aggregate limit is the full price your policy pays for all claims filed in one year. This information lets you identify whether to file a claim for an incident, pay for the damages voluntarily, or find feasible alternatives without compromising your coverage. 3. Learn how the claims processes will go Knowing how to file a claim after an incident enables you to get back to your business operations as soon as possible. Ask these questions Can you make a claim online, through a mobile app, or in-person only? nbsp How long will the claims process take? What are the requirements for filing? Additionally, find out how to check truck insurance status conveniently after making a series of claims to stay updated with your remaining coverage.

            "Even before COVID-19, delivery services were in high demand. With e-commerce booming, more than 21 billion packages were on the move in 2019. Then the pandemic hit, and online shopping became even more common. Industries relied on delivery to stay afloat when people were forced to stay home, and delivery management remains a critical component of business success. This article shares the basics and best practices of the delivery management process and discusses the advantages of delivery management software. What is delivery management? Customers, be they consumers or other businesses, have high delivery standards. In this digital age, expectations for delivery management have grown more daunting. Deliveries are expected to be on time, accurate, and transparent. Customers want to know where their products are at any given moment and plan on when and where they rsquo ll receive their delivery. nbsp Delivery management involves overseeing the logistics of getting cargo from its origin point to its final destination. It also includes supervising drivers , communicating with customers and clients, and monitoring performance metrics to ensure business success. Improve routing, ETAs and on-time deliveries with Motive. Who is in charge of delivery management responsibilities? Most commercial fleets have a delivery manager or logistics manager in charge of reviewing all orders, scheduling deliveries, and evaluating and troubleshooting any issues. The delivery managers Oversee drivers. Provide guidance. Set delivery priorities. Keep customers informed. Address client complaints. Track performance and revenues. These responsibilities make for a time-consuming job for a detail-oriented individual. But delivery management can be made easier with a delivery management app. Why consider a delivery management app? Today rsquo s delivery processes can be streamlined in a single delivery management app. Instead of an individual having to work out the best route for every individual delivery, digital technology can take advantage of the power of artificial intelligence AI and machine learning ML to optimize route planning. This lets you save time on routes to ensure rapid deliveries while continuing to prioritize driver safety and security of cargo. Delivery management software can also automate dispatch. Again, data intelligence can assign tasks to drivers based on several key factors in far less time than it would take a human to make the same calculations. Plus, the app rsquo s software can help keep track of drivers rsquo hours of service and availability for delivery loads. A delivery management app can also support accountability with proof of delivery and transparency through improved team and customer communication. Drivers can easily upload images of bills of lading and add notes about the route or other information about the landing and unloading process to improve future routing. Instead of manually entering information, many delivery management apps offer built-in features for e-signature collection and can automatically generate notifications to customers or managers when load status changes. Avoid having drivers show up to deliver a product when no one is available to receive it, or to collect a load when the loading dock is already crammed with the insights available in a database of deliveries, agents, and customers. An app equipped with GPS tracking makes it possible for delivery managers to track vehicles, making it simple and convenient to communicate with clients about any changes to delivery times or challenges on the route. Learn about features to look for in delivery planning software in our article on delivery route planning tips . Delivery management best practices In the demanding job of delivery management, it can help to adhere to best practices . Many of the suggestions below are supported by delivery management software. Minimize human error Failed delivery attempts and overly long routes are costly. They also frustrate the drivers you rsquo re trying to retain for your fleet. If locations are entered incorrectly, the driver may not be able to find the accurate customer address. Without the right paperwork, that delivery may be held up at an inspection station or not released to the driver from the shipper. Tracking back often to human error, delivery managers can avoid these types of situations with delivery management software. Using an app, drivers can send or receive instant proof of delivery, and fleet managers can quickly validate work with document uploading. Automate dispatch Keeping up with the demands of a delivery business is simple when you can automate dispatch. By using AI and ML technologies to optimize dispatch responsibilities, your fleet can assign delivery orders to the best drivers for that route. The automation software can identify nearby drivers and determine who rsquo s available to fulfill the delivery order in a timely manner. With delivery dispatch automation, you also free up the logistics manager to focus on any issues that arise, ensure customers are satisfied, and train and mentor drivers. Hire and retain qualified drivers Delivery management depends on drivers to take the cargo and make timely deliveries. With a global shortage of experienced drivers, fleet success depends on hiring and retaining qualified drivers. Providing coaching and mentoring can attract drivers to your fleet and keep them learning and growing. Asking your drivers for input also demonstrates respect for their route knowledge. Plus, you can gain valuable insights that support further route optimizations. For instance, they might provide feedback on traffic bottlenecks at problem locations or peak times. They may let managers know about customers who consistently throw off schedules, which impacts on-time delivery metrics . Optimize routes Good route planning can help accelerate delivery, which leads to customer satisfaction and repeat business. In addition to taking into consideration the drivers rsquo availability due to Hours of Service HOS regulations, delivery managers must also Keep drivers and vehicles available for delivery routes. Anticipate the impact of poor weather. Avoid traffic and keep track of road conditions. Understand shipper and recipient expectations regarding loading unloading. Prioritize sustainability and environmental factors. Improve customer service nbsp With the ability to assess and manage all angles of deliveries, fleet managers are better able to meet customer expectations. Plus, they can communicate with greater expedience and accuracy about delivery times or any potential challenges. Tools for improving the delivery management process Improve your delivery management process with software that provides the following key features. Delivery route optimization Routing deliveries by hand is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Plus, there are more likely to be errors. Powerful AI and ML algorithms take into consideration delivery windows, vehicle capacity, driver schedules, weather, and traffic much more efficiently than a human might. nbsp Delivery vehicle tracking Vehicle tracking offers several advantages in delivery management. Fleet logistics managers are able to easily see whether drivers are on their way to their next delivery, stuck in traffic, or heading the wrong way. The real-time visibility helps managers make adjustments to avoid wasting fuel or costly delays such as missing delivery windows. nbsp The real-time awareness of truck locations can also enhance customer communications. Your business can maintain good relationships with clients by keeping their customers happy with notifications informing them about delivery status. Delivery driver dispatch software Empowering fleets with driver dispatch software makes communication between drivers and dispatchers more efficient. Tasks can be assigned through the app. Drivers can contact the office if they need guidance. And everyone benefits from the added context in the software of HOS compliance, fuel and vehicle diagnostics , and GPS awareness of the drivers rsquo location. Driver dispatch software helps managers to prioritize deliveries, balance constraints such as time windows or driver availability, and increases overall accuracy, precision, and reliability. nbsp How to use Motive for your delivery management needs Motive rsquo s delivery fleet management software provides all-in-one delivery route optimization, delivery vehicle tracking, and driver dispatch solutions.

            "Communications consultant Shelley Row discusses nbsp her simple approach to wise decision making. Think. Feel. Act. An aging workforce, supply chain disruptions , rising costs. It rsquo s all in a day rsquo s work for today rsquo s transportation professionals. As trade publications teem with advice on attracting and retaining talent, most of the ideas, such as signing bonuses, truck leasing deals, and promises of ldquo being home for dinner, rdquo are either short-term solutions or none at all. nbsp One topic that doesn rsquo t get much attention is the role leadership plays in attracting and retaining talent. Communications consultant Shelley Row , founder and CEO of Blue Fjord Leaders, knows strong leadership. She rsquo s made a career of training managers how to delegate, empathize, and make difficult decisions. As Row says, ldquo insightful leadership requires seeing beyond the data. rdquo lsquo Insightful leadership rsquo defined Having advised professionals in fleet management and logistics, Row has seen managers rely heavily on data to inform their opinions. While data is vital to running a safe, profitable business, relying on data exclusively comes at the expense of intuition. ldquo Great leaders bring thinking and feeling together into informed decision making, rdquo Row observes. ldquo That rsquo s what insightful leadership is about. rdquo There rsquo s an art to insightful leadership, and Row relies on her training at the NeuroLeadership Institute to explain how it rsquo s done. She rsquo s honed her program into a simple process Think, Seek Input, Feel, and Act. 1. Think To make informed, timely decisions, safety managers should access all the data available. Problem is, the brain rsquo s implicit biases affect a manager rsquo s perception of data. ldquo It rsquo s really important for safety managers to ask themselves, lsquo lsquo Am I only seeing the data I want to see? Could other data show another perspective? rsquo rdquo Row says. Personal biases cause people to gravitate toward innate conclusions. Perhaps a driving coach has a tense relationship with a particular driver. Maybe it rsquo s an employee who needs frequent coaching or has a short attention span. In a situation like that, the driving coach could see a video clip of the driver reaching for a cell phone at the wheel and feel frustrated. nbsp https www.youtube.com embed zDvGPdTLcZc However, there may be another driver whom the coach knows better, one who has a good sense of humor. If that driver reaches for the cell phone in the video clip, the coach might adopt a more positive tone. nbsp It rsquo s called ldquo the halo effect. rdquo According to the website Simply Psychology , ldquo the halo effect refers to the tendency to allow one specific trait to positively influence our judgment of their other related traits. rdquo For example, if a safety manager considers a driver to be friendly, the manager will automatically assume the driver practices safe habits, even though the driver may not have safe habits at all. The halo effect also impacts the way a safety manager interprets dash cam data. That rsquo s why it rsquo s important for safety managers to ensure they rsquo re not falling victim to natural biases while watching dash cam video clips or coaching a driver. Before having conversations with drivers, coaches should ask themselves ldquo gut check rdquo questions, such as ldquo Am I only seeing the data I want to see? rdquo 2. Seek outside input Seeking outside input is actually another form of thinking. ldquo It rsquo s thinking with the insight of other people, rdquo Row explains. Consulting others is especially useful when a safety manager must make a tough decision, such as investing in a safety solution or letting a driver go. If a fleet has a three-strikes policy and a particular driver is about to make their third strike, the safety manager might inform their viewpoint by discussing it with another trusted manager. nbsp ldquo The key is to consult someone who isn rsquo t just going to tell you what you want to hear, rdquo Row says. ldquo Bias can creep in here as well, so safety managers should ask themselves, lsquo Am I only talking to the people who I like? lsquo Am I only seeking input from people who agree with me? rsquo rdquo Groupthink is more prevalent today because of the way it spreads on social media. Anyone, including safety managers, can design personal information sources so that they rsquo re only hearing opinions that validate their own. nbsp ldquo It rsquo s important to listen to people with a different perspective, rdquo Row says. ldquo In one of the programs I do at Blue Fjord Leaders, we discuss talking to people you know and trust, then talking to the person who always has a different perspective mdash that person who rsquo s a little annoying because they always see it differently. rdquo Consider asking them How do you view this situation? If you were making this decision, how would you approach it? What factors would you take into account? ldquo Questions like these aren rsquo t the same as asking, lsquo What would you do? rsquo Row observes. ldquo Instead, they help safety managers overcome their own biases. By broadening the network of people consulted, managers can broaden their perspective. It increases their likelihood of making the wisest choice, and it could increase the likelihood of getting buy-in from a broader set of stakeholders. rdquo 3. Feel Making the best decision means using data and understanding intuition. ldquo Gut feelings are actually wisdom coming from the right side of the brain, the area responsible for attention, memory, reasoning, and problem solving, rdquo Row says. ldquo A gut feeling can cause us to hold back on a decision without understanding why. People get confused. They get lsquo analysis paralysis. rsquo When that happens, they tend to seek out more data, but it rsquo s actually a gut feeling making them hesitate. rdquo Nagging feelings happen when a situation doesn rsquo t meet a manager rsquo s expectations. ldquo Dash cams in commercial vehicles, for example, may go against one rsquo s past experience, rdquo Row says. ldquo An operations manager may have the mindset, lsquo We rsquo ve never had dash cams before, so why are we implementing them now? rsquo Just because it goes against past experience doesn rsquo t mean the past experience is right. It means we should ask ourselves, lsquo Is my past experience relevant to the future? rsquo rdquo Row advises managers to work through fear by understanding the real issue. ldquo Ask yourself, lsquo What rsquo s bothering me about this decision? What rsquo s not sitting right? rsquo The brain will answer. rdquo nbsp 4. Act Give the brain some quiet time, and it will merge thinking with feeling. That rsquo s why it rsquo s important to take a ldquo brain break, rdquo Row says. ldquo Sleep on it, mow the lawn, watch TV. Do something that allows the mind to wander. The brain will put the pieces together and help you make a decision that makes sense and feels right. rdquo After taking a break, you may be surprised to discover that the brain merges data and emotion to make a wiser decision. Row recalls the words of a client who rsquo s had to make tough decisions. ldquo The nagging feeling goes away when you make the right decision. rdquo\n",

            "Regardless of gas prices, economic conditions, or the state of your company, it rsquo s always important to get the most out of your fleet vehicles. Being expensive assets, you want to optimize their use and ensure that at the time of resale or retirement , those cars, trucks, or vans are still in the best possible operating condition. nbsp Now, with the pains of the global supply chain, we rsquo re seeing the need to extend the active lifespan of fleet vehicles. We rsquo ve put together a helpful list of things you can do to ensure that you get the most out of your assets. Understanding the global supply chain crisis While most of the global demand is in the U.S., the supply is primarily in Asia mdash namely China mdash which is still in recovery from the pandemic. As a result, tensions have risen among global trade channels, leaving the global supply chain creaking with shortages of everything from raw materials to livestock feed to vehicles. nbsp To make matters worse, training and testing for truck drivers stalled for almost two years because of COVID-19 lockdowns. This leads to a lack of qualified drivers, in addition to the vehicle shortages facing fleet managers. nbsp Since fleets are still limited in their ability to purchase new vehicles, it rsquo s absolutely critical to extend the life of your existing assets so you can continue to run your business. Be an expert on each vehicle Having the right information is key to being a successful fleet manager. You have to find out what maintenance each vehicle in your fleet needs in order to provide it. Rather than applying universal service schedules across your entire fleet, check the owner rsquo s manual for each vehicle make model to establish the right maintenance routines. Using factory-recommended parts, fluids, and processes can make a big difference in the long run. Fleet maintenance software, such as Fleetio rsquo s, can automatically generate OEM-recommended maintenance schedules when you add your vehicle rsquo s VIN. Carefully track preventive maintenance PM Once you know the correct PM schedules, stick to them. Make it as easy as possible to follow the recommended maintenance by setting helpful email reminders that notify you and your team when service activities are due. Once maintenance has been completed, set a process to store your records for later reference. Fleet maintenance software can give you instant access into an asset rsquo s complete maintenance history . With Motive, AI-powered insights help reduce operating costs with fuel and maintenance management. Proactive maintenance reminders automatically track history and schedule reminders to help you stay on top of your vehicle and asset maintenance. Additionally, you can catch vehicle defects early with fault code detection and real-time alerts to prevent costly breakdowns and delayed work schedules. Keep a clean fleet Proper care for your vehicles starts with the little things. A driver is more likely to care for a vehicle if it rsquo s clean. A tidy truck on the inside and out will reinforce a standard of accountability. Cleaning and protecting vehicles regularly will also guard against unhealthy buildup that could cause issues down the road. Incorporate cleanliness checks into your pre-trip inspections to identify issues and hold team members accountable. nbsp Check the tires Tires are great indicators for your vehicle. If the alignment is off or handling is poor, the first place to look is where the rubber meets the road. Irregular wear is a tell-tale sign that a check-up is in order, and putting off tire maintenance can cause more severe issues down the line. Take a daily look at the tires and help your vehicle stave off problems. As we mentioned before, Motive offers a maintenance management solution that allows for custom vehicle inspection reports. Create custom electronic DVIRs for any vehicle or asset type to make sure your fleet is safe and on the road. nbsp Operate responsibly This one may come as no surprise, but the most impactful way to extend the life of a vehicle is to operate it with care. This includes giving the engine time to warm up properly before each trip. If you have vehicles or equipment that are used infrequently, be sure to crank them up and get the working parts in motion every week or so. Tracking driver behavior is a reliable way to curb unhealthy habits. GPS and other data-gathering hardware provide fleet managers with valuable data that they can use to create guidelines on how to operate company vehicles. nbsp With Motive rsquo s GPS tracking system , get live updates with real-time vehicle visibility, pinpoint specific addresses, and share ETAs to reduce check-in calls and improve customer service. nbsp Learn more about how you can pair Motive with Fleetio rsquo s fleet maintenance software to get deeper vehicle insights and extend the life of your fleet.\n",

            "Like every corner of the global market, the food and beverage distribution industry was flipped on its head by the COVID-19 pandemic. With consumers constrained to cooking from home or ordering in during lockdown, grocery stores and restaurants had to reinvent their operations. Full-service restaurants joined their quick service counterparts in providing home delivery or takeout, and grocers scrambled to match customers rsquo delivery time expectations influenced by the Amazon Effect . This heightened demand for timelier and more frequent deliveries from food and beverage distributors. nbsp But as consumers have grown accustomed to faster and more accessible interactions with businesses through curbside pickup and home delivery services, these service-centric practices are here for the long run. nbsp To succeed in this new landscape, food and beverage distributors, third-party logistics , and last-mile transportation providers must Meet the demand for real-time visibility. Move shipments in a timely manner while maintaining cargo integrity. Build collaborative relationships throughout the supply chain. Build, strengthen, and maintain customer trust. Compete in a tough market and endure supply chain disruptions. Fortunately, telematics and tracking technology , such as electronic logging devices ELDs , dash cams, route optimization software, and fleet management platforms, make it easier than ever to meet these conditions. Keep reading to learn how. nbsp Read Best practices of successful fleet managers . Route optimization Congested roads , peak traffic hours, and unexpected traffic events can lead to slower delivery times and decreased customer satisfaction. This is especially true for time-sensitive food and beverage deliveries. To avoid these problems, distributors, third-party logistics, and last-mile transportation providers can maximize time and order completions through route optimization . Route optimization involves finding the most time- and cost-efficient routes to take when driving between stops. nbsp But it rsquo s more complex than simply finding the shortest path between two points. It requires advanced and complex calculations that can be time-consuming and easily bungled when done manually. This is why most businesses prefer route optimization software . When paired with GPS tracking technology, route optimization software is a powerful tool for the food and beverage distribution industry. At its core, route optimization helps your drivers find the shortest routes to reduce time spent on the road. However, the best types of software also consider other variables to maximize efficiency , such as Customer time windows. Route optimization software can amend your driver rsquo s available routes to ensure they meet customer time window availability, which helps fortify customer trust and loyalty to your business. Vehicle capacity. Calculating the number of orders that can be delivered on one route and how many stops are required based on the number of packages to be transported at one time according to weight and vehicle volume capacity. This can help distributors move shipments in a timely manner while maintaining cargo integrity and driver safety . Traffic congestion. A robust route optimization solution that uses GPS to update road conditions in real time and notify drivers of any known traffic congestion, accidents, or road closures. By sending these notifications, drivers can choose from the recommended alternative route to avoid wasting time in stand-still traffic. Distance between stops. An exact view of the distance between designated stops to provide drivers with a better understanding of their schedule and a clearer prediction of driving time between each stop. Send accurate ETAs In addition to the Amazon Effect, recent supply chain troubles have made an incredibly challenging landscape for food and beverage distribution and delivery providers. Supply chain routing problems can lead to product waste and unnecessary costs, and can damage relationships with customers and business partners. Some of these challenges are unpreventable, but businesses can help circumvent the fallout with the right technology. When combined, ELDs, dash cams , and route optimization and fleet management software and apps magnify the accuracy of delivery ETAs by tracking all vehicles in a fleet in real time and calculating when a driver will arrive at their designated stops. Things like vehicle speed, unexpected travel time, and any upcoming obstructions are accounted for to provide precise delivery status updates. This information can then be shared with customers to give them a complete view of their delivery rsquo s journey from when the driver leaves the dispatch center, and notify them at each step of the route. nbsp Everything is documented ELDs and other fleet management technology solutions collect and store a lot of data. Virtually everything from drivers rsquo hours of service to their driving behaviors, like hard braking or sudden acceleration, to vehicle maintenance alerts is documented and can be referenced at any time. nbsp Electronic documentation of this data is incredibly valuable for food and beverage distributors because it can aid in collaboration across the supply chain and across departments, provide full visibility into operations and improve ETA accuracy, and provide reference information for future deliveries of the same nature or to the same customer. nbsp Electronic documentation is also crucial for fleet management reporting. With a fleet data management system , you can connect multiple data points from your fleet that give you more information about the health and performance of your fleet. Managers can monitor the status and productivity of their vehicles and determine which vehicles are over- or under-utilized, receive vehicle fault code alerts that are then recorded for later analysis, and pull reports for insurance audits or tax reporting. Nybll , a health-centered food service that helps professionals and pro-athletes achieve peak performance, avoided a significant personal injury lawsuit thanks to documented dash cam footage and engine feedback. With this data, Nybll was able to show that its driver made a safe lane change at a safe speed when a motorcyclist, driving 50 to 60 miles an hour, hit the driver from behind and crashed. The food delivery service also relies on GPS documentation to maintain strong client relationships. Nybll managers can track vehicles rsquo routes and traffic conditions and notify its clients of delivery status updates, and provide context for any late deliveries.

            "Innovation starts at the top. When General Motors Chair and CEO Mary Barra spoke at the Consumer Electronics Show CES in Las Vegas, she put forth a compelling vision. One where the future is electric and crashes, emissions, and congestion are things of the past. nbsp With its focus on automotive advancements, Barra rsquo s keynote seems a great starting point for Motive rsquo s Spotlight on Innovation series. The series commemorates big ideas and bold capabilities emerging from the most forward-thinking companies in the U.S., such as GM. ldquo As we implement our growth strategy, we have an opportunity, and frankly a responsibility, to create a better future for generations to come, rdquo Barra told the CES audience. ldquo Visionary investments made over the last decade in electrification, software-enabled services, and autonomous driving have enabled GM to transform from automaker to platform innovator. rdquo Striving to become carbon neutral by 2040, GM is turning to world-class technologies to spin aspiration into reality. GM will invest 35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles by 2025, and has plans to launch more than 30 electric vehicles globally by the same year. nbsp By 2035, GM will offer a lineup of all-electric light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. ldquo These all-electric HD trucks will be engineered to deliver effortless heavy-duty hauling and towing while offering customers amazing new features and a range needed to get the toughest jobs done, rdquo Barra said. nbsp Powering tough jobs to completion is Ultium, GM rsquo s electric vehicle battery platform. Ultium is the backbone of GM rsquo s alt-fuel revolution, and it rsquo s powering the production of EVs across several vehicle types, including commercial vehicles. In 2021, GM created BrightDrop , a service that decarbonizes e-commerce and last-mile delivery through smarter, safer delivery. nbsp ldquo In the case of BrightDrop, Ultium has enabled us to create entirely new categories, rdquo Barra said. ldquo Just one year ago, we introduced BrightDrop as an ecosystem of light commercial electric vehicles, electrified containers, and cloud-based software that reimagines the delivery industry for an all-electric future, building smarter and more efficient solutions for last-mile logistics. rdquo In his comments at CES, BrightDrop president and CEO Travis Katz explained how ldquo BrightDrop leverages the best of two worlds mdash the cutting-edge innovation, agility, and focus of a technology startup with the engineering and manufacturing might of General Motors. rdquo nbsp Backed by GM, BrightDrop delivered its first five all-electric delivery vans to FedEx in late 2021, just 20 months after the vehicle was conceived. That makes the EV 600 the fastest vehicle to market in GM rsquo s history. In June, FedEx received 150 additional electric delivery vehicles from BrightDrop , an important milestone for FedEx on its road to zero emissions. Last-mile delivery companies such as FedEx and Walmart have invested in BrightDrop rsquo s electric vehicles at a time when e-commerce is expanding rapidly. Walmart has reserved 5,000 BrightDrop EVs that will begin hitting the road in 2023. ldquo The vans will not only be used to support in-home delivery in 2023 but also our broader last-mile delivery initiatives, rdquo Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon told the CES audience. In partnering with FedEx, Walmart has been able to maintain its promise of free next-day and two-day shipping from Walmart rsquo s e-commerce fulfillment centers, McMillon said. In June, Walmart announced it rsquo s expanding its e-commerce services through four next-generation fulfillment centers featuring a blend of manpower, robotics, and machine learning. nbsp ldquo Once opened, the new centers, along with the company rsquo s existing regional distribution centers and over 4,700 stores, will enable same-day shipping of millions of items to 80 of the U.S. population, rdquo Freightwaves magazine writes. Through Ultium-based electric vans, services like BrightDrop can reduce carbon emissions from last-mile delivery. ldquo With our software and electrified containers, we can help dramatically reduce traffic congestion in our cities and help make our streets safer for pedestrians and drivers, rdquo Katz said. In GM rsquo s vision, electric-vehicle technology will pave the way for a safer, more efficient future. Like GM and its partners, Motive helps commercial fleets become safer and more sustainable.

            "The global supply chain crisis has hit fleets of all services and sizes hard. Across industries, many businesses are struggling to operate let alone turn a profit. nbsp So how are fleet managers adapting to today rsquo s evolving challenges? To find answers, Motive partnered with Wakefield Research to survey 1,000 fleet managers in construction, oil and gas, agriculture, delivery service, passenger transit, food and beverage, field service, and trucking and logistics. Download the full report , or read on for four key findings. 1. Take a proactive approach to safety Roughly 39 of fleet managers said that improving driver safety is one of their biggest challenges, but too much administrative work distracts them from implementing safety measures. A traditional safety strategy that relies on manual administration is both time-consuming and expensive. To reduce administrative tasks and proactively increase safety, 60 of fleet managers said they want to adopt fleet management platforms. The right AI-powered platform can accurately detect unsafe driving behaviors , automatically coach drivers, and streamline safety reporting. This proactive approach to safety can minimize manager overhead while reducing accidents on the road. Prevent accidents and improve driving with the Motive AI Dashcam. 2. Eliminate manual processes Labor-intensive, repetitive tasks waste a shocking amount of time. Surveyed fleet managers estimated that their employees waste an average of five hours per day on repetitive administrative tasks. That adds up to three full days of the five-day work week. nbsp In the report, 33 of managers said their manual processes make it difficult to track information accurately, while 28 said they rsquo re concerned about the potential risk any manual errors could present. To address this massive time loss, nearly 100 of fleet managers surveyed are shifting towards technology that automates repetitive tasks such as vehicle maintenance scheduling, fuel management, driver safety, invoicing, and asset tracking. Fleet managers use automation technologies like Motive to save time, digitize operations, and improve data accuracy. 3. Reduce inefficient spending Nearly all fleet managers 98 are dealing with increased business costs, pushing managers to reassess their spending habits. In the report, 37 of fleet managers shared that inefficient spending is a big challenge for managing their finances, with 32 citing a lack of visibility and clarity into employee expenses as one of their biggest issues. Many fleet managers are consolidating tools and switching to a single fleet management platform for a comprehensive view of their operation rsquo s fiscal health. By centralizing all their information into one tool, fleet managers can identify inefficient spending habits and make informed financial decisions. nbsp Just switching from multiple subscriptions to a single tool can instantly save companies tens of thousands of dollars. But the right fleet management platform can empower managers with key financial features like fuel cards to save at the pump , preventative maintenance alerts to avoid costly repairs, and receipt uploads to reduce time-consuming paperwork. 4. Apply automation As fleet managers turn to technology to help solve their safety, operational, and financial challenges, many hope to adopt cutting-edge solutions that automate processes. Fleet managers want their tech to do more than just digitize data. They want their solutions to help them work smarter and faster. The report shows that 98 of fleet managers want to automate repetitive business tasks so they can focus their efforts on higher priority initiatives. And 44 of survey respondents said automation will be one of the top investment priorities for the next two years. nbsp Download the full State of Fleet Management report to discover more ways companies like yours use technology and automation to adapt to today rsquo s fleet management challenges.\n",

            "Bobtailing in the trucking industry can often be dangerous for both the truck driver and others on the road. This article will explain ldquo what is bobtailing, rdquo outline the risks, and share safety tips to help commercial fleet owner-operators support their drivers. Bobtailing explained Semi-trailer trucks play a valuable role in the economy. They move cargo and support supply chain logistics. In bobtail driving, the semi-truck is on the road without an attached trailer. The driver may be picking up cargo at the beginning of their shift. Or they may have already dropped off cargo and be heading home. Bobtailing shouldn rsquo t be confused with deadheading, which is when the driver is hauling an empty trailer. To help differentiate the two terms, consider the origins of the word. The term ldquo bobtailing rdquo is thought to originate from cutting down a horse rsquo s tail to avoid its hair from getting caught in horse-drawn sleighs, or from the resemblance of the truck without its trailer to a breed of cat with particularly short tails. What is a bobtail truck? A bobtailing truck is a semi-truck without its bulky trailer. That might seem like a good thing for the driver. However, these trucks are designed to carry loads. So, the truck s weight changes when the semi-truck is in bobtail mode. The difference in the weight means the driver should adjust their maneuvering and braking . Types of bobtail trucks There are three common types of bobtail trucks nbsp A semi-truck has a tractor unit and a trailer, with a fifth-wheel type hitch attaching the trailer and tractor. nbsp A small- to medium-sized ldquo small bobtail truck rdquo has all its axles connected to the same chassis. These trucks are more often used for carrying lighter or medium-weighted loads. nbsp A straight propane truck supplies fuel to gas stations or auto dealers, and has a storage capacity of about 5,000 gallons. How long is a bobtail truck? A bobtail truck rsquo s typical dimensions are 24 feet long, 13 feet 4 inches tall, and 96 inches wide, excluding the mirrors. The weight of a bobtail t ruck depends on the number of people on board, the amount of fuel carried, and the size of the sleeper car as well as other specs. However, with two drivers and full fuel and diesel exhaust fluid DEF tanks, expect the weight to be around 20,000 pounds. nbsp What causes bobtail in trucking? Bobtail in trucking happens when the driver is en route to a dispatch site to pick up a loaded trailer. Alternately, when the driver returns to a terminal after dropping off the cargo-carrying trailer. Why is bobtailing dangerous? According to the Department of Transportation, truck collisions have risen since 2008 in the United States. The increase of trucks on the road, and pressure on drivers during the ongoing supply chain crisis, does little to cut back on this concern. Semi-trucks bobtailing between deliveries add to the list of potential dangers on the road. nbsp Bobtailing is dangerous because trucks are designed to carry heavy loads. Because these trucks are expected to carry cargo most of the time, most of the braking power is in the rear axle, under the trailer. So, when a truck is bobtailing, the weight is over its front wheels, which are set up more for steering than braking. The braking power is reduced because there rsquo s little weight over that rear axle. Additionally, drivers are trained to handle trucks with trailers attached. There may be less attention paid to preparing drivers to bobtail, as it happens less often. Yet, this is a more challenging mode to drive the truck. nbsp Top bobtail driving safety tips Preserve the space cushion around your vehicle. Also, make sure that you rsquo re allowing adequate time and distance for the truck to come to a stop during bobtailing. With less weight comes less friction, which can dramatically increase the truck rsquo s braking needs. nbsp Be alert on winding roads or when driving downhill . Bobtail trucks are more likely to skid out in tight or sudden curves. The change in braking can also impact downhill driving. A bobtail truck can pick up speed faster than a loaded truck. Wet weather, snowy, or icy conditions can also be more challenging when trucks are in bobtail mode. These trucks are more difficult to maneuver and brake, and inclement conditions add complexity to safe driving efforts. Make sure to check road and weather conditions before bobtailing. nbsp Also, avoid driving a bobtail truck when tired . This type of driving requires more attention and can be stressful. nbsp Lastly, be aware that your truck clearance may be higher as the vehicle isn rsquo t weighted down by the attached trailer. nbsp Why drivers dislike bobtailing Drivers dislike bobtailing because of the dangers associated with driving a truck that rsquo s more challenging to operate. Additionally, driving a bobtail truck costs the driver money for fuel while they aren rsquo t generating revenue from carrying a load. To make things even more unpleasant, the driver is often in for a much bumpier ride when the semi-truck doesn rsquo t have its trailer attached. How much does bobtail insurance cost? Drivers, or the fleet companies they work for, generally need bobtail insurance, physical damage insurance, and non-truck liability coverage. The bobtail insurance typically costs less than the general trucking liability insurance. Commercial Truck Insurance HQ suggests it rsquo s ldquo usually within the 35- 60 month range. The site also suggests you may get a better deal by packaging the different types of insurance. Keeping a solid driving record and taking a higher deductible can also help lower bobtail insurance costs. How to use Motive to prevent bobtailing truck accidents Bobtailing can rsquo t always be avoided, so commercial fleet owners and operators should do their part to prevent bobtailing truck accidents. That starts with educating team members about the risks and safety measures. Accident prevention powered by artificial intelligence AI can help too. The Motive AI Dashcam and automated coaching technology can transform the safety of your fleet . Motive rsquo s fleet management and safety solution can help drivers avoid bobtailing accidents by detecting other unsafe driving behaviors.

Over the past 20 years of Gallup polling, beer has remained the top preference for Americans. In 2021, beer was the first choice for 39 of consumers, followed by wine at 31 , and spirits at 27 . At the same time, beer inventory has expanded to meet more specific tastes. ldquo The industry shipped approximately 3.5 million barrels of hard cider, perry an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of pears , and other fermented products, equivalent to more than 49 million cases 24-12 ounce containers in 2021, rdquo according to the NBWA , a brewing industry group. nbsp The unceasing demand for these refreshments has also seen a historic number of new industry entrants. According to the NBWA, there were 49 breweries in 1983. Today, some states have more breweries than the entire country had in 1990. At the end of 2021, there was an all-time high of 13,380 permitted breweries in the U.S. Retail stores need beer shipments from discount to big-box to convenience stores. There rsquo s also a wholesale and online market. All in all, there rsquo s a great demand for beer shipping . nbsp How to package beer for shipping When packaging beer for shipping, the primary goal is to keep the contents secure and fresh. The cans or bottles could experience a bumpy ride without proper safety measures, leading to explosions. nbsp Package the beer using lightweight materials proven to stabilize temperatures and protect contents. You might use insulated foam, pre-molded polystyrene, or molded fiber inserts. Whatever you decide to go with, it needs to be strong enough to prevent breakage and help keep the beer at a consistent temperature. As beer is an age-restricted, perishable, and commercially limited substance, your packages should be clearly labeled. The best way for enterprise couriers to ship beer Shipping beer has special considerations. Cases of canned beer may be more durable, but beer bottles are fragile. Then, whatever the packaging, the optimal temperature for shipping beer is between 37 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit. Too cold, and the beer can freeze. When beer freezes, the water expands and can burst the cans or bottles. Too hot, and the beer can spoil. It rsquo s best to ship beer in a climate-controlled manner to avoid inconsistent temperature risks. Of course, there are many different ways that shippers package their beer. So you rsquo ll need to know how to ship a variety of beer containers. Pallets work well when shipping beer. Wood pallets are standard, but plastic pallets are becoming more popular because of their durability. Plastic pallets are also preferable in the food and beverage industry as they don rsquo t absorb spilled liquids. However, wood pallets are prone to mold and mildew growth. A typical pallet is 48 by 40 inches and can hold 20 1 6 bbl kegs or 14 1 4 bbl kegs, or 8 1 2 bbl kegs. Equipped Brewer estimates, ldquo A pallet stacked with full kegs weighs approximately 1,200 ndash 1,400 pounds. rdquo The pallets can only be stacked two high, since the bottom pallet has a weight limit. nbsp How to ship a case of beer When shipping a case of beer, the weight is a factor in how many cases can go on a pallet. A 12-pack of 12-ounce beer cans weighs about 20 pounds. As a result, many shippers limit the number of beer cases per pallet to 100. That rsquo s 2,200 pounds. To avoid overweighting the truck, consider the weight of the pallets as well. Overstocking is also to be avoided. nbsp Shipping beer bottles When shipping beer bottles, first secure the caps on the bottles. Unless the caps are already waxed, you rsquo ll want to be sure you secure them in case they get caught on other materials. A snag can cause the cap to come off or leak. Then, wrap the beers in plastic followed by padding to prevent scratches, dents, or bottle breakage. Adding a layer of protection between the top and bottom of the box and between the bottles can help prevent damage. Another type of bottle you might ship is a growler. A typical growler is about 11 to 12 inches tall and about 5 to 6 inches wide. Place the growler in a plastic shipping bag to protect against scratches. Then, seal the bag and wrap it in padding like bubble wrap to keep the growler from breaking inside the box. Make sure there isn rsquo t too much space left over the bottle will rattle around. If there rsquo s too little space in the box, there might not be enough padding to protect the bottle. nbsp Shipping beer cans When shipping beer in cans, you rsquo ll want to situate them firmly in the shipping box. Surround them with molded fiber, polystyrene box inserts, bubble wrap, or even newspaper. Avoid too much extra space above the tops of the cans when you close the box. Put shipping labels on the top of the box. Shipping labels can help expedite the loading and unloading process by providing clear instructions on how to place the packages in the truck. You can also add directional stickers and labels to mark packages containing alcohol content. How to ship beer legally Unsurprisingly, you can rsquo t just ship beer anywhere to anyone. There are different federal and state regulations to abide by. To begin, legally shipping beer requires A valid business license that demonstrates you have an EIN and are lawfully conducting business in your home state. nbsp A manufacturer or dealer rsquo s license that proves you rsquo re sourcing alcoholic beverages legally. A shipping license to track which businesses are sending alcoholic products across state lines. Beer shipping laws and regulations Protect your shipments from federal or state penalties by understanding beer shipping laws and regulations . Licensed manufacturers or dealers can ship beers to retailers. However, retailers can rsquo t ship to other commercial entities. Commercial entities also can rsquo t ship beer directly to consumers, unless they rsquo re in particular states. All beer shipments require a signature from an adult over 21 years of age accepting the package. What states allow beer shipping? When Prohibition ended in the 1930s, states gained the power to enact their own alcohol laws. This extends to how beer is shipped. When beer crosses state borders, shippers must consider the laws for both the shipping and nbsp the receiving state. nbsp According to the National Conference of State Legislatures ldquo The majority of states have statutory provisions that allow for out-of-state manufacturers to ship alcoholic beverages directly to consumers. rdquo ldquo Out of the 54 states, territories, and commonwealths, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. nbsp Virgin Islands do not have statutes that specify that direct shipments are allowed. rdquo ldquo Delaware requires that shipments must be delivered to a wholesaler, then delivered to consumer by a retail license. rdquo nbsp ldquo Rhode Island requires that the consumer must be present at purchase to ship the alcohol to the consumer. rdquo ldquo Eight states allow the direct shipment of beer as specified Delaware, Massachusetts, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Virginia. Connecticut and New Jersey allow shipments of wine, cider and mead. rdquo nbsp ldquo New Mexico authorizes the shipment of wine and cider. rdquo nbsp ldquo Oregon allows the shipment of beer, wine and cider. Arkansas allows the shipment of wine and mead. rdquo How to be the best beer shipping service nbsp Alcoholic beverages and any kind of liquid products in glass bottles are considered dangerous for shipping. Providing the best beer shipping service means paying special attention to fragile cargo. nbsp Add auditing measures to ensure the packages are shipped securely. Those loading and unloading beer shipments need to make sure they rsquo re paying attention to directional cues. Plus, they need to strap in the cargo and avoid accidents. nbsp Taking care not to ship beer in extreme temperatures can also help your company stand apart from the competition as a premium beer shipper. The best beer shipping service will also optimize delivery routes, communicate with customers about the estimated time of cargo delivery, and track the necessary paperwork for easy auditing and accountability. What we can learn shipping beer FedEx Establish beer shipping criteria to ensure you rsquo re vetting customers against federal and state regulations. Have an approval process in which a fleet team member first verifies business licensing, dealer, or manufacturer licensing, and shipping licensing. nbsp Offer a variety of shipping services. FedEx ships beer through FedEx Ground when shipments aren rsquo t time-sensitive, via FedEx Express when expedience is needed, and FedEx Home when the recipient is a residential address. What we can learn shipping beer UPS Communicate beer packaging requirements upfront. When shipping beer, UPS accepts folded corrugated cardboard, molded fiber tray inserts, or expanded polystyrene foam EPS .

            "Recognizing the risks to our economy from a shortage of commercial truck drivers, the government has launched a plan. The Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot SDAP program will allow younger drivers with a commercial driver rsquo s license to drive interstate. This article explores the conditions of SDAP and the program rsquo s value to enterprise companies. Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot program explained The Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot program is a new approach to driver training. It was established by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association FMCSA . The SDAP encourages enterprise companies to offer trucking apprenticeships to a younger demographic of drivers. The current commercial driver population is aging, as is the workforce in many industries. Brad Ball , the president of Roadmaster Drivers School, says, ldquo There s been a shortage for many years, and the primary reason is that more people are retiring than getting into the industry. rdquo In January 2022, the government announced this effort to help individuals ages 18, 19, and 20 explore interstate trucking careers and help trucking companies hire and train new drivers through an apprenticeship pilot program. What is the aim of the Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot program? Drivers between the ages of 18 and 20 can drive semi-trucks in every American state with the exception of Hawaii . But not across state borders. So, an 18- to 20-year-old can currently drive the roughly 800 miles from Key West to Pensacola within Florida, but they can t drive 80 miles across state lines. ldquo It s a little ridiculous that we don t think they can drive across state lines, rdquo says Ball. As part of the 1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act IIJA , the SDAP aims to attract more drivers to the industry to help ease the global supply chain crisis. The SDAP invites a maximum of 3,000 apprenticeship drivers at a time to participate in the three-year program. The American Trucking Associations ATA estimates the United States is facing a shortage of more than 80,000 truck drivers. Plus, it predicts that the gap may grow to 160,000 by 2030. nbsp Key requirements of participants in the Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot program The program raises standards for drivers under the age of 21. To qualify under the SDAP program , drivers will need A commercial driver rsquo s license in their home state. To complete two probationary periods. One for 120 hours and the other for 280 hours. Specific vehicle safety technologies installed on their trucks. The required safety technologies include speed governance, an active braking collision mitigation system, and a forward-facing dash cam. nbsp Apprentices will be disqualified from the program in the event of a major offense, serious traffic violation, railroad-highway grade crossing violation, or an out-of-service order violation. Why enterprises should consider implementing this truck driving apprenticeship Truck driving apprenticeship programs provide opportunities to under-21 drivers. The ban on interstate commerce has been a recruitment challenge in the past. However, with the SDAP program, fleets can recruit and train young drivers who are at the age of selecting a career path to drive. Appealing to younger drivers not only counters the current, aging workforce, but also provides fleets with access to new employees who are adaptable and independent. nbsp What motor carriers need to be eligible for SDAP The FMCSA isn rsquo t yet accepting applications yet, but motor carriers will need to apply to participate in the pilot program. nbsp To qualify, the carrier must Have proper operating authority, if required, and registration. Have at least the minimum levels of financial responsibility required by the FMCSRs. Not be a high- or moderate-risk motor carrier as defined in 81 FR 11875 . Not have a conditional or unsatisfactory safety rating. Not have open enforcement actions, e.g., Imminent Hazard, Operations Out-of-Service OOS Orders, Patterns of Safety Violations in the previous six years. Not have a crash rate above the national average. Not have a driver OOS rate above the national average. Not have a vehicle OOS rate above the national average. What are the main challenges facing truck driving apprenticeship programs? During the truck driving apprenticeship, drivers are able to transport goods across state lines. But they may only do so with an experienced driver supervising from the passenger seat. The supervising driver must be at least 26 years old, with a minimum of five years of interstate experience. Commercial fleets will need to provide incentives to the supervising drivers to sit in the passenger seat instead for those trips. Motor carriers participating in the SDAP program must also report monthly to the FMCSA until the drivers reach the age of 21. The FMCSA expects to hear within 24 hours if there rsquo s an injury, a fatal crash involving an apprentice, or an alcohol-related citation. nbsp Examples of trucking companies with apprenticeship programs Even before the SDAP, many trucking companies had apprenticeship programs. The difference is that this new pilot program has specific requirements for a probationary period and safety technology to train young drivers in interstate commerce. Learn more about paid CDL training opportunities in our article on what commercial drivers need to know about this option. How Motive can help you meet the SDAP rsquo s technology requirements and train new drivers with confidence The SDAP requires carriers to train new drivers and provide vehicle safety tools. Both are part of the Motive fleet management software solution . The Motive AI Dashcam meets SDAP criteria while supporting safety efforts and making driver coaching programs more effective. The dash cam lets you see things from the driver rsquo s perspective. Recordings of critical driver behaviors such as hard braking, hard cornering, or excessive acceleration can also be used in driver coaching programs. Training new drivers is easier with Motive rsquo s turnkey coaching workflow, which automatically pinpoints driving behaviors that require coaching and provides relevant videos and coaching history to help personalize timely feedback. Drivers can also view dash cam videos at the end of a trip in the Motive Driver App to receive automated coaching. The integrated driver coaching software also lets you proactively manage safety events, tag drivers with different coaching statuses, leave notes, and simplify driver training. The DRIVE risk score tracks the impact of coaching over time, taking into account the context and severity of every safety event. The Motive Driver App provides easy access to driver logs and other documentation , which can help with SDAP reporting to the FMCSA. nbsp Get ready to do your part in the SDAP with Motive technology.

            "The future is here. Robots are delivering medicine in hospitals. Drones are dropping off food orders straight to your door. Logistics companies are also investing in autonomous trucking to help address last-mile delivery challenges . This article explores the state of autonomous trucking today and the potential benefits and drawbacks that this technology can offer to logistics enterprises. What is autonomous trucking? Autonomous driving trucks are commercial vehicles that rely on technology to get from point A to point B. The person in the driver s seat is replaced by artificial intelligence AI automation and machine learning ML , which draw data inputs to travel on highways and other public roads between shipping yards and warehouses to the long-haul destination. How do autonomous trucks work? Autonomous trucking technology uses long-range, high-resolution sensors and the power of AI ML to follow the established delivery route and account for any obstacles on the road. Autonomous driving technology processes the sensor data to perceive objects in real time. The technology can recognize traffic signs, emergency vehicles, and other vehicles on the road. nbsp People supervise autonomous driving systems in current pilot programs, but the technology is meant to learn. As the machine s neural networks process more routes, operation without human supervision can become a future reality. Key elements of autonomous trucking technology According to McKinsey, the autonomous trucking industry is likely to develop in four waves. Already there are platooned autonomous trucks with drivers handling the non-interstate highway driving. nbsp In phase two, a single driver is in the lead truck and a second truck follows along the interstate highway route. A second driver takes the wheel of the autonomous truck on non-interstate highways. nbsp The consultants predict the next stage will see autonomous trucks platooning on the highway, maybe even more than two trucks, with drivers involved at pickup and drop-off. Finally, driverless trucks will eliminate the need for human involvement at any point in the journey. Benefits of autonomous trucks There are several benefits of autonomous trucks. Here are the main advantages to consider. Streamlines delivery Federal regulations limit the number of hours a driver can work without taking a break. Under Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA regulations , drivers may only drive a maximum of 11 hours after 10 consecutive hours off duty. There are no similar limitations for autonomous truckers, which leads to faster delivery. Helps combat driver shortage Trucking moves the majority of all goods shipped in the United States. However, the American Trucking Association ATA predicts a need for 160,000 drivers by 2028. The autonomous trucking industry is one effort to address the shortfall . Autonomous trucks don t need to be recruited nor retained. Plus, they don t have to adhere to federal requirements about the amount of time spent on the road and behind the wheel. Reduces costs McKinsey estimates with full autonomy, operating costs would decline by about 45 percent, saving the US for-hire trucking industry between 85 billion and 125 billion. While the capital expenditures will rise with purchase of the trucks, the company s balance sheet will be dramatically impacted. nbsp In Deloitte s estimation , autonomous trucking has the potential to lower per-mile costs by 30 or more. Autonomous truck companies will also enjoy greater fuel savings from optimized routes. Plus, taking driver behaviors out of the equation can cut down on fuel consumption. Lowers carbon emissions Self-driving trucks make logistics greener . The autonomous tech can reduce fuel consumption by up to 40 and optimize asset performance to cut carbon emissions. It s also anticipated that autonomous trucking will make electric trucks more viable, which can further help fleets meet their sustainability goals. Improves safety Automated driving trucks aim to deliver safety benefits. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states automated vehicles have the potential to save lives and reduce injuries since 94 nbsp of serious crashes are due to human error. After all, a machine won t fall asleep at the wheel , look away from the road in a moment of distraction, or run a red light. nbsp Better driver experience With autonomous trucking, drivers can enjoy better working conditions. The self-driving trucks can handle the long-haul routes that take people away from family and friends. The technology can take the wheel while a driver sleeps. Autonomous technology works best on the routine and mundane tasks. Exactly the type of driving that bores the human driver. Drawbacks of autonomous driving trucks Autonomous trucks offer many advantages. Still, there are some potential pitfalls. For one, the technology isn t as reliable in fog or snowy weather conditions . Additionally, the technology requires robust wireless connections. The adoption of high-speed 5G wireless is in the works, but it will take longer in some areas of the country. In places without 5G, wireless remote driving will be much more difficult. Cybersecurity is another concern. The manufacturers need to develop autonomous trucks with robust security in place to counter the risk of vehicle systems getting hacked. Lastly, drivers are still needed to drive autonomous trucks in cities and urban environments, as the software can t navigate at the moment. Challenges facing the autonomous trucking industry In addition to the concerns about road conditions, cybersecurity, and public acceptance, autonomous trucks also have greater stopping distances. They need to see much further ahead down the road to be able to react in time. The trucks are often cab-less, but the standard 18-wheel truck can still weigh up to 40 tons, which could be hazardous on the road. Self-driving trucks will also require supervision, at least from the outset. That means new jobs monitoring the autonomous truck driving industry. But first, people need to be trained to do so effectively. When will autonomous trucks be on the road? There isn t a conclusive answer to when autonomous trucks will be on the road. Several sources predict it will happen in the next decade. Still, Chris Spear of ATA suggests it will be closer to 20-25 years before autonomous trucks are used widely . nbsp Still, there s no question that the technology is in the works and progress is being made. Automated trucks are completing successful experimental runs in the United States, Europe and China. In one pilot program from Plus , self-driving truck technology company, the supervised autonomous trucks operated over over 62,000 miles without issue. How will self-driving truck technology transform the logistics sector? Self-driving truck technology is likely to make its biggest impact in last-mile delivery . The rapid growth of the e-commerce industry has seen an increased demand for flexible, fast, traceable, and personalized last-mile delivery . nbsp However, meeting customer expectations is costly. Fuel costs are high. Failed deliveries or having to store warehouse shipments can be expensive. Idling, down time, and out-of-route miles also cut into profits. nbsp Autonomous trucking can help tackle these logistics challenges with optimized route planning and the ability to keep trucks on the road for more hours and greater distances without worrying about the driver s fatigue or Hours of Service compliance . The move to autonomous trucking can also impact liability and safety regulations. nbsp How Motive s route optimization software can help autonomous trucking companies When the transition to autonomous trucks happens, logistics enterprises will need to track and map their assets . Optimizing autonomous trucking routes can help companies recoup their investments. Motive helps optimize dispatch and workflow by enabling smarter route decisions. Our route optimization software considers customer time windows, vehicle capacity, traffic congestion, the distance between stops, and other variables to maximize efficiency. nbsp The software uses advanced algorithms to accurately decide which are the most time-efficient routes to follow, eliminating human error and making drivers lives easier. Plus, drivers get a full view of driving time between each stop and any potential obstructions. Motive s software enables fleet managers to access real-time and historical route and driver data as well as vehicle safety insights. With weather and traffic overlays, you can improve productivity and safety too. At Motive , our focus is helping commercial fleets of all types and sizes become better, smarter, and more effective.

            "Contactless delivery became a norm as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Enterprises looking to limit physical contact and keep customers and employees safe moved to offer no-contact delivery. Contactless delivery service works differently, but it can offer many benefits, especially when companies leverage software to meet their delivery needs. What is contactless delivery? Contactless services are everywhere today, but it used to be a service only provided by e-commerce shippers. However, many brick-and-mortar businesses had to switch to contactless delivery to keep their doors open during the pandemic. Now, customers can get a contactless pizza delivered to their homes without even opening their door to a driver. After experiencing the convenience of contactless delivery, customers rsquo desire for this physically distant approach doesn rsquo t look to be waning. nbsp How does contactless delivery work? Contactless delivery is the practice of providing a product with limited or no contact between the delivering party and the customer. Take the many food delivery and meal prep companies popular today. Drivers can leave orders on the recipient rsquo s doorstep and notify them by text or by ringing a doorbell, without any in-person interaction. Essentially, the customer places an order and selects ldquo contactless delivery. rdquo They complete the payment and the business makes arrangements to deliver that product or good to the customer without interacting with the delivery driver. Of course, there are some goods that can rsquo t be easily delivered without contact. These include alcohol, prescription drugs, or items that require identity or age confirmation. Yet a business may be able to digitize the validation process to enable no-contact deliveries. For instance, CVS recently teamed up with UPS to use drones to deliver prescriptions to a Florida retirement community. What does contactless delivery mean for commercial fleets and drivers? nbsp That it rsquo s time to go digital if you haven rsquo t already. Fleet automation software makes contactless delivery attainable for commercial trucking companies. Automation helps businesses communicate throughout delivery while minimizing interaction among drivers, dispatch, and others. The fleet can also ensure proper driver safety when doing contactless deliveries by Requiring appropriate personal protective equipment PPE such as gloves and mask. Educating drivers about how to wear the PPE properly. The mask should cover both mouth and nose, and gloves should cover both wrists. Storing hand sanitizer on delivery trucks and recommending its regular use. Doing temperature checks of all drivers before they work a route. Keeping fulfillment centers disinfected and at a high level of cleanliness. Encouraging social distancing among employees and within areas where drivers meet or congregate. Benefits of contactless deliveries Non-contact delivery offers several advantages for everyone involved. Top benefits of contactless delivery include Business survival. During the pandemic, providing a contactless delivery option was the only way many organizations could continue to do business. Today, no-contact delivery remains a differentiator that can help grow a customer base and profitability. Convenience. Customers like the option of contactless delivery, especially when it means they don rsquo t have to be available and onsite for the arrival of their products or goods. Many customers prefer this option as long as you can keep them updated. Safety. Your customers and employees face a reduced risk of virus spread when you minimize in-person interactions. Plus, employees see you care, and your business benefits from avoiding the disruption of employee sick days. Brand loyalty improves. By going digital to inform customers about their deliveries and offering contactless delivery, you rsquo re able to offer a more satisfying customer experience. Reduced touch points. Transactions for contactless delivery take place online, via web or in an app, or people may pre-pay by phone. Online transactions make payment processing safer and faster, and are particularly appealing to younger generations . Is contactless delivery here to stay? Even with the increase in immunization levels and sanitization measures, many businesses are finding demand for contactless delivery remains. Customers find it convenient, and that rsquo s a big driver of purchasing behaviors. Enterprises such as Amazon and Domino rsquo s are among those examining new ways to offer contactless delivery, including via robot, drone, and even parachute . In our digital society, the continuation of contactless delivery seems inevitable. Challenges associated with non-contact delivery Contactless deliveries offer many advantages for the business, its employees, and its customers. Still, it further complicates the already difficult last-mile delivery . Some challenges to address include Customers not being aware the delivery has been made. Deliveries being made to the wrong location. nbsp Disputes about whether the deliveries were actually received. Any of these challenges can mean a lot of back-and-forth between the customer, sender, and your company. With a delivery software solution, your business can more easily avoid or deal with these issues. nbsp Learn how fleet management software benefits field service and construction fleets too. Features to look for in enterprise contactless delivery software Contactless delivery software has many features that can help manage your delivery system and improve communication between the office, drivers, and customers. It rsquo s best to look for a solution that offers Automated notifications. A system that lets you set up automatic notifications sent via SMS text or email can help fleet managers, drivers, and customers all stay in the know. GPS tracking. Fleet managers can keep tabs on where their vehicles are and ensure deliveries are run more smoothly. GPS tracking also supports automated notifications as they can be triggered by geofencing . Route optimization. Drawing on data about routes, traffic and weather conditions, and information about delivery site drop-off windows can help simplify route planning. Driver app. Offer drivers an intuitive app that lets them see customer delivery instructions, submit photos of the completed delivery, and send messages to the back office. An app that helps drivers monitor vehicle health and Hours of Service compliance also helps whether or not the delivery is no-contact. nbsp Read our route plannin g tips to enhance your contactless and other delivery services.

            "The internet accounts for 3.7 of global greenhouse gas emissions , so digital isn rsquo t exactly winning the war on global warming. However, there rsquo s another side to this story. One where the internet rsquo s capabilities are driving sustainable outcomes for businesses across the globe. With the help of the Internet of Things IoT , industrial businesses are reducing emissions, conserving fuel, and producing less waste. ldquo Digital can be an engine of sustainability if it rsquo s positioned effectively and at the center of your strategy, rdquo writes Gartner, the Fortune 500 research company . In its ldquo Billions of better decisions rdquo report, global technology company ABB reached the same conclusion. nbsp To learn how companies are using technology to become more sustainable, ABB held 765 discussions with senior managers and executives from 12 industrial segments, including oil and gas , automotive, and food and beverage. Ninety-six percent of all respondents said digitization is essential to meeting corporate sustainability goals. Seventy-two percent of them said they rsquo ve increased their IoT spending to support sustainable initiatives. It rsquo s all evidence of the symbiotic relationship between digital and sustainability. ldquo Sustainability and digital aren rsquo t merely related. They rsquo re dependent on one another, rdquo says Cody Falcon, Global Product Manager, Digital Platform and Applications, for ABB. ldquo It rsquo s difficult to recognize progress in your sustainability initiatives unless you have a core foundation of digital. rdquo nbsp Important takeaways from ABB rsquo s ldquo Billions of better decisions rdquo survey show that the key to becoming more sustainable is a sound digital strategy. A single strategy that unifies digital and sustainability is the answer IoT has been around for a while. However, by allowing fleets to meet their environmental goals more easily, advances in cloud computing have upped the game. Characterized by automation and connectivity, IoT connects equipment, cloud computing, mobile apps, and analytics. The automatic and near-constant data transferral leads to real-time results in the field and at the office. ldquo Bringing digital prowess and sustainable practices together should be at the forefront of strategic thinking for any business mdash as a way to differentiate itself and gain long-term viability among customers, regulators, and the communities where businesses operate, rdquo writes Strategy Business magazine in the article ldquo Digital Technology and Sustainability Positive Reinforcement. rdquo nbsp Thanks to innovation, the Internet of Things has become more practical over time. Reliable sensors are opening the door to low-cost, low-power solutions. Machine learning and analytics allow businesses to access data more easily. Cloud computing platforms give companies access to the infrastructure they need to scale up. If the Internet of Things has opened the door to more practical ways of working, sustainable initiatives have led to their own positive results. ldquo Benefits are being realized across the entire supply chain, rdquo Falcon says. ldquo Sustainable initiatives have led to gains in compliance, reduced carbon emissions, real-time safety reporting, and better visibility. As companies progress in their sustainability initiatives, profits and productivity increase. Companies are saying they couldn rsquo t achieve what they do without the digital baseline that they rsquo ve built over the last 10 to 15 years. rdquo nbsp ABB rsquo s survey shows that 75 of companies have a documented sustainability strategy. Of that 75 , more than 90 believe their sustainability strategy is somewhat or very comprehensive. ldquo Of course, publishing a sustainability strategy and putting it on your website is the easy part, rdquo Falcon says. ldquo Managing, monitoring, and reporting on progress quarterly is the hard part. rdquo Digital tech enhances sustainability In its ldquo Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Earth rdquo report, PricewaterhouseCoopers PwC identifies more than 80 ways that artificial intelligence AI -based applications can be used to benefit the environment. Improving fuel economy, mitigating risk, and reducing emissions are just a few examples the report mentions. ldquo AI in particular has immense potential to help unlock solutions, rdquo PwC rsquo s report states. ldquo In addition to enhancing current efforts to address environmental issues, there is enormous potential to create AI-enabled lsquo game changers rsquo in which the application of AI, often in combination with other Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, has the potential to deliver transformative solutions. rdquo In the commercial transportation world, machine learning algorithms ldquo look for patterns in transport demand, optimizing routes and improving efficiency and safety, rdquo PwC states in its report. While connected AVs present opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future, so do the AI-based technologies of today. nbsp Motive rsquo s AI-driven fuel insights , for example, help fleets cut idling by up to 20 and save fleets up to 10 on fuel costs. Such capabilities allow customers to lighten their carbon footprint and shut down fuel-wasting habits quickly. In trucking, automated compliance management is helping to reduce hours of service violations, improve safety , and eliminate paper waste. 85 of companies surveyed are mature in their digital practice or rapidly scaling it As one who spends every day in the trenches with customers and partners, Falcon finds the 85 statistic above hard to believe. ldquo If I were to look at my thousands of customers on the maturity curve, rdquo says Falcon, ldquo the balance would look like an evenly distributed scatter plot. rdquo Nevertheless, 34 of ABB rsquo s survey respondents said they rsquo ve implemented IoT at scale, and 51 said they rsquo ve started implementing IoT at scale. ldquo So, more than 80 are either mature in IoT or starting to scale it. This is really shocking, rdquo Falcon says. ldquo I encourage you to think about this figure as a benchmark. Even if this statistic is slightly off due to self-reporting, if 85 of your peers and competitors say they rsquo re mature and rapidly scaling their digital practice, reflect internally on where you think you are against that. nbsp ldquo Have conversations with colleagues, collaborators, and partners about how to ramp up scaling to at least keep pace, rdquo Falcon adds. ldquo Because I can tell you, the leaders in this space aren rsquo t standing still. Everyone is investing heavily and running the race. You rsquo re either going to keep pace or be left behind. rdquo It rsquo s best to be practical about data selection Data is critical to helping executives make informed decisions, but data alone won rsquo t solve anything. Businesses need a way to put data into context. ldquo Don rsquo t collect data just to say you have an enterprise data strategy, rdquo Falcon cautions. ldquo Really pursue the data and contextualize it to solve the problems of the business. rdquo This is where working with a managed service can be beneficial. A managed service such as Motive contextualizes data for you. That means fleet managers can address their most pressing responsibilities while Motive sifts through the data and shows you exactly where to focus. Investing in IoT isn rsquo t only about financial gains anymore. It rsquo s about sustainability. ABB rsquo s survey highlights the top factors driving executive investment in IoT, such as cost savings, productivity, and safety. Falcon notes the speed with which sustainability has shot toward the top of the list, driving investment in IoT right behind operational efficiency and productivity. ldquo I will tell you for a fact that sustainability was number eight on this list just a few years ago. It was in the bottom of the top 10, rdquo Falcon says. ldquo To see that sustainability is number three of the key drivers for digital investments, it s interesting, and I would bet in the next year or two it will take the number one or number two spot. rdquo According to a recent Forbes article, ldquo Why corporate strategies should be focused on sustainability , rdquo 90 of executives believe sustainability is important, yet only 60 of businesses have a sustainability strategy. One reason for this, the article states, is that ldquo CEOs and corporate boards are not as engaged as they should be with sustainability strategies. rdquo There rsquo s no doubt that sustainability is top of mind for executives. ldquo Many corporate leaders are becoming aware of the need to reuse and recycle and are moving toward the circular economy, rdquo Forbes writes. ldquo It is a huge area for growth as well, with the renewable energy market expected to be 2.15 trillion by 2025. rdquo What rsquo s good for the planet is good for profits The fifth key takeaway from ABB rsquo s ldquo Billions of Better Decisions rdquo report counters the legacy thinking that companies must choose between saving the planet or saving the business. ldquo That rsquo s no longer the case today, rdquo Falcon says. ldquo Sustainability is one of today rsquo s business differentiators, and reporting transparency is driving competition. rdquo Falcon reiterates that publishing a sustainability plan is the easy part. ldquo The hard part is doing the real work of measuring against the target and reporting quarterly progress. Look at reports your competitors are publishing, rdquo he says, ldquo then use them to benchmark your own progress. Sustainability is a business differentiator and a business driver. It rsquo s no longer a tradeoff. It rsquo s a true win-win. rdquo\n",

            "As the Safe Driver Apprenticeship Program prepares to launch, Co-Director of Scopelitis Transportation Consulting Steve Keppler explores the program rsquo s impacts on safety and recruitment. In signing the 1.2 trillion infrastructure bill into law, President Biden opened a window of opportunity for U.S. builders and skilled workers. With 110 billion allocated for U.S. roads and bridges, the legislation promises a windfall of construction projects over the next several years. For the fleets participating in the Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot Program , the bill rsquo s impacts could be felt much sooner than that. As soon as this fall. When Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA Acting Administrator Robin Hutcheson recently appeared before a Senate committee, she touted the pilot program rsquo s potential to create ldquo a better, safer pipeline of drivers . rdquo nbsp Nonetheless, safety advocates have expressed concern that young drivers lack the training, awareness, and experience necessary to operate an 18-wheeler safely. To weigh the program rsquo s merits, we turned to Steve Keppler, co-director of Scopelitis Transportation Consulting . He explores what the apprenticeship program could mean for the driver shortage, road safety, and trucking rsquo s future. Safety is an important value of the apprenticeship program nbsp The Safe Driver Apprenticeship Program is a provision of the infrastructure bill, signed into law in November 2021. The provision allows up to 3,000 CDL holders aged 18 to 20 to haul freight in interstate commerce. The only caveat is that apprenticed drivers must drive alongside an experienced truck driver who is 26 or older. nbsp While safety groups worry that 18- to 20-year-olds aren rsquo t equipped to make safe driving decisions , Keppler says provisions in the driver apprenticeship program prioritize road safety. nbsp ldquo The program is designed for young drivers to succeed, rdquo he says. ldquo For individuals joining the trucking industry right out of high school, the driver apprenticeship program provides an informed introduction to commercial driving. One that ensures young drivers and others on the road will be as safe as possible. rdquo Keppler points to important restrictions the program puts on apprenticed drivers. First, during a two-tiered probationary period, apprentices must log 400 hours of supervised training. Young drivers aren rsquo t permitted to transport hazardous materials, and perhaps most significantly, all vehicles must be equipped with a dash cam , a crash mitigation system, automatic braking, and a speed governor. nbsp ldquo The fact that these safety technologies are mandated is a testament to their value, rdquo Keppler says. nbsp One study from Motive shows the difference fleet safety innovations can make. In the study, fleets that coached drivers frequently with the help of dash cams experienced 69 fewer unsafe driving behaviors and 22 fewer FMCSA-reported collisions. They also saw 67 fewer harsh driving events, 31 fewer speeding events, and a 40 reduction in unsafe driving violations. nbsp ldquo A big part of being a safe driver is having safe habits, rdquo Keppler says. ldquo No one has necessarily taught these young drivers the right way, the safe way, to drive. This program is a much more intense, focused effort to teach young drivers safe habits from the very beginning. It rsquo s a supervised effort that relies on safety technologies that we know work. rdquo nbsp In the Safe Driver Pilot Program, apprentices will receive supervised driving instruction in every aspect of trucking. They rsquo ll learn how to drive on the interstate and two-lane highways, experience the differences in daytime and nighttime driving, and take to urban roads. They rsquo ll learn how to make safe lane changes, create space around the vehicle, and comply with ELD regulations . All the while, an experienced CDL holder will instruct them from the passenger seat, and the latest innovations will reinforce road safety. Safety technology plays a key role in cultivating safe driving habits Typically, it takes years for commercial drivers to develop safe habits. Because the apprenticeship program allows drivers to learn from safety innovations, unsafe driving habits are never given the opportunity to take root. Dash cams are ldquo hugely valuable rdquo as driver training and coaching tools, Keppler says. ldquo They provide video evidence that lets you go back and say, lsquo Look at what happened there. Look at how you can improve next time. rsquo All of the technologies featured in the pilot program accelerate the knowledge of drivers to help them improve more quickly. rdquo nbsp The FMCSA chose technologies for the pilot program that promote the safe operation of a vehicle or make it easier to drive. Each vehicle in the pilot program will have an automatic transmission, for example, so apprentices can focus on driving instead of shifting gears. nbsp How safe is it for 18-year-olds to drive semis? There isn rsquo t much data on drivers in the 18- to 20-year-old age bracket, and safety groups worry that 3,000 18- to 20-year-olds won rsquo t have the awareness needed to drive interstate highways safely. Research done by the American Transportation Research Institute ATRI on young drivers has been promising but limited. nbsp To address safety advocates rsquo concerns, FMCSA will conduct a study on the safe driver apprenticeship program and provide a report to Congress, Keppler says. ldquo One of the big questions out there is where the insurance companies sit on this. Are they going to insure these young drivers, and if so, to what degree? rdquo The apprenticeships hardly constitute the first time 18- to 20-year-olds have driven big rigs, Keppler notes. People in the age group already can operate Class 8 vehicles as freight haulers in all 50 states. They rsquo re just not permitted to cross state lines. nbsp ldquo We allow drivers to drive 500 miles across some states, but they can rsquo t drive five miles between one state and another, rdquo Keppler observes. ldquo The Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot Program helps get individuals involved in the industry right out of high school. It helps them establish safe driving habits right out of the gate. And hopefully, they rsquo ll stay in the industry and cultivate those good habits for the rest of their careers. rdquo For a regulatory point of view on the Safe Driver Apprenticeship Program, check out this blog post from Travis Baskin, head of Regulatory Affairs at Motive.

            "Learn about electric buses and how they work Electric bus charging is an important element of the sustainable public transit solution Considering advantages and disadvantages can help you maximize electric bus operations Global concerns over urban air quality and carbon emissions are prompting public transit to reconsider energy sources. Municipalities looking for potential operational cost savings are also considering electric buses. nbsp But what is an electric bus, and how does it work? This guide will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of electric buses, and provide more insights into sustainable public transport. What is an electrical bus? An electric bus is a passenger transit vehicle powered by an electric motor. Instead of an internal combustion engine, electric buses store the electricity needed to power the vehicle in a battery. As a result, an electric bus is also called a battery-electric bus BEB . The electric motor serves as both the engine and transmission. The electric bus is popular in China, where 17 of the country rsquo s total fleet was a BEB in 2019. While there were 421,000 buses on the road in mainland China, there were only 300 in the U.S. and 2,250 in Europe . How do electric buses work? A signal is sent to the powertrain system controller upon starting the bus. That signal powers up the high-voltage battery and converts it into electrical energy, which powers the electric motor and thermal management system. The battery is effectively the fuel tank of the electric bus. So, the size of the battery correlates to how far the bus can go without recharging. nbsp How the bus is used also factors into the battery charge, known as its duty cycle. You might think of a duty cycle this way A light-duty cycle is taking a leisurely walk along a paved, flat path. A medium-duty cycle is taking a more hilly path while pushing an infant in a stroller and pulling a dog along. A heavy-duty cycle is running with a double stroller and holding two kindergarteners up a steep incline, against the wind. A light-duty cycle will burn a lot less energy than a heavy-duty cycle. Along with your speed, weight transported, and road conditions, other factors can impact the duty cycle of electric buses. Factors include driving and weather conditions, the number of stops and starts, elevation changes, how quickly the bus accelerates, and more. How fast can an electrical bus go? Most electric buses are operated in urban environments. They don rsquo t need to go at highway speed. They can reach 40 to 45 mph but will average lower speeds. The higher the speed, the shorter the range. How long does charging an electric bus take? The time it takes for an electric bus to fully charge depends on the type of charger. There are two main types of electric bus chargers plug-in chargers and pantograph chargers. nbsp A plug-in charger can charge an electric bus in two to eight hours. The charger can be either direct current DC or alternating current AC . AC chargers are slower but more affordable, while DC chargers can charge batteries up to 150 KW. A pantograph charger is more powerful. The buses drive underneath the robotic arm of a pantograph charger, which attaches to the electrical conductors on top of the vehicle for a quick charge. These types of stations may be found on a bus rsquo s route to enable electric bus charging without the driver having to return to the lot. Pantograph chargers carry more current for faster charging. They use DC that can charge up to 350 KW. nbsp How much does an electric bus charging station cost? The cost of an electric bus charging station depends on the type of charge used. A DC charger is more expensive, as the voltage is higher and more volatile. nbsp According to one estimate, plug-in chargers can cost nbsp between 2,000 and 5,000 for the equipment, and 1,000 to over 10,000 for installation, nbsp depending on the complexity. Meanwhile, DC fast chargers are more expensive at around 10,000 to 15,000 for more basic equipment, and more than 40,000 for larger, more powerful stations. They also require a three-phase power supply, so installation costs are typically higher as well mdash ranging from 4,000 to 15,000 on the lower end to over 50,000 for larger, more complex projects. Keep in mind that one charger can service six to eight buses per hour , depending on route scheduling. Advantages of electric buses The many advantages of electric buses help explain their growing popularity. Let rsquo s look at some of the main ones in greater detail. Environmental benefits Electric vehicles are more energy efficient and have zero carbon emissions. This not only helps public health but can reduce the risk of global warming. Lower operation and maintenance costs Electric buses don rsquo t need to gas up. The battery is their fuel. And without the internal combustion engine or diesel fuel, you can expect lower maintenance costs. The useful lifespan of an electric bus is around 12 years, per manufacturer Gregory Poole . Smoother, quieter ride If you rsquo re at a NASCAR event, you rsquo re expecting to hear the roar of the engine. However, passenger transit riders don rsquo t need to hear that gas-guzzling engine rsquo s roar. Instead, they can enjoy a quieter, zippier ride around the city while commuting to work or getting to school. Regenerative braking When drivers apply the brakes on an electric bus, they give the battery more juice. The bus is designed to capture that kinetic energy and put it back into the battery. This helps the bus to run more efficiently and lowers wear on the braking system. No overhead wires Electric trolleys, which you may have seen in Zurich in Switzerland, or San Francisco in the United States, or Toronto in Canada, get their power from the overhead wires. Electric buses, on the other hand, store the electricity needed in batteries. Still, there are disadvantages of electric buses. We address these concerns next. Disadvantages of electric buses We rsquo ve discussed the advantages of electric buses, but there are some disadvantages to consider too. As technology advances, expect manufacturers to continue to address these issues. Higher purchase price Since the technology is still new and only a few electric bus manufacturers exist, the prices are higher. Additionally, you rsquo ll need to factor in the price of the electric charging stations. Charging time It doesn rsquo t take long to fill up a diesel fuel tank, but it can take hours to charge an electric bus. A fast charge electric bus may be able to restore an hour rsquo s worth of energy usage within 10 minutes. However, that battery will have a diminished operation range. Limited range Electric buses can only go so far before they need to recharge. Mass Transit defines an Extended Range Battery-Electric Bus as one that can operate for over 80 miles before it needs to recharge. Unlike diesel buses, electric buses need to use an electric charging station to recharge, which can be more inconvenient to find compared to a diesel gas station. Weather road conditions can impact buses Electric buses can be challenged by extreme weather conditions or hilly routes. Bloomberg reported the Minnesota Valley Transportation Authority MVTA had difficulties with electric buses maintaining a full day rsquo s charge in the cold of winter. Electric buses vs. diesel buses As already discussed, when comparing electric buses to diesel buses, the cost is a big factor. The electric bus is more expensive upfront, although there are many manufacturer incentive programs. You rsquo ll save money over the life of the electric bus, as you can enjoy lower fuel costs and maintenance costs. With diesel buses, you don rsquo t have to worry about range or about the road and weather conditions. Top electric bus companies Verified Market Research predicts positive growth in the global electric bus market in the near future. Having valued the market at nbsp USD 102.71 thousand in 2018, VMR projected the market will reach nbsp USD 686.31 thousand by 2026, nbsp growing at a nbsp CAGR of 26.8 from 2019 to 2026.

            "Commercial fleets are combating a truck driver shortage Understanding why can help your fleet address the challenge Knowing what your drivers need can help attract talent to your fleet American Trucking Associations Chief Economist Bob Costello has to be getting used to delivering bad news about the truck driver shortage. The ATA states that the current driver shortage is rising to a 80,000 shortfall, ldquo an all-time high for the industry. rdquo nbsp But there are steps commercial fleets can take to help fix the truck driver shortage. Is there a truck driver shortage? You rsquo re not alone in feeling that there rsquo s a truck driver shortage. In fact, it rsquo s supposed to get worse. If hiring trends aren rsquo t turned around, Costello estimates ldquo the shortage could surpass 160,000 in 2030. rdquo The ATA concludes, ldquo in order to keep up with demand over the next decade, trucking will need to recruit nearly one million new drivers in order to close the gap. rdquo Why is there a truck driver shortage? What is causing the truck driver shortage? The reasons include Increased demand for freight. Experienced drivers retiring. According to the nbsp Bureau of Labor Statistics , the average age of a commercial truck driver in the U.S. is 55 years old. Shortage of new entrants into the career. The idea of trucking as a male career. Redwood Logistics states that ldquo women make up 47 of the nation rsquo s workforce but only account for 6 of commercial truck drivers . rdquo Low retention rates for drivers. nbsp Pandemic pressures, such as the closure of truck driving schools and DMVs. Wait times for commercial driver rsquo s license courses have increased. This all adds up to what the ATA describes as ldquo tremendous pressure on the driver pool. rdquo Then, there rsquo s the surge in demand brought on by COVID-19 changes. ldquo A thing to note about the shortage is that before the pandemic, we were adding drivers to the industry mdash even though we had a shortage, more people were entering the industry, rdquo says Costello. ldquo The issue is that new entrants into the industry didn rsquo t keep up with demand for goods. rdquo Retention and recruiting are difficult. Drivers are under constant pressure and work long hours in tough conditions. ldquo The average annual turnover rate for long haul drivers at big firms is 90 , rdquo according to the ATA . The upside is that there are steps commercial fleets can take to make the job more satisfying, less stressful, and safer . Keep drivers safe with these tips for avoiding driver fatigue . How bad is the truck driver shortage? The truck driver shortage is making headlines globally, and is one of the factors attributed to the worldwide supply chain crisis. With containers idling in ports and packages delayed for months, commercial fleets are under great pressure to get cargo moving. Yet every logistics manager knows that there rsquo s only so much you can transport without drivers in the trucks. ldquo We have an aging workforce, a workforce that is overwhelmingly male and finding ways to address those issues is key to narrowing the shortage, rdquo says Costello. How to solve the truck driver shortage With the truck driver shortage making it difficult to get products from and to store shelves, and the supply chain crisis driving up prices, even the U.S. government is working to address the issue. The Drive-SAFE Act , signed into law in November 2021, establishes an apprenticeship program for young adults, who are already eligible to hold CDLs and operate Class 8 tractors, to get involved in interstate long haul trucking. At the same time, there are many ways commercial fleets can adjust to the continued tightness in the driver market. Many fleets are increasing driver pay. ldquo The industry is raising pay at five times the historic average, rdquo says Costello. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the median pay for a truck driver in America is 48,310 per year . Freight operators are also offering large signing bonuses to address the shortage. That has average weekly earnings for long-haul truckload drivers up over 25 from the beginning of 2019. Spending less time on the road is another solution. This may sound counterintuitive when the issue isn rsquo t enough drivers. But keeping drivers on more localized routes can help reduce burnout and improve their work-life balance as well. Prioritizing recruitment is also critical. Commercial fleets are doing more now to recruit minorities, women, and veterans to their driving ranks. Efforts include offering paid training programs and making the job more attractive by recognizing what drivers need to succeed. Important things a truck driver needs Better work-life balance is an employee priority across industries, and commercial fleets can rsquo t get away with ignoring it. Drivers also want better working conditions. Fortunately, current technologies makes it easier for your commercial fleet to provide drivers with the tools they need. Start with safety. Drivers are on the road all the time. Anything your fleet can do to make the job safer for them will help with driver recruitment and driver retention . Strategies can include training new drivers to bring them up to expert levels more efficiently. Or coaching tools that support drivers while they rsquo re out on the road. Some electronic logging devices, such as Motive rsquo s ELD, can monitor driver behaviors to identify issues in near real time and flag individual drivers who might need further guidance. Streamlining processes can also improve the truck driver rsquo s work experience. With the right ELD technology, fleets can nbsp Standardize pre-trip vehicle inspections . Simplify logging Hours of Service HOS . Instantly communicate with managers and customers, all within an app. Upload documentation for greater accountability and to expedite inspections. Give drivers peace of mind with a backup record that can prove their innocence in accidents. Automate dispatch for more efficient trips. Optimize shipments to ensure efficiency and safe loading and unloading. How drivers can help you combat truck driver shortages While commercial fleets work to address the driver shortage, don rsquo t underestimate the impact drivers can have as well. Word of mouth is your best recruitment tool. Meeting your drivers rsquo needs and providing them with positive working conditions will have your team speaking highly of your fleet. The fleet might also implement a referral program to encourage current drivers to bring others on board. nbsp Applying tips for retaining truck drivers with Motive The truck driver shortage is a complex issue. Commercial fleets have many daily operations to monitor and manage. Retention and recruitment is only one of the challenges. Nevertheless, an all-in-one fleet management software can make a real difference in your efforts to combat driver turnover and bring new people onboard. Motive rsquo s telematics make it easier to keep assets moving. Maximizing vehicle uptime with maintenance and performance reporting supports driver efficiency and improves vehicle safety. Plus, GPS tracking helps increase productivity with ongoing route optimization . Geofence alerts also give drivers support in theft prevention while out on a route. Make it easier for drivers to do their job using the Motive Driver App . Logs and inspection reports can be less time-consuming when drivers use the Driver App to keep up. Drivers can use pre-existing templates for inspections, upload necessary documentation, track their hours, or communicate with the back office. The app helps keep drivers on the road as well. or off of it when they need to be. Pre-violation alerts notify drivers of impending HOS violations , giving them time to find a place to park. The Motive AI Dashcam and automated coaching technology also works to prevent accidents and protect drivers . The AI Dashcam detects unsafe driving behavior with unrivaled accuracy, and alerts drivers in real time.Your drivers will know you take their safety and professional development seriously with Motive rsquo s turnkey coaching workflow and Safety Scores. nbsp Fleet management can also use metrics from the Safety Hub to identify drivers with excellent risk scores.

            "Matt Abeles, VP of Construction Technology and Innovation for ABC, talks about ABC rsquo s Safety Technology Guide and the best safety tools for contractors. For America rsquo s more than 7.5 million construction workers, a culture of safety must be part of the job. Working in construction presents clear safety challenges, from working at height to trenching. Items that construction workers handle on a jobsite are often sharp, heavy, or hot. Today rsquo s construction safety experts aren rsquo t just using gloves and goggles to protect workers. Digital transformation via innovative technologies is helping to improve construction safety in ways we couldn rsquo t have imagined just a few years ago. The Bureau of Labor Statistics ranks construction third among the country rsquo s most dangerous jobs. Given the construction profession rsquo s risks, safety technology has become vital in construction, even as the industry continues to realize technology rsquo s potential. ldquo To prevent injuries and fatalities, contractors must approach safety proactively, rdquo says Matt Abeles, Vice President of Construction Technology and Innovation for Associated Builders and Contractors ABC . ldquo One way to do that, and emphasize safety as a key pillar of company culture, is through technology. Proactive safety measures are exactly what we had in mind in releasing our Safety Technology Guide . Multiple solutions exist to ensure a safer jobsite, and these technologies can be intuitive and cost effective. rdquo nbsp For ABC rsquo s 21,000 members, 97 of which are small to mid-sized contractors, the Safety Technology Guide makes it easier to sift through new safety solutions to find the options that best serve their business. Today rsquo s construction innovations protect workers from overheating, falls, equipment-based injuries, and even road-related accidents. nbsp Advances in automation, artificial intelligence AI , sensors, data collection, and virtual reality are improving safety and saving lives . Here rsquo s a look at some of the most innovative safety technologies that are driving digital transformation in construction, and how they re strengthening the safety culture for contractors. The rise of automation At one point, automation was a distant dream. Now, construction firms that haven rsquo t automated their processes look like relics. Worse, they rsquo re putting their crews in danger. Automation is reducing the chance of injury on the job. Self-driving machines, for example, are used to haul heavy materials across a jobsite. Drones automatically scan areas for potential hazards. And robots are assigned repetitive tasks, eliminating the chance of fatigue or injury for workers. nbsp ldquo Making the switch to automation isn rsquo t a matter of choice for construction firms, it rsquo s a must, rdquo Abeles says. ldquo As one of the largest industries in the country, construction must be one of the most innovative. Contractors need to build more sustainable processes now or risk falling behind later. rdquo nbsp Now is the time to move into mainstream safety technologies . ldquo Digital forms and apps allow contractors to capture, track and report safety data, rdquo Abeles says. ldquo These tools exist, and they rsquo re game-changers for contractors looking to grow in the face of the nbsp skilled labor shortage and demands of inflation. rdquo Digital solutions for project estimation, scheduling, asset tracking, and project status allow contractors to work faster and smarter. Abeles suggests that contractors automate their most time-consuming processes first, then build from there. ldquo Any digital solution that fits with a firm rsquo s business strategy and long-term plans would be a good buy, rdquo he says. Explore Motive s construction fleet management solution. Artificial intelligence nbsp As more technology providers enter construction, they rsquo re bringing with them AI-based solutions that are modernizing the industry. AI is able to take huge data sets, recognize patterns, and build predictive models that users can rely on to prevent delays and identify important trends. This is a big step for digital transformation in construction. Motive rsquo s AI Dashcam , for example, captures unsafe driving behaviors on video, then uses AI to alert to the same risky patterns in the future. When a contractor en route to a jobsite follows another vehicle too closely, AI instantly alerts the driver to create space around the vehicle. If a driver gets distracted or reaches for a cell phone, the AI Dashcam alerts the driver to keep their eyes on the road. As Kathleen Walch writes for Forbes, AI capabilities like these can save lives. ldquo Increasingly, construction sites are being equipped with cameras, IoT devices, and sensors that monitor many aspects of construction operations , rdquo Walch writes in the article AI Transforming the Construction Industry . ldquo AI-enabled systems are able to watch what rsquo s going on 24 7 without distraction. With facial recognition and object recognition technology, AI systems are capable of detecting unsafe behavior and alerting the construction team of potential hazards. Not only does this reduce liability, but it can save lives and increase efficiency. rdquo nbsp Cloud-based software nbsp ldquo The cloud rdquo is a centralized server that contains files that can be accessed online from anywhere. Cloud-based software in construction gives contractors real-time access to information right from the jobsite. Cloud-based software is changing the way contractors work. It allows companies to track the location of equipment, vehicles, and staff. It also enables real-time information sharing. nbsp ldquo Contractors are using cloud-based software to become more productive, profitable, and proactive, rdquo Abeles says. ldquo Purpose-built solutions are helping contractors achieve more from day-to-day, creating more opportunities for them to win work and do it safely. rdquo nbsp Safety apps The Construction Technology Report from JB Knowledge notes that smartphones, relied upon by 90 of construction workers, are the most-used technology on jobsites. The report also states that 49 of construction workers use mobile apps for safety. Apps are being used to organize safety meetings, report near-misses, increase awareness, and monitor workers rsquo health. The SafeSite app endorsed by ABC in its Safety Technology Guide helps in performing inspections, reporting incidents, and hosting ldquo toolbox talks rdquo about jobsite safety. ABC defines toolbox talks as ldquo brief, single-topic training sessions of 15 to 30 minutes held on the jobsite for all employees. rdquo In its recently released nbsp Safety Performance Report , ABC says that companies that conduct toolbox talks every day reduce their Total Recordable Incident Rate TRIR by 76 and Days Away Restricted or Transferred DART rates by 79 . That rsquo s in comparison to firms that hold toolbox talks once per month. Virtual reality Virtual reality programs let people nbsp walk on the moon and nbsp visit far-away places . They also ensure that contractors learn how to build in a safe environment. VR, as virtual reality is often called, simulates dangerous situations and fatal mistakes so that contractors can avoid the same catastrophes in real life. nbsp Crews can use VR simulations to preview potentially risky scenarios and understand how to adjust to them. As a result, teams anywhere can ldquo walk through rdquo a site and examine potential hazards before ever setting foot on a jobsite. nbsp A study from the financial advisory firm PwC shows that virtual reality learners train four times faster than those trained in a classroom setting. Virtual learners also feel four times as focused and more emotionally connected to content than other types of learners. Takeaways from virtual lessons can be applied to actual construction projects, continuously improving safety across a project or an organization. Smart sensors A typical construction project has its share of risks. One way to mitigate these risks is to install smart sensors. Known to monitor everything from air quality to body temperature, sensor-laden equipment can be pivotal to saving lives. Smart hard hats, for example, have sensors that monitor vital signs and fatigue levels. Smart boots can track location, movement, fatigue, and falls. Smart watches even make it easier to communicate from the field. nbsp ldquo Increasingly, modern machines and equipment are adding various sensors to help with the overall function and operation of the complicated and expensive machinery, rdquo writes Kathleen Walch in nbsp the Forbes article . ldquo These sensors can monitor a variety of different conditions relevant to construction, such as temperature, engine condition, and aspects of application of materials. These tools are able to analyze data in real time and predict with a high degree of certainty problems, delays, or malfunctions that might occur. rdquo Exoskeleton suits An nbsp exoskeleton suit , often made of metal, enhances contractors rsquo strength as they move heavy equipment. The suit makes it easier to lift heavy objects and reduces strain on the body. Exoskeleton suits can be full bodysuits or protect specific areas of the body, such as the hands or shoulders. Originally, exoskeleton suits were used nbsp to assist in rehabilitation for stroke and spinal cord patients. In construction and manufacturing, they rsquo re used to reduce injury and fatigue and lighten the load. Drug and alcohol detection ABC rsquo s Safety Performance Report states that one-third of all safety incidents on construction jobsites involve alcohol or drugs. When firms handle drug and alcohol offenses proactively, safety tends to improve. ABC rsquo s Safety Performance Report, for example, shows that robust substance abuse prevention programs with provisions for drug and alcohol testing make a difference. According to the report, such programs have led to a 70 reduction in TRIR and a 73 reduction in DART rates among contractors. Proactive solutions like those in the Safety Technology Guide can monitor impairment from fatigue, prescriptions, alcohol, and illicit drugs. In as fast as one minute, drug and alcohol tools can check users rsquo eyes to detect alterations in pupillary response, providing results instantly. nbsp Get started with construction safety tech today For firms new to safety technology, the guidance in ABC rsquo s Safety Technology Guide is a great starting point. It shows how to identify, choose, and implement technology to achieve a safer jobsite. Here rsquo s ABC rsquo s step-by-step guidance for contractors planning to invest in digital transformation in construction. Start small, testing technology on one or two projects before rolling it out across all jobs. Assign a technology champion who is responsible for successfully implementing the technology. Understand that technology must be a priority. Celebrate small wins and recognize success on any scale when innovating. Strategize a rollout to meet end users where they are. Identify necessary training for any technology and how that will be completed. Create opportunities for employees to connect with one another to strengthen a more inclusive culture, improve safety , and raise efficiency with technology.

            "Oil is a global fuel with many common modes of transportation Modes of oil transportation vary depending on circumstances Fleet management technology can help secure oil transportation Even with growing momentum for renewable energy sources, the dominance of oil isn rsquo t at risk any time soon. For one thing, a majority of the world has only just begun consuming oil. And in the developed nations, the demand for oil is only growing. Moving this important fuel is subject to safety regulations, regardless of the mode of oil transportation . This article will focus primarily on challenges faced by the trucking industry. What are the most common ways of transporting oil? Trying to decide how to transport oil is a logistical challenge. Oil and gas are volatile in nature. Transporting oil and gas from processing facilities or refineries takes special care. There are several ways of transporting oil to consider. Oil transport begins with pipelines. More than a million miles of pipeline globally transport liquid petroleum, either above or below ground. The crude oil is collected from the wellhead and transported by pipeline to processing plants or refineries. As many sources of oil are overseas, the next mode of transport is by ship or barge. Oil supertankers move between refineries around the world. Barges can move the oil on rivers and seas. Another option is to move the oil by railway line. This is an alternative to adding more pipeline from refineries or processing facilities. It is cheaper and quicker typically to set up railway infrastructure than to install more pipelines. Oil and gas is also commonly moved by transport truck. Over-the-road oil transport can move product from remote regions or help to distribute the product shorter distances for industrial and retail use. Fuel tanker trucks are used most often in getting the cargo to gas stations or manufacturing centers. Advantages of transporting oil by truck Tank trailers and trucks can more easily reach places where there is no railway infrastructure or ships and pipelines can rsquo t get to. Transporting oil and allied products by road can also be more efficient. A trailer can be built with compartments allowing for different amounts of various oil products to be transported at once. This can save time and money. Instead of having to take several trips, a delivery can be made in one. nbsp Tank trailers are also affordable to manufacture, which can help to meet surges in demand. So, while trucks don rsquo t offer the storage capacity of the other modes of oil transportation, they do bring flexibility to the mix. Risks of transporting oil by truck Each of the modes of transporting oil has its own drawbacks. For this article, we rsquo ll focus on the risks of transporting oil by truck. nbsp Oil transport truck drivers have a challenging job. They are often operating large, heavy vehicles with a hazardous or flammable cargo. They have to adapt to driving a liquid cargo that shifts in motion. If the liquid oil is in one compartment, it will move in different directions when the vehicle turns or goes or down a hill. This changes the center of mass, which affects the vehicle rsquo s stability. Plus, there rsquo s a big difference between driving a full oil transport truck and an empty one. Additionally, drivers have even more safety precautions and regulations to follow. This is hazardous material hazmat driving , which means a violation can result in steep financial penalties. What safety regulations govern oil transport by truck? Oil transport truck drivers must adhere to regulations set by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association FCSMA . In addition to the rules for any commercial driver, oilfield commercial drivers must also nbsp Have at least one 30-minute off-duty break if driving for more than eight hours. Not drive for more than 11 hours within a timeframe of 14 hours. Not drive for more than 60 hours within seven days. The hours-of-service regulations for commercial drivers also apply. However, there are some exceptions available to oilfield drivers. These include exemptions around the 24-hour restart rule, waiting time, and split breaks. Learn more about the hours-of-service rules for oilfield drivers and how to reduce oil and gas fleet downtime . Common oil transportation problems encountered by trucking fleets Generally, tanker trucks are used to carry small quantities of oil short distances. Truckers also rarely carry crude oil. Still, there are some oil transportation problems that trucking fleets need to consider. nbsp The first, most obvious problem is the volatility of the cargo. Crude oil is also destructive when spilled, as it rsquo s toxic to humans, animals, and the environment. Spillages and accidents must be mitigated. A collision could mean direct contact with the public on a highway or in a densely populated neighborhood. Additionally, inefficiency in fleet management from natural fields to manufacturing facilities can lead to significant quality loss. So, process efficiency and route optimization matter. Yet transportation on land can suffer from uneven roads and poor infrastructure . Then, there are the issues with truck design. Tanker trucks are typically loaded from the bottom to make the journey. But extracting it from the tank at the destination is difficult. Residue oil can stick to the bottom of the truck. Called wetlines, these persistent remnants can contribute to fires or other accidents. All these considerations are part of the reason screening labor is so much more important in oil transport. Even though there rsquo s a driver shortage , the drivers entrusted with taking tanker trucks on the road need to be more experienced and trained to handle the extra challenges of transporting oil. How to transport oil safely with Motive Motive rsquo s fleet management software supports safe oil transportation. Cut the risks associated with transporting oil by truck with the added visibility offered by GPS tracking . Fleet managers can see where trucks are and message drivers to coordinate dispatches and optimize routes. The oil transportation company can also protect its assets with real-time tracking and geofencing features. nbsp By leveraging in-cab dash cams, fleet managers can also keep drivers and their cargo safer. Real-time alerts to drivers help reduce the frequency and severity of accidents. Fleet risk managers can also provide ongoing training with automated, personalized coaching to modify driver behavior. nbsp Prioritize cargo safety and protect drivers while benefitting your bottom line with Motive rsquo s fleet safety solution .

            "Time is money when it comes to outages. When a plant, pipeline, or system is offline, every minute creates ripples downstream. Crucial processes get delayed. Customers grow angrier. The longer a system is down, the greater the effect and the cost. Even a single truck carrying valuable diesel is carefully scheduled to minimize downtime and arrive right on time. A breakdown or waylaid driver can cause expensive delays. nbsp That rsquo s why oil and gas companies and utilities are constantly searching for ways to reduce and shorten delays and outages. nbsp GPS tracking, fault alerts, and real-time ETA notifications can help. When combined into an oil and gas fleet management solution, oil and gas companies can proactively reduce and respond faster to outages and delays. nbsp 1. Identify potential delays and outages faster The best time to avoid a delay or outage is before it begins. Motive rsquo s all-in-one oil and gas fleet management solution helps fleets stay proactive with vehicle and asset health , with configurable reports and alerts that can tell you when service is upcoming or overdue. Real-time fault alerts can catch defects in the moment so you can take action right away to avoid a disruptive breakdown. nbsp Motive also helps fleets stay on top of hours-of-service rules and prepare for roadside inspections, helping avoid costly delays. Motive even incorporates the HOS rules and exemptions specific to hauling oil, helping Trade Star rsquo s fleet stay in compliance. Trade Star rsquo s Senior Operations Manager Kari Gibsays , ldquo Even if my drivers are not 100 familiar with the HOS rules, Motive is. rdquo That keeps drivers and deliveries on schedule. nbsp 2. Improve dispatching and asset tracking to respond faster When an outage occurs, work crews and equipment need to be on site ASAP. Motive rsquo s next-gen integrated GPS tracking technology gives dispatchers valuable information that helps them make smarter decisions, faster. Fleet View shows dispatchers the exact location of every asset, while Proximity Search identifies which drivers are nearest to the outage. With that real-time information, they can dispatch the closest vehicles as quickly as possible. nbsp After dispatch, Motive helps fleets track assets turn by turn to provide updated estimated arrival times. Meanwhile, crews en route can receive all the information they need to address the situation or coordinate with other crews. nbsp If a crew arrives onsite and realizes they need additional manpower or equipment, dispatch can locate and route those resources right away. nbsp Smarter dispatching reduces the time from analysis to action, helping reduce the length of outages, their effects, and their costs. 3. Know when vehicles, equipment, or assets are being used without authorization When a vehicle isn rsquo t where it rsquo s supposed to be, deliveries can be delayed. Outages can drag on. And customers can grow restless and frustrated. nbsp Motive rsquo s equipment and vehicle GPS tracking can send alerts when assets deviate from scheduled routes or geofenced areas. That could identify potential theft or misuse of equipment. Because Motive GPS typically sends updates every one to three seconds that a vehicle is in motion, fleet managers can receive alerts as soon as a potential problem is detected. nbsp 4. Share real-time ETAs with clients Customers want to know when their outage will be resolved or when their delivery will arrive. GPS tracking can enable real-time ETAs that put customers rsquo minds at ease while improving service and satisfaction. nbsp Motive rsquo s live location sharing tool allows dispatchers to share live location and accurate ETAs with customers. Customers can receive real-time alerts throughout the trip to stay in-the-know, without disrupting dispatchers rsquo other duties. nbsp Cordy Environmental shares Motive rsquo s user-friendly dashboard with customers so they can check ETAs at any time. Allen Chatten, Cordy rsquo s Health, Safety, and Environmental Advisor, explains , ldquo I showed the customer how to use geofence and breadcrumbs on all of our trucks, so she could do a query on her own hellip .

            "Many oil and gas fleets rely on aging vehicles that need more maintenance to avoid breakdowns, making it difficult to cut operating costs. One study found that fleets experience a roadside breakdown about every 10,000 miles . Those roadside repairs can cost far more than scheduled maintenance in your own shop. nbsp Yet as the chip shortage drags on, replacing vehicles can be impossible. Instead, fleets are getting more serious about what they can control. And that rsquo s leading many to shift to smarter maintenance that cuts operating costs by reducing downtime . The costs of unplanned downtime Unexpected downtime quickly cuts into profitability. After all, the true bill for a breakdown is more than just parts and labor. And that rsquo s if you can even get the necessary part. Other costs add up quickly and may not always be quantifiable Penalties for missing a delivery or service call Towing charges Dispatching a replacement vehicle that may incur extra fuel costs Shuffling your fleet rsquo s other drivers to cover the idled vehicle rsquo s duties Losing a driver rsquo s productive time Customer satisfaction Breakdowns can be especially expensive for oil and gas fleets in remote areas, as replacement or repair vehicles have to be dispatched from afar. And towing heavy, fuel-filled vehicles isn rsquo t cheap. One estimate found that the average cost to tow a semi-truck is 2,500 . However, towing companies charge up to 75 per mile for a heavy vehicle, so the cost grows quickly with distance. In 2021 the costs of unplanned maintenance grew by 3 . That number is likely higher today as shortages of parts and repair technicians continue. nbsp The best way to avoid these costs is by minimizing unexpected vehicle breakdowns. In this post, you rsquo ll see how Motive can help minimize breakdowns by helping you transition from reactive to predictive maintenance . Cut operating costs by improving vehicle and asset diagnostics Motive rsquo s all-in-one fleet management solution helps keep vehicles on the road with real-time fault code detection and alerts. nbsp When a potential fault is detected, you can act on small issues before they spiral into expensive, disruptive breakdowns. Designate who receives these notifications to ensure a prompt response from the right person on your team. nbsp Repeat fault codes are also flagged, as are irregular fuel consumption trends that can hint at trouble brewing. nbsp Fleet managers can view these alerts, codes, and trends in detailed vehicle utilization reports. Over time, monitoring fuel trends and implementing changes that increase efficiency can save up to 13 of your fuel costs . All these little changes add up. nbsp Learn how oil and gas companies can increase compliance and profits and improve sustainability in these articles. Full fleet-wide vehicle and asset history Track service records across your entire fleet for both vehicles and assets to avoid missing essential maintenance. Motive makes it easy to view which maintenance tasks are upcoming, overdue, or completed. Configure alerts and notifications, and let the automated workflows keep every vehicle on track . Add details like odometer readings, engine hours, and costs so everything is in one place. Then use the maintenance history detail report to track cost per vehicle or maintenance type, helping you spot trends that can inform smarter decisions. For example, if one model tends to have the same issue at a certain mileage, you can adjust your own processes to service other vehicles before they fail. nbsp This detailed history can help you reduce repair costs while extending the lifespan of your vehicles and assets. Custom inspection reports Motive rsquo s customizable vehicle and asset inspection feature lets you adjust parts inspected and change the requirements, instructions, and declarations. Create custom DVIRs to ensure compliance across the fleet, while making it simple for drivers to complete their DVIRs while adding comments and photos. nbsp Streamlining your inspection reports so they mirror your fleet rsquo s workflows, vehicles, and assets helps cut overhead time and administrative hassle. Discover DVIR best practices . Instant insights to drive predictive maintenance Shifting to maintenance based on actual usage rather than the calendar just makes sense. It rsquo s less disruptive to repair things before they break, and it rsquo s less expensive to avoid replacing parts too early. Fleets that shift to preventive maintenance cut operating costs, and reduce maintenance-related downtime days by about 20 . nbsp Motive goes even further. Tracking vehicle and asset health enables predictive maintenance PdM . Predictive maintenance is also known as condition-based maintenance. It uses data science and analytics to forecast when vehicles will need service. nbsp Preventive maintenance is typically triggered by time-sensitive triggers yearly, monthly, etc. or vehicle usage e.g., every 10,000 miles . Maintenance occurs whether the vehicle needs it or not. Sometimes, that means that vehicles are serviced more often than needed. The costs of this ldquo premature upkeep rdquo can add up across a fleet. nbsp Predictive maintenance, such as Motive rsquo s PdM solution, combines sensory devices, the Internet of Things, machine learning, and sophisticated data analysis to constantly assess vehicle condition. The sensors gather information like vibration, temperature, pressure, and noise. With those inputs, Motive can detect early warning signs of defects and potential malfunctions. That can alert a fleet manager of a problem even if the vehicle would otherwise not be scheduled for maintenance. nbsp If you rsquo re trying to reign in your operating costs, take a look at your unplanned downtime.

            "Transit time is a critical metric in shipping The length of transit time will vary depending on route, mode of transport, and other factors Calculate transit time better with route optimization Understanding transit time can help shippers to save money, handle more cargo, and satisfy customers. This article explains the basics of transit time and how route optimization software can reduce transit time in shipping . What is transit time in shipping? Transit time is the amount of time spent moving goods from one point to another. It measures the interval of time between cargo getting picked up from the departure point and arriving to where it is to be delivered. Transit time applies to any mode of transport used to ship goods. Sometimes even a combination. A shipment can be delivered from point A to point B using cargo ship, plane, train, and truck. There are even drones and other options being added to the mix, but they aren rsquo t as common yet. How long is transit time? Transit time can be minutes, hours, days, even weeks, or months. It depends on the mode of transport, the distance traveled, and the route taken. Obviously, a delivery van taking flowers from a shop in the same city as the recipient rsquo s home would have a shorter transit time than a shipment of water-spraying plastic flower boutonni egrave res traveling from a factory in China to a wedding in Boise, Idaho. Distance and mode of transport are big factors. Boat transit times can be weeks or even months if traveling between global destinations. Transit times for rail or over-the-road OTR trucks traveling across the country or a continent may take days or weeks. What factors can affect transit time in shipping? The mode of transport and distance are the two main factors that affect shipping transit times. Many planned and unplanned factors can also play a role, such as Space availability Product requirements Holidays Inclement weather Labor requirements Accidents Poor route planning For a shipment to get from one place to another, there needs to be space available. If there isn rsquo t room in a shipping container or on a vessel, that shipment will have to wait or find another mode of transportation. Product requirements also influence transit times. If you rsquo re transporting ice cream or beer , you may need refrigeration. Hazardous materials also require drivers with experience. Then there are holidays. For example, anyone working with shipments from China should know that their factories close for a month during Chinese New Year. In the United States, the July 4th holiday or another extended weekend could have an impact on shipments, though not as seismic as a month-off. Inclement weather can hold up many modes of transport as well. Foggy conditions or snow can slow down drivers on busy roadways. Or, at the more severe end, a hurricane can close roadways or cause a tunnel to flood. As extreme weather becomes increasingly common, shipping transit times will be impacted more by disruptive weather. Next, the shortage of truck drivers is well publicized. But labor strikes, a shortage of people in warehouses picking and packing, and difficulty filling other roles throughout the supply chain can play a role too. When it comes to driving freight, there are also federal regulations that limit the number of hours a driver can be on the road in the driver rsquo s seat. nbsp Accidents and poor route planning affect transit times as well. A driver could be held up for hours by traffic, or a train could be stopped by a malfunctioning signal. These challenges can be solved with effective route planning. Without the ability to anticipate weather, traffic, and other factors while in transit, the transit time and costs can be increased unexpectedly. How to calculate transit time Many shippers offer expedited shipping services. Same-day delivery has grown increasingly popular among consumers. Plus, shippers can charge more for expedited shipping. But to meet expectations of delivery deadlines, accurately calculating transit time is critical. Expedited or not. To calculate transit time, you need to calculate the distance and speed of the transportation mode. You rsquo ll also need to anticipate the many factors that could impact shipment delivery. For example, you rsquo d factor in a port delay that you knew about in advance. nbsp But how often do you know about such things ahead of time? A bill of lading BOL is a contract between the parties sending and delivering the cargo. It will typically have text warning what types of delays they won rsquo t be liable for covering. So how do you calculate transit time with so many variables? The more information you have, the better. One useful metric is schedule reliability , which measures how consistently carriers are able to achieve their promised transit times. Knowing this can help your business make more accurate predictions regarding your planned transit time. Truckload transit time chart example To gauge transit time, many shippers will make transit time charts available. You might find a chart that lists pickup location, destination, distance traveled, and load availability. A truckload transit time chart example might look like the following Where is the shipment picked up? Where is the shipment going? Approximate mileage traveled Departure days available Los Angeles area Toronto, Ontario 2.520 miles M W F Los Angeles area Miami, Florida 2.700 miles T Th Dallas-Fort Worth area New York area 1.600 miles M-F Dallas-Fort Worth area Toronto, Ontario 1,400 miles T Th Can transit time be guaranteed? Transit time isn rsquo t ever fully guaranteed in shipping. Transit times are impacted by dynamic variables. But the more you know about reliability, routes, weather, traffic, availability, loading and unloading times as well as labor considerations, the better you can build in buffers and calculate transit times. nbsp Along with building in a buffer, shipping companies might improve reliability of transit times by adding availability or increasing the number of drivers. Integrating data from drivers with information about weather, routes, and past trends also helps. Route optimization software makes predicting transit times even easier. How to improve transit times with Motive With more businesses embracing lean methodology to optimize supply chain processes, keeping on top of transit times can be a competitive differentiator for shipping companies. nbsp Transit times play an important role in lead time for businesses . For example, manufacturers need to know when to expect raw goods. Or retailers need to know when to expect goods from the warehouse to offer them to consumers. The shipper that can improve transit times and schedule reliability is rewarded with more loyal customers. Another crucial factor is being able to analyze historical data with predictive models to improve transit times. That rsquo s where Motive rsquo s route optimization software can help. There rsquo s so much data available, it can overwhelming for a human logistics manager to process alone. With an artificial, intelligence-driven platform using the power of machine learning, Motive rsquo s dispatch and workflow solutions provide more reliable transit time estimates. Motive rsquo s software accounts for driver Hours of Service HOS , traffic, weather, and regulations that trucks may need to follow on routes. This might include considering permits or the need for escorts for oversize loads or hazardous materials . The software can also consider driver safety by calculating DRIVE Risk scores. You can make transit time more efficient with GPS tracking too. With live fleet tracking you can monitor congestions and weather and alter routes to avoid delays. All fleet managers need to do is input the various addresses of stops the driver will make and the software uses advanced algorithms to decide the most time-efficient routes to follow.

            "Fuel is one of the main costs for transportation fleets, with an estimated 40 of annual fleet operations costs coming from fuel expenses. 1 Continuous increases in the cost of fuel highlight a greater need for fuel efficiency. Fuel prices have risen significantly in the last few months, reaching a high in U.S. history this year, with diesel currently averaging 5.49 per gallon. 2 But fuel prices matter all the time, not just when prices are high. 91.5 of for-hire carriers are small businesses that operate 6 or fewer trucks 3 where every dollar counts. A fleet management telematics platform can provide specific insights about your fuel consumption and identify ways to improve efficiency. Read Fleet card basics and benefits . New study shows promising results Motive has published a study showing that businesses can improve fuel efficiency and optimize vehicle maintenance by using data insights and AI-powered automation. In the study, Motive analyzed over 800 commercial fleets across a two-year period beginning in January 2020, identified what top fleets with the best fuel performance increase did to improve their fuel efficiency, and measured their impact. Key findings Top-performing fleets used the Motive Automated Operations Platform insights to reduce fuel consumption by 13 . Using fuel performance data and identifying coaching opportunities, these fleets achieved savings by improving driving behaviors, averaging 79 reduction in hard acceleration, 40 reduction in hard braking, and 20 reduction in idling time. The top fleets also had an increased focus on maintenance, with 80 more inspections compared to other fleets. Motive enabled the top-performing fleets in the sample to save an estimated 3 million gallons of fuel in 2021 alone. This is equivalent to 31,000 tons of CO2 that were not released into the atmosphere. Motive fleets paid an average price of 3.29 per gallon of fuel during this time, which led to estimated savings of 9.9 million in 2021. Given the much higher fuel prices in 2022, these savings are even more impactful.

            "Rising fuel prices and shortages are causing many fleet owners to consider renewable diesel and other alternative fuels. Compressed natural gas CNG and liquid petroleum gas LPG have been viable options but require retrofitting. And they rsquo re derived from fossil fuels. nbsp With the cost of fossil fuels, supply chain disruptions, and the emergence of sustainability goals , researchers have been working to generate higher volumes of clean, renewable fuel. Creating a viable alternative fuel To be considered a viable fuel replacement, renewable diesel and other alternative fuels must meet certain criteria. This includes Having a large resource base and high energy density Production that limits the use of fossil energy Using renewable, natural resources with low carbon emissions According to DieselNet, standard specifications for alternative fuels must be developed and adopted before they rsquo re considered a viable fuel replacement and can be produced on a larger scale. This includes the impact of the alternative fuel on Engine performance and emissions Engine materials nbsp Handling and safety Renewable diesel and polyfuel meet this criteria. What is renewable diesel? According to the U.S. Department of Energy, ldquo Renewable diesel is a biomass-derived transportation fuel suitable for use in diesel engines. It meets the ASTM D975 specification for petroleum in the United States hellip and is approved for blending with petroleum diesel. rdquo Jim Nebergall of Cummins Inc., states, ldquo Renewable diesel can be used as drop-in replacements. For most engines, no modification is required. rdquo Benefits of renewable diesel Compatible with existing diesel engines Can be distributed through current infrastructure. Can be produced in the U.S. from a variety of biomass sources. Several plants currently make renewable diesel in the U.S., and they have the combined ability to produce more than 590 million gallons per year. The downside is that most renewable diesel is consumed in California and Oregon, so it may be difficult to find beyond these two states. nbsp It wouldn rsquo t take much, however, to increase the yield, according to Carrie Song, North American Vice President for renewable road transport at Neste. ldquo The effort that will be associated with the change from the petroleum diesel to the renewable diesel can be overnighted, because the infrastructure is already there. There rsquo s really no need for investments into additional infrastructure. We can just leverage the current available assets. rdquo What is polyfuel? Polyfuel is an oil that rsquo s made from several types of recyclable plastics. It rsquo s a clean, light-colored fuel that can be used in most diesel engines. nbsp According to Power Technology, ldquo Plastic-derived fuels are also capable of producing a cleaner burning fuel than traditional sources due to their low sulfur content, considering the majority of developing nations use sulfur-heavy diesel. rdquo nbsp There rsquo s also an abundance of plastic. The EPA estimates that only 8.7 of plastics are recycled each year mdash about 3,100 tons. That rsquo s a small percentage of the 35,680 tons of plastic generated each year , according to available data. The majority of plastic currently ends up in landfills. PolyFuel, a manufacturer of crude oil from plastic waste, explains, ldquo Using unwanted plastic as a raw material is a brilliant way to service the environment and make a profit. The PolyFuel process is an economically viable, long-term solution for the environment and for society rsquo s energy needs. Our venture is also directly aligned with the ldquo zero-landfill rdquo initiatives that are being adopted across the country. rdquo Benefits of Polyfuel Coverts plastic waste into clean, usable diesel fuel Reduces dependence on fossil fuels Environmentally friendly and efficient production process A report by Grand View Research estimates that the plastic-to-fuel market ldquo is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 29.5 from 2021 to 2028. rdquo The downside is that polyfuel isn rsquo t readily available in most states at this time. nbsp Other alternative fuels There are several other alternative and renewable diesel fuels. Biodiesel is easily derived from used vegetable oils and animal fats, but it requires a significant amount of oil and there are mixed reviews on how it affects a vehicle rsquo s engine. nbsp Renewable natural gas RNG is ldquo where waste from agriculture, landfills, and wastewater treatment plants is transformed into some of the cleanest fuel available ndash proven through unprecedented carbon intensity scores, rdquo according to U.S. Gain. nbsp Hydrogen is an emerging fuel solution and availability is limited. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy states, ldquo Hydrogen is a clean fuel that, when consumed in a fuel cell, produces only water. Hydrogen can be produced from a variety of domestic resources, such as natural gas, nuclear power, biomass, and renewable power like solar and wind. These qualities make it an attractive fuel option for transportation hellip . rdquo Save on fuel and increase vehicle run time nbsp Whichever fuel option you choose for your fleet, it rsquo s important to monitor and reduce fuel consumption so you can maximize operational efficiency. nbsp Motive rsquo s automated operation platform can help you save on fuel and increase vehicle runtime. Increase visibility View all your operational data in a single platform for full visibility across physical operations mdash and see your fleet rsquo s fuel consumption and trends, benchmarked across our entire network. nbsp Improve fuel economy Pinpoint fuel-wasting vehicles and driver behavior.

            "As soaring oil prices impact the profitability of transportation fleets around the globe, trucking and construction businesses are trying to improve efficiency any way they can. Fuel costs are among a fleet rsquo s most substantial line items, right up there with labor, equipment, and maintenance. In construction, where fuel is a critical component of the building process, firms have felt the impact of rising prices as much as anyone. In this article, we look at what rsquo s driving the fuel crisis and how Motive can help you improve fleet profitability right now. A perfect storm of factors has caused oil prices to skyrocket In July, domestic crude oil prices stood at 99 a barrel, trending downward by about 8 . It rsquo s the first time U.S. oil prices have dropped below 100 a barrel since May. While that may sound like welcome news for fleets that have worked hard to cut expenses and waste, some fear it rsquo s a sign of a looming recession . nbsp According to the New York Times, trends in crude oil prices are the biggest driver of soaring fuel costs. Estimates from the Energy Information Administration show that in May, the cost of crude oil accounted for 47 of the price of a gallon of diesel fuel. While the United States is the world rsquo s largest producer of oil and processed petroleum products, we rsquo re exporting more than 1 million gallons of diesel a day to Latin America and Europe as a result of the Ukraine war, Transport Topics reports . nbsp Since the start of the war, Russia, the world rsquo s second-largest oil producer, has exported less oil in response to U.S. and E.U. sanctions. The cut in international supply has pushed fuel prices higher, and oil-rich nations in the Middle East can rsquo t produce supply fast enough. nbsp In the United States, at least 13 oil refineries have shut down on the East and West Coasts or have cut production since the start of the pandemic, hindering capacity to refine oil into diesel and gasoline. Meanwhile, domestic oil producers with an eye toward an electric future hesitate to ramp up production for fear of losing financially in the long run. Lower fuel costs with the help of technology Fortunately, there are a few steps fleet managers can take right away to reduce emissions and stay profitable. Learn about tools and get tips to stay ahead of the game in Motive rsquo s upcoming webinar, Cutting fuel costs with the help of technology.

These terms Help ensure a smooth export transaction. Avoid potentially costly mistakes. Clarify tasks, costs, and risks for nbsp buyers and sellers. There are 11 widely used Incoterms. Delivered at Place DAP is one of the seven rules for any mode of transport. Another four are specific to sea and inland waterway transport. The DAP Incoterm is generally incorporated into a sale contract. It means that the seller will deliver the goods to a named destination the ldquo at place rdquo at the disposal of the buyer, ready for unloading. How does DAP work? For DAP to work, the buyer and seller must agree on a precise unloading spot at the named place of destination. nbsp Under DAP terms for freight shipping, the seller is typically responsible for loading, delivery to port, and export customs as well as unloading and loading at port of export. The buyer also addresses transit to destination, unloading at port of import, loading truck at port of import, and carriage to destination. The buyer is responsible only for import customs clearance and import duties. Note, DAP and other Incoterms, do not Cover all the conditions of a sale. nbsp nbsp Identify the goods sold. List the contract price or payment terms negotiated between seller and buyer. Specify which documents must be nbsp provided to the buyer to facilitate customs clearance. Address liability, delayed delivery, or nbsp dispute resolution mechanisms. What industries use delivered at place? DAP is most often used with containerized freight. It rsquo s also a convenient arrangement for those in e-commerce or dealing with high-value, high-tech goods. A difficulty is that the seller is responsible for more, when the buyer could be better positioned to take on the transport tasks in the destination country. DAP Incoterms example The International Chamber of Commerce ICC first introduced DAP as an Incoterm in 2010, replacing Delivery Duty Unpaid. To further understand DAP , consider this example. A buyer in Halifax agrees to purchase chemical products from a seller in Sweden. They enter into a DAP deal, which means the Swedish seller will pay to transport the goods from their storage to the port and from the port to a destination in Halifax. When the goods arrive in Halifax, the buyer continues to pay until the cargo is delivered at place. The seller is responsible for notifying the buyer the product has arrived. If the port in Halifax is the terminal destination, the buyer will pay for customs duty, import tariffs, and other local taxes and any freight to get those products to their factories. However, if the terminal destination in the DAP agreement is the buyer rsquo s factory, the seller must pay for the freight to that place as well. Typical DAP shipping costs With global freight transported under DAP, the sellers take on all costs related to the delivery of the goods to the final destination. This is true whether it rsquo s sea or air freight or ground transport. International shipping incurs several costs. These include obtaining export licenses and related permits, production and procurement costs, packaging, and freight charges. Who is responsible for DAP insurance? The cargo insurance under DAP is negotiable. That means it can be covered by either the buyer or the seller. That will be negotiated upfront when dealing with global freight. DAP Delivered at Place advantages and disadvantages A big advantage of DAP is that it clearly outlines buyer and seller responsibilities. If there are any unexpected costs during International shipping, the DAP Incoterm will already have established who is responsible. DAP is a low liability agreement for the buyer. Plus, having the seller take on the bulk of the fees and responsibility can help buyers with cash flow and inventory management. DAP can sound straightforward. However, there are some things that could go wrong Customs clearance could delay delivery causing extra storage, demurrage, and detention costs. Goods could arrive at the destination country without complete proper documentation. Buyer could delay paying duties and taxes required for shipper to get goods to the agreed upon destination. Top tips to avoid misunderstandings in DAP To avoid misunderstandings with a DAP shipment. It rsquo s best to first agree to a delivery timeframe and the point of destination. Clearly state both precisely in the contract of sale. Agree beforehand who will pay for unloading charges, cover DAP insurance, and pay for any demurrage, detention, or storage fees if there is a customs slowdown. nbsp Sellers can also simplify DAP agreements by providing necessary documentation a few days before shipment arrival. Notifying the buyer when to expect the goods rsquo arrival keeps things running smoother. Route optimization software can help with providing advance notice. How Motive can assist with your DAP shipment Under the terms of a DAP shipment, the buyer and seller agree on a precise unloading spot at the named place. Communication between the two parties about when to expect the delivery is important too. Motive can help smooth the DAP shipment arrangement with route optimization technology for delivery fleets .

            "Enterprise logistics requires constant juggling. You have to track assets, manage multiple modes of transportation, and monitor deliveries. All while communicating with carriers and customers. Carrier management systems can help transportation services manage, monitor, and analyze relevant information to power productivity and profitability. What is carrier management? Carrier management is the process of managing different carriers, also referred to as third-party logistics, to support business transport. It helps transporters make data-informed decisions about the carriers to select for different shipping requirements. nbsp Transportation supply chain success requires companies to weigh many factors in making decisions about efficient and effective delivery. Carrier management allows the business to rely on accurate information and easily adapt to challenges that arise. nbsp Why is carrier management in transportation important? Enterprises can execute deliveries more reliably and profitably. A carrier management software solution can track key performance indicators to drive decisions about what partners to work with and when. KPI reporting for these purposes might include nbsp Carrier performance Shipping delays Delivery costs Driver professionalism Carrier compliance Advantages and disadvantages of carrier management systems Carrier management systems can provide a streamlined view of the many moving parts in transportation logistics. They also helps freight brokers keep track of fuel surcharges, deliveries, and more. There are some challenges to be wary of, though. Benefits In carrier management, be sure to partner with a carrier that will get the load to its destination on time, undamaged, and affordably. With the data insights you gain from carrier management systems, you can monitor who rsquo s providing quality service. This lets you assign more loads to carriers you trust. You can also earn more business from shippers who rely on you to get the job done right. nbsp Carrier management systems make it easier to source specific carriers to meet the particular requests of an order. You can also save time on vetting carriers if your system already has compliance records. Those records are likely complete with licensing and insurance requirements, delivery reliability, and other factors. Instead of having to rely on paperwork and phone calls, you can do a quick search online of the system data. Rate negotiation can be managed more efficiently as well, because you rsquo ll have access to accurate industry rates and previous agreements with those carriers. nbsp Challenges There are an estimated 15.5 million trucks operating in the United States annually, and more than 3.5 million truck drivers. nbsp These trucks are responsible for generating a revenue of about 255.5 billion per year. A shortage of about 80,000 truck drivers in the industry, according to the American Trucking Associations, can make carrier management more difficult. Driver retention is critical . Staying compliant with ever-changing regulations can be a challenge, but tools such as electronic logging devices can help fleets stay compliant from anywhere. Fuel expenses and vehicle maintenance can make carrier management costly. Track idling time to better reduce fuel waste . With vehicle diagnostics linked with fleet management, proactive maintenance is possible. It can also help increase revenues and minimize operating costs. nbsp Find out how to secure the best loads from our discussion with seasoned owner-operator Chad Boblett. Features to expect from carrier management software Transportation enterprises and freight brokers use carrier management to manage the carriers helping shippers move goods from point A to point B efficiently and in a cost-effective manner. A carrier management software that includes contract and rate management, claims management, and carrier scorecards can help the business be more productive and profitable. nbsp Many carrier management software includes invoice processing and payment automation to save you time. A software that also audits freight bills can be useful as well. You can configure the software to compare actual billing against the signed agreement covering fuel and delivery costs and more. The system can flag any discrepancies. You might also be able to integrate carrier and consumer feedback to measure performance factors. This will help you choose the best carrier for your future projects. GPS tracking will provide real-time updates on delivery status. This can be useful in analyzing delays and providing proactive communication to your customers or the consumer.

            "Remember when diesel prices dipped to just 2.55 a gallon in 2020 ? Since then, prices have more than doubled to 40-year highs . No one is safe from high prices, not even the oil and gas companies that supply fuel to commercial fleets. nbsp Meanwhile, constantly fluctuating fuel prices make it tough to accurately project the full hit to your bottom line. nbsp While you can rsquo t predict fuel prices, a fleet management solution can help you take proactive steps to use less fuel . These actions can ease some of the financial burden while improving overall efficiency. nbsp Limit fuel consumption by cutting idling and wear and tear Telematics data can give you the information you need to start making changes that can reduce excess fuel consumption and costly wear and tear. nbsp Many fleets find that reducing idling is a great start. After all, an idling vehicle can burn 0.8 gallons of fuel per hour . Since the average heavy-duty truck idles about 1,800 hours each year , those costs add up. Especially now. Telematics data can track how much time each driver spends idling, then calculate the amount of wasted fuel. Some fleets use this information as part of their fleet management to create incentive programs that reward drivers who reduce their idle time. nbsp nbsp You can also use data to optimize how you use your vehicles. For example, better route optimization can avoid traffic congestion or reduce overall trips and mileage. nbsp Dispatchers can use Motive rsquo s Fleet View to quickly identify all available vehicles, drivers, and assets near a location, with estimated travel time and distance. Better yet, dispatchers can also see each driver rsquo s hours of service HOS details to ensure that the trip can be completed compliantly. nbsp As Kari Gib, Senior Operations Manager for Utah rsquo s Trade Star LLC discovered , Motive also incorporates the HOS rules and exemptions specific to fleets hauling oil. ldquo Even if my drivers are not 100 familiar with the HOS rules, Motive is, rdquo she says. nbsp Overall, more efficient dispatch and routing leads to less waiting, lower fuel consumption , reduced wear and tear, and fewer compliance issues. nbsp nbsp Optimize fuel usage with more efficient driving The Fuel Hub, part of Motive s fleet management solution, measures your fleet rsquo s fuel consumption and identifies your top- and under-performing drivers and vehicles. With that information, you can coach your drivers to build better fuel consumption habits. nbsp For example, the U.S. Department of Energy finds that driving more efficiently can improve fuel economy by 30 at highway speeds and up to 40 in traffic. That rsquo s because speeding and hard acceleration use more fuel than more measured driving. In fact, speeding can increase fuel use by 5 to 28 . nbsp However, many drivers aren rsquo t even aware that they rsquo ve developed bad habits. Once you point them out, you can work with your drivers to slow down, accelerate more gently, or avoid close following. Beyond fuel consumption, these changes can also improve safety. nbsp Usher Transport, a Kentucky-based hauler, reduced accidents by 32 after switching to Motive . Beau Mosley, EVP of Safety and HR at Usher Transport, explains, ldquo Motive empowers us to objectively identify risk and change behavior on the front end, rather than the back end. rdquo Benchmark performance to identify areas ripe for improvement It can be hard to know how your fleet stacks up in terms of fuel consumption and efficiency. Are you already doing well, or do you have room for improvement? Which changes will make a difference? That rsquo s where a fleet management solution like Motive can help. When you compare your fuel usage against the averages reported by fleets using Motive, you can gauge which improvements might have the biggest impact. Motive Fuel Hub gives you a consolidated view of your fleet rsquo s fuel trends, benchmarked across our entire network of vehicles. Increased visibility can tell you where every gallon of fuel is going and how you stack up against the average. Motive Fuel Hub also helps you identify which drivers are your top performers and which ones need coaching. That knowledge has helped Motive customers save up to 13 on fuel by reducing idling and harsh driving behaviors. nbsp When we spent two years studying how 820 fleets used Fuel Hub , the top-performing fleets reduced idling time by 20 and cut hard accelerations by 79 . nbsp Since you can rsquo t control fuel costs, strive to make changes that can improve your fleet rsquo s fuel efficiency. When you choose the Motive fleet management solution , you can save fuel while cultivating a safer, more efficient fleet that improves your bottom line in unexpected ways. Get in touch to start improving your own fleet rsquo s efficiency .\n",

            "For supply chains to continue to run smoothly, every link must connect cohesively and effectively. An essential component to ensuring supply chains are operating as intended is a transportation management system TMS . TMS is a subset of supply chain management and is a software category that helps in planning and executing the physical movement of goods. All participants in the supply chain can use a TMS, from manufacturers to distributors, to third-party logistics providers 3PLs ndash virtually any party that wants to move goods. A TMS can be beneficial for all supply chains , from simple to complex. This guide covers all aspects of TMS, including key benefits, who uses transportation management software, and important features to look for in TMS. nbsp Table of Contents What is a transportation management system? What is the difference between a TMS and a WMS? Who uses transport management software? What are the benefits of transport management systems? What KPIs should you track with a TMS? Features to look for in transport management software Why use Motive as your transport management solution? What is a transportation management system? A transportation management system is a logistics software solution designed to streamline the shipping process. The core function is to enable the user to find the best mode and rate for any type of shipment to ensure they are getting the best deal. nbsp Core features for any modern TMS include rating, booking, and tracking are considered What is the difference between a TMS and a WMS? In TMS logistics, it rsquo s important to consider the connection between the TMS and the warehouse management system WMS . A WMS helps manage warehouse functions, including palletization, order fulfillment, shipping and receiving, and inventory tracking. Originally, TMS and WMS were designed separately. One is meant to control and facilitate the oversight of your storage facilities WMS , and the other is meant to handle your fleet and all elements connected to it TMS . By integrating your WMS and TMS, you gain more effective data sharing between the two platforms, which allows for clear and defined information about manufacturing, warehouse processes, and, of course, transportation or distribution. With a TMS and a WMS, you can better plan the movement of goods across your supply chain, not just within the confines of your warehouse. Who uses transport management software? According to SAP , any business that ships and receives goods has a use for transport management software. The number of TMS users skyrocketed during the pandemic, with many new ecommerce companies joining those in the supply chain industry looking for innovative ways to deliver goods quickly and in a cost-efficient manner. Specific businesses that rely on a TMS include but are not limited to nbsp Pharmaceutical and healthcare nbsp Retail nbsp Manufacturing nbsp nbsp Food service nbsp nbsp Automotive Logistics nbsp Aerospace, government, and defense nbsp What are the benefits of transport management systems? There are many valuable, tangible benefits to using transportation management systems. Some of these benefits are New delivery capabilities Inventory Reductions nbsp Increased customer satisfaction Improved warehouse efficiency and productivity Motive rsquo s software integrates with most leading TMS. One benefit of integrating Motive with your TMS is Motive rsquo s Driver Workflow which provides real-time communication with TMS dispatch modules . By simplifying the dispatch process, dispatchers can use the McLeod TMS to send forms and load instructions directly to the Motive Driver App. Drivers can complete all their loads from within the Motive app, a much simpler process than using multiple systems for completing dispatches and logging Hours-of-Service information. nbsp What KPIs should you track with aTMS? Business-critical KPIs can be tracked within a TMS, like Claims versus freight costs To evaluate claims versus freight costs, divide total loss in freight claims by the overall freight cost. A higher number for this KPI could mean there is an issue with operations, while a lower number favors continuing existing operations as they are. Freight cost compared to total sales By dividing outbound and inbound freight costs separately by net sales, you can isolate the costs associated with each individually. Transportation time Measure transit time as a view of the expected shipping time compared to the actual delivery time for each shipment. nbsp Percent trucking capacity use Finding capacity availability is done by dividing the shipment weight by available shipping capacity. nbsp On-time pickup and delivery Trucking companies must work to ensure delivery time is as accurate as possible. Knowing when packages leave and arrive allows recipients to make appropriate plans to receive the package without risk of theft. nbsp Fuel efficiency Federal agencies mandate reporting and compliance to environmental initiatives for fewer emissions and fuel use. Failure to track fuel efficiency could result in penalties as well as increased fuel costs. Maintenance costs This transportation management KPI measures a wide array of maintenance costs. Preventative maintenance, outsourced maintenance costs versus in-house costs, and fleet aesthetics painting, washing and changing of URS identifiers should be tracked. nbsp Features to look for in transport management software There are many transportation management solutions available. Here are six key features to consider must-haves when looking for transport management software. Carrier contract management nbsp Real-time tracking Integration with leading ERP, WMS, or OMS systems Reports and business intelligence nbsp Finding the best mode and rate of transportation Rating, booking, and tracking A TMS can analyze your shipping operations and help you take action based on that analysis.

            "Fuel is an ongoing expense that fluctuates depending on the market. The market appears to be on an upswing, with the average gasoline price peaking at over five dollars a gallon in summer 2022. If the current fuel trends are any indication, demand for fossil fuels will continue to increase in the rest of 2022 and beyond. With the predictions of rising fuel prices, using a fleet fuel card is an excellent way to maximize your fuel savings , as many fleet fuel cards offer rewards that can impact your bottom line. nbsp Fleet fuel cards also known as fleet gas cards allow you to track purchases and employee spending , view detailed reports, manage maintenance expenses, and take full control of spending for your business vehicles. What is a fuel card? The idea behind a fuel card is simple. They provide a way for your business to manage fuel and maintenance expenses effectively and efficiently while offering added security and tracking features to help with fleet management. Fleet fuel cards are much safer than cash and provide one online account where you can easily review all transactions, access miles-per-gallon tracking information, and halt unauthorized spending. nbsp How to get a fuel card for your fleet If you rsquo re wondering how to get a fleet fuel card to use, it isn t as difficult as you d think. In fact, it can all be done online. The process is fairly straightforward. Once you rsquo ve decided on the right gas card provider, the next step is to start contacting the fuel card companies that you think will work best for your fleet. nbsp The majority of companies require filling out some basic information, like details about yourself, your business, your fleet s vehicles, your business rsquo s requirements, and some contact information. Most fleet card companies operate quickly and thoroughly and help you throughout the sales process. How do fleet fuel cards work? Fleet fuel cards are a huge benefit for companies and individual drivers who want to track their fuel expenses closely. Fleet fuel cards are designed to record specific information about fuel usage, like driver ID information and mileage. The information that fleet fuel cards give you helps you track who rsquo s making fuel purchases and how many miles per gallon of fuel you rsquo re getting. nbsp Some carriers use generic business cards for fuel usage, but traditional business cards have some downsides and will only provide information like date, location, and dollar amount of fuel transactions. What are the benefits of fleet fuel cards? Better fuel efficiency Among fleet fuel card benefits are better fuel efficiency. While there are many tips drivers can try to save money on fuel , fleet cards help you take a data-focused approach. Fuel cards capture more robust data at most brand-name fuel stations, including information like price per gallon, location, driver ID, and odometer readings. Access to this data gives drivers and companies a more accurate picture of fuel purchases they are making, allowing them to analyze fuel spend and find areas to optimize. nbsp Fraud protection Fuel cards are configured for drivers to enter a unique ID for their transactions, and this prevents unauthorized users from using a particular fuel card. There are also fuel cards that allow companies to set purchase limits as well as alerts for when those limits are exceeded by users. When searching for a fuel card, it rsquo s a good idea to make sure that it comes with security features , like the ability to limit access or get reimbursement for lost or stolen cards and unauthorized use. Streamlined operations A huge fleet fuel card benefit for companies is the ability to streamline some of their operations. Fleet fuel cards come with many controls and parameters companies can set for card usage. nbsp Some controls and parameters companies can set with fleet fuel cards are Allow at-pump purchases only Allow both at-pump and in-store purchases Limit purchases to only certain locations Set different purchasing profiles for different types of vehicles with different fuel capacities Allow the ability to override purchase limits if there is an emergency Help with IFTA Reporting Unless you are exempt from IFTA fuel tax , your business operations also include International Fuel Tax Agreement IFTA reporting . Per the IFTA, a comprehensive fuel tax report is required four times a year. nbsp The IFTA agreement states that commercial carriers must keep precise records of fuel purchases, mileage, and fuel taxes accrued in each state or province traveled in. The records that fleet fuel cards provide help in compiling this necessary information for IFTA reports. nbsp Cost savings Most fleet fuel cards have an online platform that allows users access to detailed purchase information. Having access to purchase information in a single, centralized location allows users to optimize spending for the most savings.

            "Recently, consumer preferences shifted dramatically from shopping at local brick-and-mortar retailers to online with on-demand delivery. With this shift in consumer behavior, the demand for reefer trailers and cold chain management has also increased to keep pace with market demand for temperature-sensitive products. The companies that transport temperature-sensitive products must adhere to precise temperature controls to ensure product quality and Food Safety Modernization Act FSMA compliance. The new Motive and Thermo King integration automates reefer management, allowing customers to get full visibility and stay compliant while eliminating errors and reducing operating costs. nbsp Understanding cold chain management Cold chain management is the process of shipping, storing, and displaying temperature-sensitive goods for various industries, including food and beverage, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals. nbsp Temperature-sensitive products rely on cold chain management for product safety, and adherence to regulatory requirements, like the Food Safety Modernization Act FSMA . Cold chain management is an essential component of the supply chain to maintain temperature ranges and air quality, including carbon dioxide, humidity, and oxygen levels. Any disruption or failure within the management process or during cold chain transportation, including processing, storage, and display may cause product spoilage, loss, and financial implications. So maintaining the correct temperature and product environment is critical for everyone involved, from the manufacturer to the shipper and the customer. Trailer temperature monitoring is essential to ensure quality goods, on-time deliveries, and food safety. Yet, manually managing refrigerated trailers slows down productivity and increases the risk of operator error and spoilage. Centralized reefer monitoring and a remote reefer monitoring system are essential to staying compliant and reducing mistakes. Motive and Thermo King partner for complete cold chain visibility and control The Thermo King integration decreases programming errors and reduces operations costs by displaying Thermo King refrigeration data, including temperature modes, reefer temperature logs, and alerts in the Fleet Dashboard. The integration requires the new Thermo King cable that connects the Thermo King unit with a Motive Asset Gateway, which handles the connectivity into the cloud. By connecting their reefer units to the Motive Automated Operations Platform, fleet managers can now conduct reefer temperature monitoring directly on the Fleet Dashboard along with the other fleet telematics. They can dive into historical temperature and telematics data and set alerts for when temperature conditions fall out of a specified range during cold chain transportation. nbsp Not only can fleet managers monitor their reefer units, they can also control them directly from the Fleet Dashboard. With this remote reefer monitoring system, fleet managers can set the temperature, eliminating the need for the driver to wake up to start the pre-cooling process hours before departure. nbsp Finally, to produce a reefer temperature log for their customer or an FSMA audit, fleet managers no longer have to take the reefer to a dealer, removing the trailer from active use. Instead, they can produce the reefer temperature log right in the Fleet View. Real risk prevention For our partners who participated in our product testing program, having real-time and accurate reefer temperature telematics was a game changer for their day-to-day operations. The remote reefer monitoring system changed how a reefer was pre-cooled. Reefer tracking and telematics helped them decide which reefer needed maintenance. When a load was on the road, drivers and managers could actively monitor reefer temperatures and status by viewing them on the Fleet Dashboard or set up automatic notifications to be sent when a reefer is outside the desired temperature range. These features helped companies better understand their risk and actively manage their reefers for higher efficiency and lower load spoilage. Get started nbsp Motive Reefer Monitoring is available now for customers equipped with Motive Asset Gateways in their Thermo King reefers.

            "If you rsquo re asked, ldquo What is lead time in shipping? rdquo would you be able to respond confidently? Would you also be able to concisely explain how it rsquo s different from delivery time? Or explain the importance of lead time in shipping? nbsp This article provides answers to key questions about lead time in shipping and shares strategies to improve it. nbsp What does lead time mean in shipping? Lead time in shipping is the time gap between when an order is placed and when it arrives at its final destination. Take a teenager buying a pair of sneakers online. Once those shoes are paid for, the order is submitted for someone to pick and package. Once the order rsquo s fulfilled, it rsquo s collected by a shipper from the primary supplier for delivery to the recipient. All of these actions are involved in shipping lead time. There are also other types of lead time . Cumulatively, you may need to also account for Material lead time nbsp How long it takes to order the supplies and receive them Production or manufacturing lead time nbsp The time a company takes to produce and deliver the products Cumulative lead time can be impacted by production process times, supply chain availability, and inventory management practices. Lead time will be much longer if the manufacturer needs to order raw materials to produce the product. If that rsquo s the case, you rsquo ll need to wait for those materials to arrive for product manufacture. Is lead time the same as delivery time? Lead time is different from delivery time. Shipping lead time includes the time spent processing and handling the goods as well as the time spent on delivery. Delivery time, however, only accounts for the time from cargo collection by the shipper and delivery to the recipient. nbsp Keep in mind, customers only care how long they have to wait for the order to arrive. Why is lead time important in shipping? Customers want their deliveries to arrive promptly. Poor shipping experiences can lead to customer attrition, one reason that lead time is so important in shipping. Longer lead times can also create inefficiency and excessive inventories, which inflate costs. Understanding shipping lead times helps workers set realistic delivery dates and meet customer expectations. nbsp How to calculate lead time in shipping To calculate lead time in shipping, you need to know the amount of time it takes to fulfill a customer order after the order is placed. Transportation lead time will vary depending on inventory management practices. nbsp Take a made-to-order T-shirt company, for example. Once someone orders their shirts, it could take a day to get the shirts from the warehouse and another day to prepare the design. Printing and packaging the shirts takes another four days. That rsquo s a four-day shipping lead time. What factors can affect lead time in shipping? Shipping lead times can be impacted by material shortages, labor shortfalls, or shipping delays. If the T-shirt company above doesn rsquo t have the right red shirts in stock, they can rsquo t move on to design and printing. Or, if there aren rsquo t enough people working in the factory or in the warehouse picking and packing, lead time can grow longer. Shipping delays at any point can also cause lead time variability . Strategies to help reduce your shipping lead time Knowing customers want fast delivery, you need to look for ways to reduce your shipping lead times. The following strategies can help. Optimize inventory management Following lean business management principles and using nbsp just-in-time inventory management can shorten material and factory lead times. nbsp With a full understanding of lead time you can better set your reorder levels to avoid stockouts or having to worry about lost sales from back orders. Streamline internal processes Unwieldy processes to fulfill a customer order can make lead times lag unnecessarily. Outsourcing pre-production can help reduce shipping lead time. Automating fulfillment or inventory processes such as stock-taking or tracking purchase orders may help as well. Partner with reliable shippers A manufacturer or e-commerce retailer may be doing everything in their power to optimize lead time, but it can all be for naught if the shippers are slowing things down. Monitoring delivery success rates for different shipping partners can help ensure that you partner with the ones that get your goods where they need to be at the right time. You might consider adding lead time-related stipulations to your contracts with shippers. This might include specifying delivery times, penalties for shipping delays, or advance notice of price changes. nbsp Try dropshipping Dropshipping takes out the middleman. In this model, the retailer doesn rsquo t stock their own inventory. Instead, they rely on the supplier to directly ship the product to customers. The dropshipping business handles the inventory and fulfillment logistics. How Motive can help improve your shipping lead times Motive can help decrease lead times by speeding up the physical delivery of the goods and streamlining last-mile delivery . Route optimization is central to Motive s delivery fleet management solution . Using traffic and location data as well as GPS tracking, Motive can efficiently plan delivery routes that are both time- and cost-efficient. With live updates, fleet managers can also save time and money by rerouting drivers or avoiding congestion or weather hazards. Avoid last-minute delivery problems as well with access to the data you need about everything from fuel costs to warehousing, idling, and downtime. You can expedite last-mile delivery and improve profits with Motive rsquo s comprehensive fleet workflow solution helping to reduce fuel usage, minimize vehicle breakdowns, control overhead, and prevent collisions. The data you get from Motive rsquo s AI-driven platform can help your lead time analysis. Being able to easily see how long it takes for products to be prepared and shipped can mean faster fulfillment rates, which lead to greater customer satisfaction. Find out more today.\n",

            "Keeping your projects on schedule and on budget isn rsquo t an easy proposition when you have limited visibility into your equipment and asset use. You may also be dealing with other time-consuming and costly distractions such as equipment thefts or spending too much time manually tracking maintenance schedules. nbsp Why is construction fleet management important? A construction fleet management solution helps you keep track of equipment and assets across multiple sites and yards. It can also improve the safety of your drivers and equipment operators. When you manually track construction equipment or log maintenance schedules, it rsquo s often prone to human error and requires more hours from fleet management. Maintenance can be overlooked and it rsquo s easier for equipment to be misused. nbsp With the right construction fleet management solution, you rsquo re better able to complete jobs on time and on budget. Keep your construction projects on time and on budget with Motive. What are the benefits of construction fleet management software? In this guide, we rsquo ll explain the benefits of construction fleet management software and how one equipment management platform can provide the real-time insights you need to nbsp Know at-a-glance where your drivers, assets, materials, and equipment are nbsp Connect vehicles, drivers, and the office so everyone can access critical information Optimize the use of your vehicles and assets to limit wear and tear We rsquo ll do this by sharing the journey of KeepBuilding in a fictional use case. To show a complete fleet management transformation in action, we rsquo ll say that KeepBuilding is a fast-growing general contractor in Atlanta. You may identify with them. In the last year, they rsquo ve nearly doubled its number of job sites, employees, and contractors. They rsquo ve also increased their general workload. With this kind of growth comes growing pains. For KeepBuilding these pains manifested in several ways nbsp Locating equipment became extremely difficult. nbsp Overhead and job-site delays increased. Operational expenses quickly rose. Billing became more complex and time-consuming. Complaints about dangerous driving escalated. If you rsquo ve experienced one or more of the pain points above, you rsquo ll want to continue reading. As we dive deeper into the KeepBuilding use case, we rsquo ll also explain how construction fleet management software can help you work more efficiently. 1. Find equipment faster Dozens of vehicles, trailers, and equipment spread across three job sites and a yard, making it difficult to locate vehicles or assets. KeepBuilding had a lot to manage. For example, locating their 70-foot-long excavator required multiple phone calls and site yard checks. This wasted time and led to various project delays. nbsp As their company grew, the problem just got worse. They needed to find their equipment at a moment rsquo s notice to get their projects back on schedule. nbsp The solution KeepBuilding adds a GPS construction fleet tracking system that allows them to locate their vehicles, trailers, and equipment in real time. By adding the GPS, they can now do a quick search for any vehicle or asset to view its location on a single map. This allows KeepBuilding to spend less time searching for equipment and more time using it. Taking this first step in their construction equipment fleet management program pays off immediately. 2. Provide automatic ETA updates nbsp Construction is a business of dependencies. If one piece of equipment is missing, it can have a ripple effect on the rest of the day and possibly for days to come. KeepBuilding experienced this firsthand, and staff found themselves spending a lot of time calling job site project managers to update them with equipment and employee ETAs. nbsp The solution KeepBuilding implements construction fleet management software and sets up automated ETA notifications. Now project managers can view ETAs at any point, they also receive an alert upon arrival. This allows them to plan the day efficiently and focus on their projects. nbsp nbsp 3. Recover stolen equipment or assets Theft accounts for losses of about 1 billion per year in the construction industry. KeepBuilding also had to manage equipment theft that cost the company valuable time, resources, and money. Losing key equipment also disrupted operations the following day and led to project delays. nbsp The solution With GPS tracking in place, KeepBuilding can now identify the location of missing equipment and vehicles in real time. They rsquo re also able to approach the problem proactively. By creating geofences around job sites and yards, they receive immediate notifications when a vehicle or asset enters or leaves a location when it shouldn rsquo t. This allows them to intervene right away and increases the odds of recovery. nbsp 4. Take yard or job site inventory instantly Taking inventory of equipment and vehicles is an important and regular process for KeepBuilding. As they grew and the number of job sites increased, this process quickly became time intensive and error prone. The solution KeepBuilding automates a good portion of its inventory process by creating a drag-and-drop geofence around each yard and job site to assist in construction fleet tracking . With a single click, they now have a real-time list of the assets inside each geofence. KeepBuilding rsquo s inventory process has gone from hours to seconds. nbsp 5. Bill customers faster and more accurately nbsp KeepBuilding commonly bills customers based on the amount of time equipment is used at a job site. As they grew and they began using their equipment across more job sites, manual tracking by the hour became a bigger headache. nbsp The solution With job-site geofencing , KeepBuilding now racks exactly how much time any piece of equipment spends at each job site during any time period, simplifying their billing process. 6. Efficiently manage equipment and vehicle inventory Managing the number of vehicles and other equipment needed in your construction fleet is a difficult balance. If you buy too few, you may experience project delays. If you buy too many, profit margins are basically depreciating in your yard. nbsp Without insight into usage, purchases are made on an educated guess. It rsquo s especially important to gain insight into real needs as a company experiences growth. The solution KeepBuilding is learning to manage its equipment and other assets more efficiently with fleet utilization reporting . This reporting is based on vital fleet information that rsquo s gathered, organized, consolidated, and analyzed. nbsp nbsp With this data, KeepBuilding can now Identify the types of equipment they may have a shortage of in case of breakdowns or unexpected growth. Redeploy underutilized equipment to existing job sites to get projects done faster. Sell underutilized equipment vehicles or lease rent more equipment during busy seasons. 7. Monitor and reduce idle time Between transportation and equipment usage, construction uses a lot of fuel. With their business growth, KeepBuilding rsquo s fuel costs gradually consumed a larger percentage of revenue. They couldn rsquo t quite pinpoint why it increased so abruptly until they saw a study outlining idling costs. This study pointed out that some vehicles burn .8 gallons of fuel per hour . At a fuel price of 2.61, idling for just one hour per day costs 542 per vehicle annually. While there rsquo s more variance in terms of construction equipment, the same idea holds true. Idling costs money. The solution When KeepBuilding adds construction fleet management software , they rsquo re surprised to see how much time their vehicles are idling at job sites. These idling reports allow KeepBuilding to quickly identify and address excessive idling. KeepBuilding even begins to compensate project managers who reduce idling rates, making fuel savings a financial win-win. 8. Prevent vehicle and equipment misuse Misuse of vehicles and equipment is a common battle for construction companies like KeepBuilding whose employees take vehicles home with them. This includes using company vehicles for personal errands or side jobs. nbsp Even if it rsquo s just a few employees, the extra usage adds up. nbsp The solution To prevent misuse of company property, KeepBuilding sets up a geofence around job sites and yards to help them with their construction fleet tracking. They now receive alerts whenever vehicles or equipment move when they shouldn rsquo t. Once they identify a possible off-hours issue, they use the location history report to see exactly where vehicles and assets have been and when they were there. In addition to identifying improper usage, having this capability tends to be a strong deterrent against misuse. 9. Get real-time fault code reporting and alerts nbsp Fleet maintenance can be expensive. Experiencing a vehicle breakdown is even more expensive. This is especially true for a business like KeepBuilding. Beyond direct costs like replacement parts and mechanical labor, KeepBuilding found that indirect costs were their real problem. As an example, let rsquo s look at a truck that breaks down while bringing a backhoe to a job site. The delay puts excavation off until the next day. In addition, the soils engineer can rsquo t do their open-hole inspection as planned. They don rsquo t have availability for an additional three days. This delays the next step and the next. nbsp The solution While some breakdowns are inevitable, KeepBuilding significantly reduces breakdowns by taking a proactive maintenance approach. nbsp A vehicle rsquo s onboard diagnostic system already monitors for issues known as fault codes. KeepBuilding rsquo s new fleet management solution captures, interprets, and displays fault codes into an easy-to-read, actionable report. This allows them to catch vehicle maintenance issues early with real-time alerts. KeepBuilding uses this data to Provide their maintenance staff and external mechanics with a complete list of vehicle defects so they can resolve every issue in a single appointment. Ensure vehicles with critical issues are taken off the road, preventing the issue from becoming more serious. Save time and money because they no longer need to run diagnostics in the shop. 10. Get mileage and time-based maintenance reminders Equipment, vehicles, trailers, and other assets often need maintenance based on mileage, usage, and time. You can often reduce breakdowns and increase an asset rsquo s lifespan by staying ahead of maintenance schedules. This is often more difficult than it sounds. As KeepBuilding grew and its number of assets expanded, keeping up with its fleet rsquo s maintenance schedules became a headache. nbsp The solution KeepBuilding sets up automated maintenance reminders in their construction equipment fleet management program based on mileage, usage, and time mdash based on each type of vehicle or asset. With maintenance reminders and usage visibility, KeepBuilding reduces its overall equipment upkeep costs. nbsp 11. Prevent collisions Prior to implementing a fleet management solution, the first collision occurred in one of KeepBuilding rsquo s fleet vehicles. While nobody was injured, the event spurred management to reconsider risk. They looked at several facts The average collision costs 91,000 and 200,000 if there rsquo s an injury. A single severe collision can increase insurance rates and impact a business rsquo s ability to extend credit lines from banks . Dangerous driving behavior can impact your brand and sales since your fleet vehicles are a moving billboard for your business. nbsp They knew they needed to improve safety to protect the future of KeepBuilding. nbsp The solution They install AI dash cams that track and coach drivers in real time when dangerous or distracted driving occurs. These AI dash cams lead to a lower insurance premium while protecting their fleet by recording their own, and other drivers, to see who rsquo s really at fault in future collisions. 12. Identify and coach the most dangerous drivers To prevent dangerous driving , KeepBuilding first had to identify it. They knew it had to be a top priority due to the complaints coming in. nbsp The increase in complaints was most likely due to hiring quickly to meet demand mdash and hiring some more inexperienced drivers. The solution KeepBuilding begins to monitor the Safety Score of all of its drivers. This score is a calculation of not only dangerous driving events such as hard brakes, accelerations, and corners, but also positive driving behaviors. It also takes into account the context and severity of every safety event, assigning more weight to behaviors that are likely to lead to collisions. nbsp With this information, KeepBuilding identifies its most dangerous drivers. They find it especially helpful to monitor new driver performance and provide coaching so their drivers learn to meet company expectations. When a dangerous driver is identified, KeepBuilding can view the full details for each driving event along with the cause, whether it be tailgating or the driver having been cut off. nbsp KeepBuilding can also watch the event for themselves in HD video with a single click. KeepBuilding can then coach drivers on what to do differently in the future and track their progress with coaching statuses. Drivers can even watch their own videos from an app. As an unexpected bonus, KeepBuilding found that reducing aggressive driving increased fuel efficiency by 20-30 . 13. Protect against litigation nbsp Unfortunately, collisions happen. And often, it won rsquo t be your driver rsquo s fault. While there was no litigation in KeepBuilding rsquo s accident, it raised the question, ldquo If there was litigation, could we prove what happened? rdquo nbsp Without video evidence, for any company managing a large fleet, the answer may be no. The solution To limit their risk, KeepBuilding adds a dash cam. With video evidence of critical events and the ability to recall videos from the past, they rsquo re able to defend themselves in situations where they aren rsquo t at fault. Why use Motive as your construction fleet management software? While KeepBuilding is a fictional example, its problems, solutions, and results are based on real construction businesses that have used Motive to get visibility into their business, automate manual work, reduce operational costs, and prevent collisions . nbsp nbsp If your business is facing some of the same challenges as KeepBuilding, request a demo and we rsquo ll show you how we can help you build a better way to work.\n",

            "Women make up less than 10 of nationwide truck drivers Fleets can do more to support women in trucking Technology also makes it easier to attract women to the industry nbsp The trucking industry is actively seeking to add women drivers. The effort has paid off with a consistent growth of women in trucking over the past decade. But female truck drivers remain a minority in the industry. There rsquo s a continued need to support women in trucking. This article examines the current environment for women in truck driving and how to improve the situation even further. nbsp Important female truck drivers statistics The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that in 2020 only 12.4 of the trucking transportation industry employees were female. But there has been a real push recently to get more female truck drivers out on the road. For one thing, women drivers are 20 less likely to be involved in a crash than their male counterparts, according to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act . nbsp What percent of truck drivers are female? Women make up only 7 of all drivers, ldquo well below their representation in the total workforce, rdquo according to the American Trucking Associations . That equates to approximately 250,000 female drivers in the United States. According to the 2019 Women in Trucking Index , the number of women executives of motor carriers is on the rise. The WIT reported 24 year-over-year growth in executive levels. Plus the Index found women made up ldquo 43.5 of the overall non-executive workforce in trucking companies non-executive employees include recruiters, driver managers, dispatchers, salespeople and administrative workers . rdquo Using Department of Labor figures, Women in Trucking WIT estimates there has been an ldquo 88 increase in female drivers rdquo from 2010 to 2021. What is the average female truck driver s salary? Median annual wages for heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers was 48,310 in May 2021, the most recent figure available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics . The highest 10 of drivers earned more than 72,730 while the lowest 10 were earning less than 30,710. nbsp The average female truck driver rsquo s salary is the same as that for male counterparts. According to Ellen Voie of Women in Trucking , ldquo As a truck driver, you make the same amount of money as your male peers, because you either get paid by the mile or the load of the percentage. So gender is not an issue in pay in the truck industry for drivers. rdquo Benefits of recruiting women in the trucking industry There is a dramatic shortage of truck drivers available today. The national shortfall is estimated at approximately 80,000 drivers, according to the ATA . Further, ldquo at current trends, the shortage could surpass 160,000 in 2030. rdquo Encouraging women to enter the trucking industry could help to address the driver shortage. nbsp But that rsquo s not the only reason to engage women in the trucking industry. The Women in Trucking Association notes having more female truckers also Brings new perspectives Fuels greater idea generation, problem solving, and innovation Increases business performance and overall revenue generation Judging by the Jobs Act statistic above about fewer accidents, women are safer on the road too. What challenges do female truck drivers face? Female truck drivers face several obstacles in trying to enter and remain in the industry. Rigorous work schedules can be challenging for female truck drivers who would benefit from more flexible work arrangements. Fair compensation remains a problem. Additionally, if the fleet does not have an inclusive corporate culture, the female driver may not be encouraged or supported in professional development or career advancement. nbsp Female truck drivers can be treated differently than their male counterparts. They may not be selected as often for big hauls, may be subjected to inappropriate advances, and might face disparaging comments about their work. All these can undermine the drivers rsquo morale and make it more difficult for fleets to retain their qualified female truckers . Best trucking companies for women To find a job as a female truck driver, you might start looking online at job sites and the Women in Trucking careers site. Women in Trucking WIT also posts a list of Top 50 Companies for Women to Work for in Transportation . The listing looks for ldquo corporate cultures that foster gender diversity competitive compensation and benefits flexible hours and work requirements professional development opportunities and career advancement opportunities. rdquo Most recently, the companies recognized by WIT included ADM Trucking BCB Transport Carter Express Dart Transit Company Estes Express Lines Frito Lay Jetco Delivery Landstar Transportation Logistics PACCAR Ryder Schneider Trimble UPS XPO Logistics Motive rsquo s own Chelsea Kendrick and Krissy Manzano were also recently named Top Women to Watch in Transportation by WIT . Chelsea is a Customer Education Manager while Krissy is our Senior Director of Sales. Another option is to start a female-owned trucking company or join one that is woman owned. Understanding load boards , an online resource to help find loads that need delivered, can be a good starting point for women starting their own trucking companies. nbsp What support is there for women truckers? National and regional trucking groups welcome women trucker members. At the same time, groups also specifically target female truckers. Additionally, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission offers protection from discrimination and harassment. Women in Trucking Association The Women Trucking Association is a good resource for information about women truck drivers. Founded in 2007, this non-profit organization aims to create a community for professional drivers, encourage women rsquo s employment, and address obstacles facing female truckers. nbsp Want a firsthand view of what it means to be a female trucker ? Read the perspective of Desiree Wood, a 10-year trucker and founder of REAL Women in Trucking. Women in trucking scholarship The Women in Trucking Foundation offers scholarships to ldquo any female who will be attending a training facility for the purpose of advancing their career in the areas of safety, driving, technical, or leadership in the trucking industry. rdquo Applications are accepted in the Spring and the Fall for the 1,000 in funding.

            "What is a reefer trailer? Reefer trailers, or refrigerated trailers, are insulated trailers with built-in refrigeration units. They rsquo re designed for cold chain transport, delivering perishable cargo at safe and consistent temperatures. This includes fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meats, chemicals, and flowers. nbsp How does a refrigerated trailer work? Reefers are equipped with a closed refrigeration system designed to remove heat from a trailer in order to maintain the temperature of a product during transportation . They rsquo re not designed to actually cool a product. nbsp They function through three main components Evaporator coil Compressor Small diesel engine The engine powers the compressor, which powers the evaporator coil. As the air inside of a trailer moves due to differences in air pressure, it passes over the evaporator coil. The coil removes heat from the air and feeds the cooler air back into the trailer. nbsp To ensure the refrigeration system works properly during cold chain transport, many drivers use reefer trailer temperature recorders or trailer temperature monitoring systems. How much does a reefer trailer cost? Used reefers, with no guarantee of service, can be found as low as 4,000. A new Thermo King trailer, on the other hand, can run about 100,000. nbsp How much do reefers weigh? Although some trailers differ, the standard reefer trailer has a tare weight of about 12,500 pounds with an additional 2,000 pounds for the refrigeration unit. nbsp How cold can reefer trailers get? Standard reefers are designed to maintain temperatures between -17 730 C and 10 730 C for proper cold chain transportation. Although they can get as cold as -150 730 C for cryogenic transport. nbsp How much fuel does a reefer trailer use? Standard reefer trailers use between 0.4 and 1.1 gallons of diesel per hour. How much weight can a refrigerated trailer carry? Reefer trailers are designed to be as strong and light as possible so you can haul maximum cold chain product without exceeding the federal GVWR 80,000 pounds for dual axels or 90,000 pounds if you have a third axle . nbsp The GVWR counts more than just the weight in the trailer. This combined weight includes The truck The driver Personal property Truck fuel Reefer fuel The trailer Product in the trailer To illustrate, check out this short use case. You rsquo re driving a truck that weighs 14,000 pounds including yourself, your personal property, and fuel , and your trailer weighs 13,000 pounds. You have a standard two-axle trailer, which means you can legally weigh 80,000 pounds. The difference between the GVWR and your current weight is 53,000 pounds, so that rsquo s how much cold chain freight you can carry. What rsquo s a reefer trailer used for? A variety of cargo needs to be kept at a constant temperature during cold chain transportation in order to ensure safety and quality. Refrigerated trailers haul this cargo. Common types of cold chain or perishable cargo include nbsp Food and beverages. This is the most common type of cargo transported in refrigerated trailers. This includes everything from fresh produce to frozen food. Pharmaceuticals. Medications are often temperature sensitive and must be shipped in a controlled environment to maintain potency and or effectiveness. nbsp Hazardous materials. To remain stable, some chemicals and other hazardous materials must not exceed certain temperatures. They rsquo re shipped in refrigerated trailers to ensure safety during transportation. Electronics. Some electronics can be damaged by extreme temperatures. This sensitive electronic equipment is often shipped via refrigerated trailers. nbsp Artwork. High-value works of art can be at risk in uncontrolled temperature environments. These paintings and other types of artwork are often shipped in refrigerated trailers to protect them during transport. nbsp Other items that should be shipped in reefers include candles, chewing gum, tobacco, and paint. Many fleets use reefer trailer temperature recorders, or trailer temperature monitoring systems, to ensure they re delivering their products in the ideal environments and staying in compliance. Reefer trailer compliance The temperatures at which certain goods must be stored during cold chain transportation, such as human and animal food, fall under federal regulations. nbsp All companies that are involved in cold chain transport, or transporting temperature-controlled foods, must adhere to the Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food as cited in the FSMA mandate . These companies must Maintain adequate temperature controls to ensure food safety. Retain records of transportation conditions for 12 months.

            "The early 2020s have been volatile for the supply chain, leaving many wondering the best way to innovate and make improvements. In recent years, last-mile delivery has been a huge topic of interest for fleet managers looking to run their supply chains as efficiently as possible. Middle-mile logistics is now entering the conversation. What is middle-mile logistics? The transportation of goods between two facilities is an operation known as middle-mile logistics, and it rsquo s a critical phase in the supply chain. Warehouses temporarily store products received from a supplier or production center. From these warehouses, goods are sent to a second facility that ships items to customers or stores. nbsp After the manufacturing phase, products typically have long journeys before they rsquo re finally in customers rsquo hands. These long journeys with multiple destinations require companies to take great care to ensure that shipments happen in the most economical and efficient way. nbsp Why is middle-mile delivery important? Any efficiency that companies can find in their operations could mean getting an important edge on competition. To maintain this competitive edge, companies must do what they can to make innovations to the middle-mile delivery process, even though innovations can be difficult in a well-established infrastructure. Focusing on middle-mile delivery is important because those companies that do start tackling this area now will be in a position to soar beyond competition. To make meaningful improvements to middle-mile logistics, it rsquo s important to understand the key differences between middle-mile and last-mile logistics. nbsp Middle-mile vs. last-mile logistics Last-mile logistics is widely known within the fleet management sector as an area of great importance. Making sure goods make it from distribution centers to customers is critical to customer satisfaction, especially now that so many consumers are routinely ordering goods to be delivered to their homes. The importance of last-mile delivery grew along with the growing popularity of eCommerce, but middle-mile logistics hasn rsquo t become a topic as widely discussed as last-mile logistics yet. nbsp The most notable difference between middle-mile and last-mile logistics is what locations products get shipped to. Middle-mile delivery only has to do with the movement of goods between warehouses and distribution centers, but last-mile delivery refers to the shipment of goods from a logistics center to its end point, the customer or a retail location selling directly to consumers. As far as logistical phases go, the last mile is the most complex. Moving goods from major distribution centers either directly to customers or to physical locations to be sold involves a much higher number of different destinations to coordinate and contend with. In contrast, middle-mile logistics only involves warehouses and established shipping points. This smaller network of locations, all established specifically to transport goods, allows warehouses and distribution centers to coordinate directly with carriers to optimize the shipping process. nbsp For middle-mile delivery to be most successful, warehouses must be able to coordinate in the most efficient way possible. The amount of goods delivered has to match the amount of available storage space the facility has, and the goods must be delivered during a window that the facility is open for operations. nbsp Those in charge of warehouse operations have to work to facilitate the pickup of goods from carriers, making adjustments in the operations according to the route and carrier delivering each shipment. nbsp One other notable difference between middle-mile and last-mile delivery is in the size of the load being transported. Middle-mile delivery deals with much larger amounts of product, mainly shipped in bulk on pallets. Because last-mile deliveries are taking goods directly to stores or customers, they deal with much smaller loads that are usually in boxes or smaller packaging. nbsp Advantages of mid-mile delivery Making adjustments to mid-mile delivery practices uniquely positions companies to make significant improvements to their logistical operations. Because optimizing the last mile of deliveries has long been a point of focus, there is not nearly as much room left for innovation in that space. This scenario leaves mid-mile delivery as the area with the biggest room for growth and for companies to make adjustments that set them apart from the competition. The main advantages of optimizing mid-mile delivery are Cost reduction Saving money is a huge advantage of mid-mile delivery. Optimizing the middle mile can often come easier to companies because they have control of both the beginning and end of the middle segment of the supply chain . Having this control helps companies reduce inefficiencies quicker, leading to a valuable reduction in costs. Competitive advantage By making optimizations to mid-mile operations and generating cost savings, companies can pass these savings onto customers without suffering a lower profit margin. This will allow for a competitive edge in a market where many companies are looking to maintain margins without raising costs. nbsp Greater adaptability Companies who own their own mid-mile operations see a smaller number of errors, better utilization of assets, and greater control. Taking greater control over mid-mile delivery operations puts companies in a better position to adapt to changes quickly and efficiently. nbsp Common challenges associated with middle-mile transportation Optimizing middle-mile delivery operations has big benefits for fleet management companies. There are a few common challenges associated with optimizing middle-mile transportation to be aware of nbsp Lack of visibility in the warehouse Warehouses can encounter issues like lost assets, late shipments, and inventory discrepancies. Losing inventory in the warehouse is costly, and getting a handle on this loss is one of the bigger challenges associated with optimizing middle-mile transportation. Optimizing routes between distribution centers One aspect of the middle mile that companies must make sure to master early is finding the most efficient routes between distribution centers. Fleet management software with GPS tracking capabilities takes the guesswork out of finding the best routes, and is extremely beneficial when it comes to solving the challenge of optimizing routes. nbsp Getting technology into warehouses Related to the challenge of lack of visibility in warehouses is the need for companies to modernize their warehouse operations and introduce reliable tracking technology to avoid lost assets and maintain better inventory records. A challenge for a lot of companies is making the transition to digital when they have long relied on manual tracking methods, but it rsquo s a necessary transition for optimizing the middle mile. Top tips to improve your middle-mile logistics Improve your middle-mile logistics with these tips Install a warehouse management system . Using an inventory management system in your warehouse provides you with much needed control over your inventory. It also allows you to arrange merchandise exactly according to your specifications. Refine your shipping and receiving process . Shipping and receiving must move as smoothly as possible to help improve your middle-mile logistics operation. Having efficient operations helps to increase the speed of transportation of goods between different warehouses. nbsp Use technology to plan better routes .

            "Transporting perishable goods is big business. Perishable goods make up many of the items consumers purchase regularly, like food products, pharmaceuticals, flowers, candles, paint, and chewing gum. These types of goods are categorized as reefer freight, meaning they require refrigeration because they have the potential to spoil or damage at high temperatures. nbsp To maintain the low temperatures needed to transport perishable goods, fleets use reefer trailers. What is a reefer trailer? A reefer trailer is insulated and contains a refrigeration unit in order to maintain temperature control for items that require low temperatures. Reefer trailers can be up to 53 feet long but do also come in a variety of sizes. Companies rely on reefer trailers to transport perishable goods. In addition to the prevention of spoiled or damaged goods, certain perishable goods, like human and animal food, are under federal regulations when it comes to the temperature at which they must be stored. nbsp The Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food, cited in the FSMA mandate , affects companies involved in the transportation of temperature-controlled foods, including shippers, carriers, loaders, and receivers. These companies must Maintain adequate temperature controls to ensure food safety. Retain records of transportation conditions for 12 months. Provide the operating temperature to the receiver and demonstrate that it has maintained temperature conditions during the transportation. Reefer trailer temperature ranges Reefer trailer temperature ranges depend on the type of perishable cargo being transported. A few of the most common types of perishable cargo and their corresponding temperature ranges are listed below. Pharmaceuticals The reefer trailer temperature range for pharmaceuticals can be large and must be verified by the product rsquo s manufacturer. Because temperature ranges for pharmaceutical cargo can be different based on the chemical composition of the items, temperature ranges work a bit differently for pharmaceuticals. nbsp A common reefer trailer temperature range breakdown for pharmaceuticals looks like this 20-25 730 C for room temperature 2-8 730 C for refrigerated Below 0 730 C to as low as -150 730 C for cryogenic Meat, Poultry, Fish, and Dairy Meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products should be kept in temperatures of 40 730 F or lower. These types of meat and dairy products can grow bacteria harmful to those who consume them if they rsquo re not kept at the proper temperature to prevent bacteria growth. nbsp Produce Like pharmaceuticals, produce is also stored at different temperatures based on the type of produce. Certain product types can cope with higher temperatures better than others. A good example provided by Hale Trailer is that while lettuce will wilt at a higher temperature, citrus and melons can handle warmer conditions better. nbsp According to Hale, these reefer trailer temperature ranges are considered the best for the following types of produce 32-36 730 F for greens, berries, apples, cruciferous vegetables, grapes, and stone fruits 38-40 730 F for avocados and cranberries 40-45 730 F for potatoes, green beans, and sweet potatoes 45-50 730 F for watermelon, cucumbers, some citrus, bananas, and tomatoes Plants and Florals Plants and other florals are commonly transported using reefer trailers, since these types of goods can wilt or lose freshness when not kept in cooler and more stable temperatures. Most plants and florals are kept at 33 730 F. nbsp Benefits of reefer trailer temperature monitoring Because of factors like global climate change and shifting consumer habits, more and more companies are looking to reefer trailers to transport perishable goods. To maintain the proper and efficient operations in reefer trailers, companies rely on refrigerated truck temperature monitoring. Three of the main benefits of reefer trailer temperature monitoring are Compliance with the FSMA . Reefer trailers help companies stay compliant with the FSMA mandate , keeping human and animal food items at the temperatures necessary to avoid harmful effects to those consuming them. Reefer tracking technology helps with storing and maintaining temperature logs for the required 12 months after the transportation agreement. Reefer temperature monitoring technology also helps with providing a vehicle rsquo s necessary operating temperatures, demonstrating that it has maintained temperature conditions during the transportation. Lower reefer operating costs . Outdated reefer tracking software to monitor reefer units can result in higher costs when it comes to operating reefer trailers. More sophisticated refrigerated truck temperature monitoring allows for more efficiencies in fuel usage and maintenance, as well as the prevention of misuse and overuse. These factors combined can help lower overall costs associated with maintaining reefer trailers. Remote reefer controls . One temperature programming error is a costly mistake that could result in damage to freight. Reefer trailer temperature monitoring technology allows for the remote control of reefer temperatures, which helps to avoid errors caused by manual temperature programming by individual drivers. The ability to remotely monitor and control temperature programs helps to maintain accuracy and efficiency. Tips for effective reefer monitoring Effective reefer monitoring can mean the difference between damaged or undamaged cargo, increased or decreased profits, and satisfied or unsatisfied customers. Ineffective reefer monitoring practices can also mean non-compliance with federal mandates. nbsp To make sure you rsquo re maintaining effective reefer monitoring practices, it rsquo s helpful to start with making sure you are following the four key requirements of the FSMA mandate Vehicles and transportation equipment . Design and maintain vehicle and transportation equipment to ensure that it doesn rsquo t cause the food that it transports to become unsafe. For example, vehicles must be suitable and adequately clean for their intended use and capable of maintaining temperatures necessary for the safe transport of food. Transportation operations . Take measures during transportation to ensure food safety, such as adequate temperature controls, preventing contamination of ready-to-eat food from touching raw food, protection of food from contamination by non-food items in the same load or previous load, and protection of food from cross-contact, i.e., the unintentional incorporation of a food allergen. Training . Train carrier personnel in sanitary transportation practices and documentation of the training. Carriers covered by the rule are required to provide food safety training to transportation operations personnel when the carrier and shipper agree that the carrier is responsible for sanitary conditions during transport. Learn more in this FDA Training Module . Records . Maintain records of written procedures, agreements, and training required of carriers . The required retention time for these records depends upon the type of record and when the covered activity occurred, but does not exceed 12 months. How to choose the right reefer monitoring system To maximize the benefits you can get from your reefer temperature tracking system, make sure you choose a system with the capabilities to help you comply with FSMA regulations, lower the cost of your reefer operations, and reduce reefer programming errors. You rsquo ll want a reefer temperature tracking system with features such as Temperature log access . The right reefer monitoring system will give you full access to your temperature logs to view in real time and the ability to export logs with historical temperature data. Complete dashboard . You need a reefer temperature tracking system with a complete dashboard that shows real-time environmental data alongside driver and vehicle insights. Environmental sensor . A reefer monitoring system needs environmental sensors that support multi-temperature zones within reefer trailers that can be placed anywhere in a trailer to capture humidity and temperature levels. nbsp Remote control capabilities . Make sure your reefer monitoring system has remote control capabilities so you can minimize costly errors and save drivers time by remote controlling reefer units.

            "A construction company needs to get a dozer to a jobsite. An aircraft manufacturer needs to get a new fuselage to a customer. An energy firm needs to get a steel transformer to a remote location to power a community. Oversized loads, or small but but heavy cargo, often require special processes and heavy hauling to be employed. nbsp Know how to be the most cost-effective and efficient when heavy hauling mdash transporting large, heavy, or oversized loads. What is heavy hauling? As far as the federal government is concerned a heavy load exceeds 80,000 pounds of gross vehicle weight 20,000 pounds of single axle weight 34,000 pounds of tandem axle weight Heavy hauling is common in transportation, agriculture , construction , and other industries. Heavy-haul trucking transports oversized items such as industrial machinery, military or farming equipment, and construction materials. You might also see these industries transporting large items that need to follow hazardous materials regulations . nbsp Consider these things when heavy hauling Transporting heavy, large, or oversized loads requires extra attention from carriers. As with all shipping, the distance the cargo is traveling and the desired time to delivery will factor into your decisions about how to transport. Yet, unlike full truck load or less-than-truckload LTL shipments , transporting heavy and oversized loads is a more involved process. First, you may need special equipment to handle the heavy, wide, or oversize load. Trucks hauling these large or oversized loads may also be required to travel with Safety flags Additional lights Escort vehicles Banners When shipping cargo over the road, you may need an overweight or oversize load permit. The rules for heavy hauling can vary by state as well. For instance, one state may prohibit oversized loads on major highways while another limits the hours those loads can be on the road. Heavy hauling best practices Follow these best practices for help with heavy or oversized loads and for greater peace of mind. Inventory your shipment Know the exact measurements of your cargo in order to get the right permits, equipment, and tools. Make sure your drivers can safely load, secure, move, and deliver their cargo. Know the rules Follow state or federal regulations for heavy, large, or oversized loads mdash and reduce the chances of a delayed delivery. As mentioned above, there are varied requirements depending on the shipment rsquo s measurements, what it includes, and where it rsquo s traveling. Plan ahead Research transportation rules in advance. Trying to rush a heavy, large, or oversize load compounds transportation difficulty. A heavy or oversize load may require special vehicles, equipment, and skilled drivers. nbsp Take advantage of technology Use fleet management software to gain greater visibility into each of your shipments. As a carrier, fleet management software helps you improve the planning and execution of heavy hauling and delivery. An easy-to-use, flexible system can drive greater efficiency, improve driver safety, and increase overall profitability. How much does heavy hauling cost? The costs for transporting large, heavy, or oversized loads varies depending on several considerations. In addition to distance traveled and the timeframe required for delivery, you rsquo ll also need to factor in the weight, size, and type of cargo you rsquo re shipping. If the heavy or large cargo makes for a wide load or requires a heavy-duty truck, that will mean greater costs. Transporting large or heavy loads of hazardous materials also means more risks and regulations, so that can also affect transportation cost as well. Expediting delivery also adds to your overall costs. nbsp How to pack cargo for heavy haul loads Know how to pack large, heavy, or oversize items to reduce costs and improve the safety and security of your load. Ultimately, the more efficiently you pack, the lower your freight costs. Let rsquo s look at a few considerations Choose durable packaging if your heavy shipment is packaged and not a piece of heavy equipment on a flatbed . Due to the size and bulk of the items, the shipment could endure more wear and tear. It rsquo s a good practice to package your cargo to withstand shocks. Heavy, large, and oversized loads are more likely to be lifted by forklifts or hydraulic lift and could be moved from truck to truck several times on a delivery route. nbsp Brace your cargo. Fill any empty spaces to avoid the items moving around when en route. Secure all shipments safely to reduce risks when in motion. Heavy items risk getting dropped, will be subject to vibrations, and could experience compression from other items when stacked. Pallets can be useful to move heavy and larger loads as they are built to be hauled and lifted. If your goods are fragile, ship them with extra care. You don rsquo t want to risk damage during shipping. That can lead to expensive returns and refunds and diminished customer satisfaction. Take accurate measurements. Know the weight, length, and girth involved. This data can also help with shipping insurance if and when it rsquo s needed , which can help cut risks. Label the cargo clearly to simplify unloading and loading and to let any inspectors know what the packages contain. This helps your drivers avoid hurdles. nbsp How Motive can help when heavy hauling Identify efficiencies when shipping large items, heavy-haul trucking, or adding the hazmat considerations.

            "Hear from leaders in the trucking and construction industries about simple ways to reduce fleet fuel costs and improve fleet fuel economy. This webinar, Cutting Fuel Costs with the Help of Technology, is now available on demand. Listen to the webinar now . Steve Keppler of Scopelitis Transportation Consulting moderated a discussion, featuring thoughtful insight from Dave Schaller of the North American Council for Freight Efficiency Melinda Tomaino of the Associated General Contractors of America Aaron Patterson, Director of Operations at Keller Trucking Get a quick recap of how to reduce fleet fuel costs and improve fleet fuel economy as described in this discussion. nbsp Best practices to reduce fleet fuel costs and consumption Across the transportation industry, fuel is vital to executing work, whether that requires moving loads between cities or across jobsites. With labor shortages in trucking and construction, ldquo it rsquo s hard enough to get drivers in the seat, much less inspire them to make the decisions fleets want them to, rdquo Schaller said. Companies looking to get more from their fuel strategy have great options. The North American Council for Freight Efficiency , where Schaller works as Industry Engagement Director, encourages fleets to be mindful of vehicle aerodynamics and the impact of wind pressure on fleet fuel efficiency. Simple tricks like using low-rolling resistance tires, parking on concrete instead of blacktop, or avoiding hard braking can conserve fuel and reduce fleet fuel costs as well. Fleets have worked hard to scale back idling, especially in response to high fuel prices. ldquo From a fuel conservation standpoint, reduced idling is one of the most immediate options available, rdquo Tomaino said. ldquo As one of our members likes to say, lsquo the worst mileage a vehicle can have is zero miles per gallon. rsquo rdquo Reduced idling can provide various savings and benefits , Tomaino added, depending on the size and type of vehicle. nbsp Inspiring drivers to plan for better fleet fuel economy Achieving the best fleet fuel economy involves smart planning from managers and drivers. Keller Trucking monitors fuel prices constantly, coaching drivers to be mindful of routing, safety, and fueling options mdash all of which play into fleet fuel economy. nbsp ldquo We incentivize drivers on the decisions that they make, ranking their decisions from best to worst, rdquo Patterson said. ldquo From an operational standpoint, there rsquo s nothing more frustrating than seeing a driver go off an exit with four truck stops right there and choosing the fuel with the highest price. rdquo Listen to the webinar on demand for smart tips to reduce fleet fuel costs and to get a look at what rsquo s coming in alternative fuels.\n",

            "Starting today, we rsquo re expanding the Motive Automated Operations Platform to monitor refrigerated fleets beyond Thermo King trailer units . nbsp Reefer fleets today still rely on manual processes to analyze temperature logs, manage trailer uptime, and program trailer refrigeration units. It rsquo s estimated that up to 20 of temperature-controlled freight spoils in transit. The consequences of a poorly maintained and monitored reefer unit extend far beyond monetary losses when compromised cargo like food and drugs can endanger consumer safety. Our new Environmental Sensor remotely monitors the reefer temperature and humidity conditions in real time. In a single dashboard, Motive customers can now automate their reefer management, view reefer telematics, and access temperature logs while eliminating errors and reducing operating costs. nbsp The Reefer Monitoring solution also makes it possible to generate temperature logs from any time period on demand without the need to visit a dealer rsquo s service, which reduces cost, decreases reefer downtime, and improves the service that fleets can provide to their own customers. It also helps fleets to comply with the Food Safety Modernization Act FSMA requirements. Versatile and precise hardware We designed the Environmental Sensor to be flexible with any cold chain logistics business mdash including companies transporting food, beverages, crops, flowers, medication, etc. The sensor can be easily mounted on any trailer surface and has a replaceable lithium battery that will last 3 ndash 5 years. nbsp Each device contains an internal temperature sensor that captures measurements within -0.5 ordm C 1 ordm F accuracy range at a one-minute sample rate, as well as an internal humidity sensor that can measure the relative humidity between 0-95 at a one-minute sample rate. The Environmental Sensor connects to the Motive Asset Gateway Solar via Bluetooth, leveraging cellular connectivity for data transmission to the cloud. Motive customers can create an advanced multi-zone reefer monitoring solution by connecting up to six sensors to one Asset Gateway Solar nbsp ldquo Delivering ice cream at -20 deg F when it rsquo s 90 deg F degrees outside requires us paying great attention to the conditions inside our reefers, rdquo said Marc Cain, Transportation Manager at Mayer Bros Apple Products. ldquo Motive Reefer Monitoring enables us to set the report for every 15 minutes to ensure there are no issues with the load. Having this level of visibility saves us 5 ndash 10 hours per week in fleet manager productivity and prevents any spoilage. rdquo Integrated solution Cold chain logistics is a complex business with high stakes, so it rsquo s important everything performs properly . We rsquo re helping to mitigate food spoilage, increase customer satisfaction, and lower the operating and maintenance costs of trailer reefer units by proactively detecting problems. By integrating environmental data into the Motive Automated Operations Platform, fleet managers can look at reefer trailer health within the context of their total operations. Other Motive features like dynamic ETAs, geofences , and automated vehicle trailer pairings set our solution apart from reefer point solutions. With Motive Reefer Monitoring, reefer fleet managers can manage every aspect of their fleet. nbsp At Motive, our mission is to unlock the potential of the physical economy.

            "In the e-commerce age, the customer is king. Modern customers expect their purchases to arrive quickly and affordably. The number of consumers expecting same-day delivery jumped in 2021 as shopping decisions were driven by speed, convenience, and price . Micro-fulfillment centers are one of the top ways for retailers to adapt to meet customer expectations. This article explores the trend. What is micro fulfillment? Micro fulfillment is a supply chain solution developed to help retailers meet customer demands and provide more efficient and cost-effective, last-mile delivery . nbsp After a customer places an order from a retailer, there are many steps along the way before that customer receives their goods. Once the order is processed, the product needs to be retrieved from the retailer rsquo s inventory and prepared for delivery. In the case of a national or global retailer, that inventory may need to be shipped to the local delivery area of that customer rsquo s business or home. From there, it rsquo s time for last-mile delivery . Micro-fulfillment centers make it easier for retailers to get the product out to the customer because they hold inventory locally to meet demand. This enables delivery times in hours or even minutes, rather than days. Think of prepared food subscription boxes mdash customers in New York City don rsquo t want their meat and produce on the back of a truck for days. They want the food to be fresh and local. nbsp But food and beverage retailers aren rsquo t the only companies using micro fulfillment. For example, a company may manufacture dog beds in Bend, Oregon, but the brand has a national presence thanks to its website and the convenience of online shopping. That means customers in Miami expect their orders to arrive the next day. So, this company rsquo s logistics team might open a local micro-fulfillment center near Miami to process and deliver those orders efficiently. Otherwise, a customer that doesn rsquo t want to wait days for the product to arrive from Oregon might go to the competition. How does a micro-fulfillment center work? Micro-fulfillment centers have come about in response to the e-commerce industry. At the same time, these centers could not have functioned as effectively and cost-efficiently without the advent of technology to track supply chain logistics , support online processing, and help automate picking and packing. A micro-fulfillment center can be located in an existing store or warehouse or can be a dedicated small distribution warehouse space , usually 10,000 square feet or less. These centers typically have a software solution to support order processing. They can also have robots that collect inventory from storage aisles and carry them to packing employees. nbsp These centers are localized. Taking advantage of data insights, the retailer works to identify what type of inventory is in demand in a given area so that they can stock it in that area rsquo s micro-fulfillment center. For instance, a center in Minnesota in January is unlikely to see a lot of need for sunscreen. Yet, that product might be in higher demand in sunny Southern California. The micro-fulfillment center doesn rsquo t hold all of a retailer rsquo s inventory. Instead, they typically have only one or two rsquo s day worth of inventory and are restocked regularly from larger warehouses. Pros and cons of using micro-fulfillment centers Micro-fulfillment centers accelerate delivery thanks to localized data and inventory. Automation for picking and packing in these centers also speeds up the process. The smaller size of the center can also improve accuracy and quality control. With the nearby location shortening the distance traveled, there can also be environmental benefits as products travel less distance in vehicles with lower carbon footprint. The ease of expansion is another advantage of micro-fulfillment centers. These smaller facilities are simpler and less expensive to build out in new locations as operations grow. According to Jungleworks, it rsquo s estimated ldquo MFCs can be built for a few million dollars and can be operational in a matter of months. rdquo Yet, micro-fulfillment centers aren rsquo t for every retailer. The store category, product mix, and population and customer density need to result in high order frequency and demand for rapid delivery. How to start a micro-fulfillment center As customer demand to shorten delivery times continues to escalate, micro-fulfillment strategies have grown in popularity. Retailers, both large and small, are embracing this approach as a way to generate more revenue and help lower supply chain costs. The National Retail Federation in June 2022 even hosted a webinar with Accenture and Attabotics representatives discussing how to implement micro-fulfillment to meet consumer expectations. Some of the key takeaways include Conducting market research to decide where to place micro-fulfillment centers. Opening facilities within 20 miles of high-density cities. Making centers multi-tenant to share infrastructure with other retailers for cost efficiency. Using a van delivery model to process larger shipments of orders within a shorter time frame. Combining macro- and micro-fulfillment for greater efficiency the macro center handles single pallets and replenishes the micro center, which processes multi-SKUs and prepares direct-to-consumer orders . Challenges facing micro-fulfillment startups Micro-fulfillment offers many benefits in the retail environment. Yet, there are still challenges when starting up one of these centers. nbsp For one, successful micro fulfillment requires anticipating consumer demand and predicting what stock will need replenishing where and when. There is a lot more data available today to analyze and make decisions, but it is not an exact science. Consumers, after all, are unpredictable humans no matter what the algorithms tell us . nbsp Retailers also want to offer a variety of SKUs, but that proliferation of items in inventory can be more challenging to make profitable. Stocking and tracking all that inventory, and filling all of those orders is demanding work at both the macro and micro level . Determining where to locate your micro-fulfillment center can also be daunting. You need to find affordable real estate while keeping delivery timing and the availability of reliable carriers in mind mdash plus labor availability and costs. You rsquo ll need to train human employees to interact with the technology and ensure that employees involved in picking, packing, and delivery are safe too. Finding the right technology to support the micro-fulfillment center is also critical. Software and automation are what make micro fulfillment efficient or they should . CB Insights reports , ldquo a micro-fulfillment workstation operated by one person can process 800 products per hour, compared with about 80 products collected from store shelves in an hour by a grocery picker. rdquo nbsp Find reliable tech providers that meet your business needs. The cost for technology can also be prohibitive for smaller players. Yet CB Insights predicts, as the technology continues to evolve, and demand for same-day delivery grows, the investment will become increasingly common. Features to look for in micro-fulfillment technology Successful micro fulfillment is founded on a reliable tech stack. Whether you are adding autonomous mobile robots to do picking, high-density storage solutions, or automated storage and retrieval, look for solutions offering the following features Systems integration nbsp Adding more technology but letting it stay siloed from related tools undermines the benefits of going digital. Make sure that you can integrate many of your systems in one place. You don rsquo t want to have to log separately into a Warehouse Management System WMS or ERP and possibly the Order Management System OMS or Point-of-Sale POS system to get those orders filled. Real-time tracking Technology must provide transparency into order processing, picking and packing, and delivery dispatch . With a real-time view of order progress, the business can better staff the center, plan delivery routes , and inform customers about their delivery. Being able to track assets within the center can also help productivity. For example, you might avoid employees spending 30 minutes simply trying to locate a needed lift with the ability to look online and locate that lift using GPS data. Communications optimization Keeping customers updated about their delivery in real time can boost their satisfaction with the brand. Integrating the fulfillment software with customer communications can help manage consumer expectations by keeping them well informed. Data reporting amp analytics Technology drives micro-fulfillment center success. Look for a technology that makes data reporting straightforward and offers analytical capabilities. There are many data inputs in the center mdash make the most of them by generating reports to analyze and identify trends and new business opportunities. Why use Motive to speed up your micro-fulfillment center delivery Motive rsquo s comprehensive fleet management technology nbsp can help save time and money. Solve last-mile delivery challenges with GPS tracking and a dispatch software solution to streamline processes and improve customer experience while reducing operating costs. With greater visibility into the delivery fleet , you can also reduce fuel usage, minimize vehicle breakdown, and prevent collisions mdash all of which help with efficient and cost effective deliveries while keeping drivers safe and supporting sustainability goals.\n",

            "Dry van trailers are the most common type of cargo-hauling vehicle on the road. The truck on the highway towing a large storage container is a dry van trailer. This article will share important details about dry van trailers and what the best dry van trailer companies do well. What is a dry van trailer? Dry van trailers haul a lot more cargo than a typical passenger van can manage. For example, a large shipment of up to 45,000 pounds can be loaded on a dry truck for transport over the road. nbsp Dry van companies can reliably deliver the cargo, commonly packed and wrapped on pallets and loaded and unloaded by forklift or pallet jack. They can typically do so at relatively low cost. There are also many dry van trailer companies, so customers have a good deal of flexibility. They might partner consistently with a certain company or use brokers or load boards to meet immediate needs in a certain location. nbsp Who uses dry van companies? Dry van trailers are for any non-perishable goods. When a climate-controlled environment is required, dry van companies will suggest an alternate solution. Since dry van freight can be any item that can be put on a pallet and hauled by road, the cargo includes Packaged food and beverage Consumer goods nbsp Various electronics Machinery and parts Industrial equipment Automotive parts Construction or industrial equipment Healthcare supplies Common dry van trailer rates The rate for dry van trailers will vary by carrier and location. Yet Truckstop reports that the national van rate average was 3.13 per mile in January 2022. Further, ldquo on average, the West and Midwest have the nbsp highest rates nbsp per mile, while the Northeast has the lowest. rdquo Dry van trucking rates are determined by Delivery distance How much freight is available to ship Amount of truck space available Fuel costs Season Weight and density Added requirements, such as needing lift gates or having to meet a specific drop-off window, will also impact the dry van trailer rate. Pros and cons of using dry van transportation services Dry van freight shipping offers several advantages. The wide range of things that can be shipped via dry van makes the decision easier. Then, since dry van shipments don rsquo t require special equipment or training, there are many options. That keeps the pricing down. nbsp Sending freight in a dry van is also safer than flatbed load transport. After all, the cargo is well protected from elements in the enclosed trailer. Plus, if the route is long enough that the driver needs to stop for fuel, food, or hours of service HOS reasons, the dry van can be locked up for added protection. Still, there are some cons to consider as well. For one, dry vans typically have wood flooring which can wear out from repeated use and heavy freight. This could put your cargo at risk in bad weather. Additionally, all those large trucks on the road do contribute to highway accidents. There is also an environmental impact from the fuel consumption and carbon emissions. What are the major challenges facing dry van trailer companies? nbsp Companies offering dry van transportation services do face some challenges. For one, there is a lot of competition for business. Additionally, there is a shortage of qualified drivers , which means companies compete not only for business but also for the employees to deliver those loads. Dry van drivers make money from being on the road and delivering on time. Getting stuck with a less than full truck is a problem, though deadheading driving an empty trailer is even worse. Delays due to inspection concerns or compliance issues can also be challenging. The customers don rsquo t want to hear about the headaches of a truck breaking down, being in an accident, or being held up at a weigh station. Top tips for finding the best dry van companies When you need dry van shipping, there are many companies available. Now that you know the challenges facing dry van trailers, select a business that keeps up with best practices to avoid common issues. Route optimization is a must. Work with a dry van company that has the agility to make adjustments as needed depending on weather, traffic, accidents, or other concerns. nbsp Look also at the company rsquo s safety rating. If the company has employees with good driving records and talks about their driver training and compliance efforts, you can feel better about its reliability. A company, for instance, that offers paid commercial drivers license training for their team is investing in quality staff. You might also look at their employee feedback and customer recommendations online to gauge other people rsquo s experience with that company. Time in business, size of company, and reach of their enterprise can also factor into their credibility. You can also feel better about your dry van company choice if you weigh their sustainability goals as well. Companies today can use digital technology to benchmark fuel performance and lower their environmental impact.

            "For construction, oil and gas, and other industries that rely on heavy equipment, efficiency is vital to success. Having real-time visibility into vehicle location and condition improves utilization, reduces unauthorized use, and prevents costly breakdowns. Better visibility makes it easier for fleet managers to perform at their best. Thankfully, many original equipment manufacturers OEM have built telematics solutions for their vehicles to access important data in real time. Timely access to telematics data helps fleets address many important problems. nbsp Remote monitoring and heavy equipment telematics When fleet managers use telematics to monitor fuel levels remotely, they can track idling and fuel waste, improving fuel economy. Maintenance departments can also benefit from telematics data. Alerts about potential issues help teams address any problems before they lead to costly unplanned downtime. And knowing the exact vehicle location is important when sending a maintenance team out. nbsp With all the telematics solutions on the market, today rsquo s challenge isn rsquo t about producing telematics data. Today rsquo s challenge is about the aggregation of telematics data to drive positive business results. With mixed fleets that typically include multiple makes of heavy equipment, vehicles, and assets, fleet managers have to manage their fleets using multiple OEM solutions. This multi-solution approach is time consuming and confusing for fleet managers. When data points are isolated from one another, that separation inhibits insights, complicates reporting, and gives an incomplete view of operations. nbsp For example, when using multiple telematics solutions for a mixed fleet, you won rsquo t have a single view of where your Komatsu excavator and Caterpillar dozers are located. Now imagine you rsquo re trying to coordinate trucks to transport an excavator and dozers to a new job site. Where are the closest trucks to move the equipment? Has all of the equipment arrived at the site? Managing this from three or four different telematics solutions creates frustration and wastes time. This is further complicated when dispatching a maintenance crew and wanting to make sure they rsquo re prepared for all the equipment on site. Welcome, AEMP 2.0 To address the challenges that businesses are facing, the Association of Equipment Management Professionals AEMP created a telematics standard for earth-moving and construction vehicles. This standard made information from on-board telematics devices available over the internet. nbsp Now known as AEMP 2.0 or ISO 15143-3, the AEMP standard has grown to include nearly 20 data points, including asset ID, location, and engine temperature. With OEM support and alignment, this standardized format allows mixed-fleet owners to manage their heavy equipment telematics data in one place. nbsp Motive uses the AEMP 2.0 API to bring all this information together in one place for fleet managers. As a result, Motive Fleet Dashboard provides fleet managers with a single view into location and asset condition. The dashboard now displays heavy equipment telematics and tracking data from OEMs such as John Deere, Caterpillar, Komatsu, and Volvo. While the Motive Fleet View provides a single view across all assets, the Asset Profile page captures specific information about each asset. ldquo Using two separate solutions to coordinate my trucks and heavy equipment wasn rsquo t efficient, rdquo says Brian Sauers, Fleet Manager, Strike Construction. ldquo With Motive rsquo s AEMP integration, I now have a single source of truth and clear visibility into the location of all my assets. rdquo For fleet managers, having this visibility makes work that much more efficient. Since Motive has done the heavy lifting with OEM integrations, implementing heavy equipment telematics is as simple as clicking ldquo install rdquo on the selected integration in the Motive App Marketplace. Access to more data in one place means more insights, better decision making, and improved profitability. All Motive AEMP integrations can be found in the Motive App Marketplace. If you don rsquo t see the OEM you rsquo re looking for, please let us know so we can add it. Learn more about Motive AEMP integrations in the Motive App Marketplace or in this support article .\n",

            "From hours-of-service rules to Department of Transportation DOT inspections , every year brings more regulations for commercial fleets, complicating IFTA reporting. FMCSA regulations and the hefty fines that come with non-compliance have caused fleets to pay closer attention to their processes and reporting. Fleets that must travel between states as part of interstate commerce know the pain of manual IFTA reporting. After all, they rsquo re required to have more detailed and timely reporting than ever before. Costly slip-ups and manual errors can put them out of service. The good news is that now, with Motive rsquo s new automated IFTA integration for Motive Fleet Card purchases, IFTA reporting just got easier. Customers also get discounts on diesel, maintenance, tires, and other essentials when they use their Motive Card, a zero-fee fleet card . Because Motive Card transaction data is automatically synced and reported in the Motive Fleet Dashboard , fleets can easily track savings and spending, and control how and when their drivers spend. Why IFTA integration matters IFTA is the International Fuel Tax Agreement. For commercial fleets that operate in multiple states and Canadian provinces, IFTA lets businesses use a single fuel tax license to report and pay taxes for fuel their vehicles consume. Without automation, complying with IFTA can be time-consuming and cumbersome. In the past, fleets crossing from state to state had to consolidate fuel receipts manually. Manually keeping track of fuel receipts raises the risk of error or of losing receipts altogether. Add in the fact that manual IFTA reporting often requires fleets to use third-party products and integrations, and an automated process like Motive rsquo s is all the more necessary. nbsp Simplify IFTA reporting with Motive 1. Save time and reduce manual errors Boost productivity and be ready to file by exporting IFTA reports with a single click. Motive helps you automate the paperwork and simplify IFTA filing by importing Motive Card purchases directly to your Fleet Dashboard. That means that with every fuel purchase made on the Motive Card, you rsquo ll get digital reports that automatically track mileage and fuel use by jurisdiction. Details like cardholder ID, vehicle, and fuel type are assigned to each purchase, so you rsquo ll get complete information for every transaction. This automation helps reduce common errors found in manual filings and saves time by cutting the administrative burden of manual receipt reconciliation. 2. Benefits of an all-in-one system Motive Spend Management allows customers to manage their fleet spending and operations in one place. Motive s all-in-one fleet management solution eliminates the need for costly third-party integrations. It makes it easy and convenient to get visibility to unique insights like spend by vehicle, category, and driver. Motive also includes telematics data like fuel and location data to understand where to optimize fleet operations. Another benefit of an all-in-one system is the ability to set up robust spend controls to reduce unauthorized use . If a suspicious purchase does occur, thanks to layering telematics data and transaction data, Motive Sustainability will send fuel theft alerts when a fuel purchase is made, for example, for a vehicle with mismatched fuel type, or vehicle location fuel purchase location mismatch.

            "Every day, your fleet rsquo s drivers spend money on fuel, lodging, and maintenance. While it rsquo s true that you have to spend money to make money, tracking spend can be complex as your fleet grows. You may feel like you rsquo re constantly behind. You may be trying to reconcile schedules with receipts to approve legitimate spending while monitoring for unauthorized charges and use. Add in the inevitable lost or stolen fleet cards or employee churn, and card management becomes even more complicated. If you rsquo re already using a fleet management solution to streamline how your fleet operates, the next logical step is to add spend management . Centralizing fleet operations will further improve productivity while easing your team rsquo s administrative burden. nbsp The Motive Card rsquo s advanced spend control options can help you manage your fleet rsquo s spending. Set and manage limits, activate and deactivate cards, and identify potential fraud mdash all from your Fleet Dashboard. The no-fee Motive Card also provides discounts on fuel, maintenance, and other expenses. Three ways spend controls help fleets save money, improve efficiency, and reduce risk. 1. Reduce fraud and unauthorized spending Unauthorized spending is an area of concern for fleet managers. An estimated 5-10 of a fleet rsquo s annual fuel consumption is lost to theft or misallocation . It rsquo s a small percentage that can quickly add up to big bucks. nbsp Motive rsquo s spend control capabilities provide limits on how your drivers are spending company dollars on company time. Fleet managers can match charges with vehicle location and time, as well as limit spending to designated categories or hours. nbsp For example Limit fuel purchases to the pump only, rather than in-store. Allow fuel expenses while restricting lodging. nbsp Specify that the card is only authorized during certain days or times. nbsp Adjust these parameters in real time, right in the Fleet Dashboard. nbsp 2. Customize spending limits to your fleet rsquo s needs Spend controls allow you to set spending limits by driver group, spend category, or time period. Spending limits help protect your bottom line by restricting excessive spending, but still allow your drivers to get what they need on the road, whether that rsquo s maintenance, lodging, tolls, or meals. nbsp With spend controls, you can reduce unauthorized spending by Limiting transactions to set days or hours. nbsp Setting maximum transaction amounts by day, week, month, or billing cycle. nbsp Restricting spending to designated categories. And if something happens and you need to authorize new times or categories, or increase a transaction limit, you can do so on the fly with immediate effect. If a driver with a 1,000 limit gets into an accident and requires a 3,000 tow, the fleet manager can instantly update their limit within the available credit limit to pay for the tow, then reinstate the 1,000 cap. nbsp 3. Limit risk from lost or stolen fleet cards or employee churn nbsp Even in the smallest fleets, cards get lost or stolen. Employees join and leave. These factors make it harder to keep tabs on which fleet cards should be active and spending. With Motive spend control abilities, you can manage fleet card status from the dashboard whenever you need to Activate a new employee rsquo s card. Freeze a card that rsquo s lost. Deactivate a stolen or departing employee rsquo s card. Changes take effect immediately to reduce the financial risk of unauthorized charges. Read Fleet card basics and benefits . Integrate spend management with your fleet operations With Motive Spend Management, you can streamline your fleet operations even further. Run your fleet rsquo s physical and financial operations out of a single dashboard, and gain full visibility into your drivers, assets, and spending. Detailed reports help you see trends, like who rsquo s spending what and where, without requiring hours of manual work reconciling charges or reimbursing employees rsquo personal cards. nbsp With end-to-end visibility and detailed reports, you rsquo ll have full insight into where and how your fleet rsquo s dollars are spent. Motive Sustainability can even provide a consolidated view of your fleet rsquo s fuel trends, benchmarked across Motive rsquo s entire network of vehicles.

            "Overweight trucks are a problem for fleet and safety managers, truck drivers, and fleet owner operators. This article explains how a vehicle is marked overweight, and explores the potential risks and consequences of operating an overweight truck. nbsp What is an overweight truck? An overweight truck surpasses federally mandated maximum weights for vehicles on the road. The U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration FHA has mandated the following maximum weights for the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways and reasonable access thereto 23 CFR Part 658.17 80,000 pounds gross vehicle weight 20,000 pound single axle weight 34,000 pound tandem axle weight Axle spacing is also a consideration. The FHA states, ldquo to protect bridges, the number and spacing of axles carrying the vehicle load must be calculated. rdquo nbsp To calculate the Federal bridge formula use W 500 LN N-1 12N 36 where W overall gross weight on any group of 2 or more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds. L distance in feet between the extreme of any group of 2 or more consecutive axles, and N number of axles in the group under consideration. Is there a truck overweight allowance? Although the federal government does not issue permits for oversize overweight loads, carriers can apply to states where appropriate. State permitting office telephone numbers are conveniently compiled on a single list from the FHWA . Manage your trucking or logistics operation with Motive. States may also issue permits for nondivisible loads. This happens when separating the cargo into smaller loads or vehicles would compromise the vehicle rsquo s intended function, destroy the load value, or require more than 8 hours to dismantle. Divisible loads may also get load permits based upon historic state grandfather rights or Congressional authorization for a state-specific commodity or route movement at a greater size or weight, according to the FHA. Did you know? Truck weight limits first started in 1918 in Maine, where they were only allowed 18,000 pounds max. What are the risks associated with overweight trucks? The Federal bridge formula illustrates one risk of overweight trucks mdash the fear that a too-heavy truck would undermine a bridge rsquo s stability. The excess weight can also damage the nation rsquo s roads , which are already costly to maintain. Yet, those are not the only risks associated with overweight vehicles. Overweight vehicles are also a safety concern . An overweight truck is going to be more difficult to handle, may go down inclines faster than usual, and will require additional time and space to brake . There is also increased risk of tire blowout, drivers losing steering control while changing lanes or making a sharp, sudden turn, or a vehicle rollover. Who is responsible for an overweight truck? Drivers are seldom the ones to load the truck, plan the route, or deal with load permitting. Still, in most cases, the commercial vehicle driver is held responsible for an overweight truck ticket. Texas , though, recently passed legislation making it possible to prosecute the people who overloaded the truck . You may work for a company that pays fines on the driver rsquo s behalf, but you rsquo ll want to review your contract to know for sure. What happens if your truck is overweight? Drivers of overweight vehicles can face several consequences . In the worst case, the driver of an overweight vehicle could go to jail. And not just for one night, but for months. The driver may also have their commercial driver rsquo s license CDL revoked. Vehicles with excess weight above the permitted maximum can face heavy fines. The driver can be fined as well as the commercial carrier company that sent that vehicle out. There are additional fines for repeat offenders. Any run in with law enforcement can also delay deliveries. If a vehicle is held up at a weigh station and found to be overweight, that truck won rsquo t be going anywhere any time soon. This means carriers need to send another driver to collect that load while communicating with the customer about the change in the delivery schedule. nbsp Overweight truck fines Fines vary from state to state. In California , for instance, a conviction could cost 3,000 or 4,000. Meanwhile, in Texas , the fines start at 100 to 150 for a first offense but can hit 10,000 for a load that is more than 40,000 pounds. nbsp Does an overweight truck ticket go on your record? In most cases, an overweight violation will not go on your record. Still, there are some states e.g., California where the overweight truck ticket can be recorded on your motor vehicle driving record MVR or be counted as a misdemeanor on a driver rsquo s Pre-employment Screening Program PSP record. What happens if a truck is overweight at a weigh station? Drivers better have their overweight permit handy. Otherwise, if the vehicle weighs more than 6,000 pounds over gross weight , expect the government to stop that overweight truck from continuing on its route. There will be fines, possible jail time, and damage to customer relationships since the shipment is delayed. How do I get an overweight truck permit? To get an overweight truck permit, you rsquo ll need to contact the vehicle permitting office for the state where you are driving. If the oversize or overweight cargo is traveling through multiple states, you rsquo ll need to obtain permits for each state along the route. The time it takes to get your permit can vary dramatically depending on the route, load, and vehicle used, so it is good business to plan ahead where you can. nbsp If you rsquo re going to be regularly transporting overweight or oversize loads, in some states you rsquo re able to apply for an annual permit. This can save you the time spent applying over and over again for single trip permits. However, the fee may be prohibitive if you are not taking enough trips to justify the annual cost. How much do overweight truck permits cost? This is going to vary depending on the state. You rsquo ll also want to calculate the price differential of getting a single trip or annual permit. For example, in California, one trip with an overweight load costs 16. An annual permit costs 90. Once you haul more than five overweight loads, you rsquo ve saved money with the annual permit. Top tips to avoid truck overweight fines Using truck scales in your facility before hitting the road is an obvious way to reduce the risk of overweight truck fines. This will let you get an accurate weight before the vehicle is sent out. Don rsquo t forget to factor in fuel weight too. A vehicle with a near empty tank at loading that fills up before the weigh station could exceed the overall weight limit. nbsp Plan routes carefully. Where the vehicle travels once loaded is going to make a difference as to whether it rsquo s overweight or not. Fleet managers can use route optimization, even if it means a longer journey, to avoid routes that require weighing and permits . Educate your employees about the risks. Not just financial, but safety too. You need everyone in your organization aware of the consequences of excess weight to avoid problems on the road or running into difficulties with authorities. WIth Motive rsquo s fleet management solution, it rsquo s also easier to keep commercial drivers safe and optimize routes whether the vehicle is overweight or not. With our ELD devices, management and drivers can communicate easily, optimize drive time, and minimize violations with automated compliance management.

            "Manufacturers, grocers, ecommerce, and construction companies are just some of the many businesses that can fill a trailer with freight. Yet, they may not have their own truck or driver to move it. Instead, they rely on power-only logistics to get their shipment where it needs to go. This article explores power-only trucking and addresses challenges of power-only logistics. What does ldquo power-only rdquo mean in trucking? Power-only trucking is a convenient solution for shippers who own or lease their own trailers but don rsquo t have their own fleet of trucks or drivers. Once they fill the trailer with freight, they need to hire a semi-tractor and driver to get the trailer from point A to point B. The driver, in the semi, provides the ldquo power. rdquo nbsp Different types of shippers will source trucks and drivers, also known as a ldquo power unit rdquo to safely and efficiently move loads. They might have a regular transportation partner they work with or could turn to different power-only trucking companies based on the type of freight, where the freight is located, or where it needs to go. After finding the a semi-tractor and driver, usually a trailer interchange agreement is signed and the shipper rsquo s trailer is secured to the power unit to hit the road. You might also hear of power-only shipping as drop-and-hook shipping , as it refers to the process of hooking a truck to a shipment trailer. What types of companies use power only? Companies that have open deck or dry van commodities generally enjoy the advantages of power-only trucking as their shipments are of a pick-up-and-go nature . It helps that these types of freight can sit in a fully loaded trailer while the power unit is located. Expect companies using power-only trucking to also have ample space available to park their many trailers as they don rsquo t have a pool of tractors or drivers around. That rsquo s not to say perishables or goods that need refrigeration can rsquo t be shipped power only. They can, but the shipper has to have a reefer trailer. Third-party logistics providers offer power-only trucking solutions as part of their flexible offerings to customers. They generally combine power-only capacity with leased trailers or with the shipper rsquo s own trailers. Typical power-only logistics rates Power-only trucking rates are determined by the same factors as other freight rates . These include Supply and demand at point of origin. Type of trailer required. Shipment urgency. Length of haul. Weather conditions . Supply and demand at destination. Any special requirements for shipment. Who rsquo s responsible for the insurance costs in power-only trucking? Two types of insurance generally cover power-only trucking trailer interchange and non-owned trailer . Trailer interchange coverage was created to insure trailers owned by a single company customer. Non-owned trailer coverage insures truck owners pulling trailers for multiple, different businesses. Different companies will have various policies and claim rules, with each customer or truck broker also having different insurance requirements. Expect brokers to require truck owners to have liability and cargo insurance. nbsp Is power-only trucking worth it? Power-only trucking offers shippers several advantages. The pros include Ability to focus on production schedule efficiency. Providers coordinate pickups to get freight moving. Avoids investment in owning a pool of tractors and training drivers . Fuel costs and truck expenses covered by driver or power-only trucking company. Offers flexibility when a facility or warehouse moves, for special shipping projects, or to meet shipping surges. For drivers, there rsquo s also the benefit of taking a power-only load to drive for their full allotted hours of service HOS . They might not have the hours available to budget for loading a trailer but by taking a power-only pickup, they make the most of their available 14 hours. This can, in turn, prove advantageous to the shipper as they may get a better rate from drivers. Power-only trucking can have downsides too. Yes, shippers can store their freight onsite in trailers instead of needing to expand warehouse space. But they rsquo re taking on the responsibility for maintaining and servicing their own trailers. It rsquo s not as expensive as having a full fleet, but the shipper does have to ensure that their trailers are in reliable shape. Otherwise, the driver might refuse the load. Also, as with any type of logistics solution, urgent deliveries can be more costly. With power-only trucking, immediacy is more challenging as a driver needs to be found with an available semi-tractor. nbsp The shipper must also rely on an external provider to make an on-time delivery. Having goods arrive on time is critical to customer satisfaction and business success, so it rsquo s critical to find a reliable partner to offer delivery performance you can count on . There rsquo s also the question of how to return that trailer to its original location. Shippers need to find ways to coordinate freight to avoid having to hire drivers to drop off empty trailers. They may own those trailers, but paying to have them on the road empty is a cost trucking companies want to avoid. Common challenges faced by power-only trucking companies Companies working with power-only freight need to connect with shipments. This can mean building relationships with companies that have their own trailers or using load boards to see available choices. However, focusing on the power-only market does narrow load opportunities. Further, power-only operators surveyed by OverDrive identified additional headaches from this type of shipment. For one thing, competition is fierce, which means making cost revenue calculations before a load is taken by another driver is challenging, and rates are often non-negotiable. Plus, deadhead miles are a greater risk. And speaking of risk, drivers have to trust the trailer owner to provide a well-maintained trailer for hauling. How to optimize your power-only logistics with Motive Motive rsquo s software can help with power-only trucking services. Take the problem of a power-only trailer reaching its destination but then needing to get back to its home base. To avoid paying for a driver to return with an empty trailer, using dispatch and workflow management tools can help ensure you pick up shipments for the trip back to the origin. nbsp If you d like to know more about Motive Dispatch, check out this product brief .

            "Heavy equipment transportation requires proper planning, whether the machinery is hauled across state lines or just down the road. Loading and unloading takes additional care, and there are regulations to comply with when shipping heavy equipment. These top tips for heavy equipment transport can help fleet managers ensure safety and efficiency. What is heavy equipment transportation? Heavy equipment transportation is a subset of the transportation industry dealing with heavy, oversized loads. It involves moving oversize equipment and machinery using trucks and specialized trailers that can haul thousands of pounds or more. nbsp What rsquo s considered heavy equipment? There are many different types of heavy equipment used across industries. Construction , industrial, oil and gas , military, marine, forestry, and agricultural organizations often use heavy equipment transportation. The cargo could include backhoes, excavators, rock trucks, loaders, graders, and more. nbsp The weight of heavy equipment can vary. The federal government classifies cargo as a heavy load when it exceeds 80,000 pounds of gross vehicle weight 20,000 pounds of single axle weight 34,000 pounds of tandem axle weight What are the challenges of heavy equipment transportation? Transporting overweight, oversize equipment presents unique challenges. This section will examine the main challenges fleet managers face. nbsp Safety Attention needs to be paid to securing the equipment. Not only for the safety of the driver hauling the heavy load but also for the safety of others on the road. Safely loading and unloading heavy equipment is another challenge. The labor involved in loading should be qualified and experienced in this particular area of shipping. Rules and Regulations Heavy equipment shipping concerns make this a highly regulated area of transportation. Fleet managers and drivers will need to know the rules and regulations that apply. Not knowing the different regulatory requirements for size and weight can prove costly. The Department of Transportation has jurisdiction over heavy loads on the road, but each state does things differently. Most states require a heavy haul permit, but what qualifies as overweight can vary from one state to the next. The rules about signage, flags, escorts, and accepted transport vehicles can also change depending on size, weight, and route. Further, licensed heavy equipment transportation companies are legally required to carry liability and cargo insurance. Planning logistics Fleet managers must keep safety and regulations in mind when planning the route for a heavy load. There may be restrictions on how equipment is secured to a trailer or when the vehicle can be on the road. The company also needs to have the right vehicles available. A flatbed truck may work in most situations, but don rsquo t be surprised by the need for a heavy-duty, tri-axle lowboy. You rsquo ll need knowledgeable people to load or unload safely. Driver expertise with heavy hauling should factor in too when considering driver hours of service availability. Inexperienced drivers soon recognize that a heavy load changes their vehicle rsquo s handling. Tips for loading and unloading heavy equipment safely Loading and unloading cargo can be dangerous. This is especially true with heavy equipment. nbsp Perform and document a risk assessment Prepare for each heavy haul engagement by developing a thorough process to prepare equipment and personnel for transportation and offloading. There should be a senior manager or supervisor involved in determining risks and what can be done to address them. You rsquo ll also want to document the plan to preemptively address any compliance concerns. Train your employees Shipping a tractor isn rsquo t the same as shifting a pallet. The equipment is likely to be an awkward shape in addition to its weight and size. Heavy hauling is also expensive. Your business doesn rsquo t want to risk anything happening to expensive assets while your people are handling them. Document your processes and ensure that all employees are fully trained in best practices for loading and unloading. Make sure they also have access to all the appropriate personal protective equipment PPE they might need. Do a vehicle pre-inspection Heavy equipment puts a lot of pressure on the vehicle asset. Before loading, verify the truck or trailer is up to the task. Create customized vehicle inspection procedures to inspect tires, lights , brakes , and tie-down points. You should also confirm weight load limits. Clear the loading unloading area Having a clean ramp and trailer area cleared of obstacles makes it easier to load heavy equipment safely. Remove ice, snow, or water from the ramp and trailer bed to ensure smooth movement. Avoid loading and unloading during peak hours or when the dock is heavily occupied to prevent obstacles. Properly secure equipment The manufacturer will often provide instructions and engineering guidelines to secure and stabilize equipment during travel. When tying down the heavy equipment Use heavy-duty chains that are tight enough to prevent movement or shifting, ensuring that equipment remains secure while the vehicle is en route. nbsp Locate proper tie-down points. Using appropriate points prevents equipment damage and helps ensure security. Align chain and hook binder grades to meet your working load limit. Immobilize the wheels of any equipment using wedges, chocks, or cradles. Tips for the safe transportation of heavy equipment Transporting heavy equipment requires extra care. The following best practices can help you prioritize safety. Read the manual Heavy equipment manuals can recommend transport procedures. They often help identify nbsp vulnerable equipment parts and suggest ways to reduce or eliminate damage. Know the route Planning the route in advance helps optimize for factors that could impact driver and equipment safety . Avoiding traffic, construction, or driving in bad weather simplifies transport. Anticipating the route also helps you know which permits are needed along the way. Make advance arrangements to avoid excessive idling or deadhead driving. Drive sensibly Heavy haul drivers know this is a more challenging load to transport. When braking, reversing, turning, changing lanes, or driving uphill or downhill, a vehicle with a heavier load will feel force differently than another truck or trailer. Maintaining a space cushion , driving without distraction, and following posted speed limits are always good choices. But sensible driving practices are all the more important when a heavier load is on the road. Have a response plan Thinking ahead about what you will do if something goes wrong can help you react more efficiently and effectively. For example, flagging and escorts can help enhance safety when encountering an accident on the road. nbsp Risks to consider when shipping heavy equipment You risk costly fines if you don rsquo t meet the specific regulations for load weight, height, or length. Research the rules for each jurisdiction along your route to proactively document and permit where necessary. Weather conditions can also factor into safety on the road. A heavy haul truck handles differently from the start. Add rain, snow, or sleet and extra precautions are needed. nbsp Rough road conditions can also be problematic. Highway potholes could cause equipment to become loose. That poses a danger in transit and upon unloading. How Motive supports heavy equipment hauling and transportation Motive rsquo s all-in-one fleet management solution helps streamline business processes.

            "Oil and gas worksites are typically in remote locations with extreme conditions mdash excessive heat, cold, high winds, harsh blizzards, even hurricanes. Oil and gas sites are often staffed by workers who may go days without seeing another human being. Add the hazards of working with highly flammable materials and you rsquo ve got a recipe for risk. nbsp In 2020, the oil and gas pipeline industry recorded 578 injury incidents . The most common injuries include severe burns, head and brain injuries, broken bones, and amputations. nbsp Motor vehicle crashes cause more than half of all work-related deaths among oil and gas fleet workers. A single fatal on-the-job collision costs employers an estimated 671,000 , with the potential for much higher settlements. The sheer remoteness of oil and gas sites can make injuries worse. Emergency services could be hours away, and remote areas lack landmarks, making it difficult for workers and rescuers to find each other. nbsp Fortunately, technology can help make these remote worksites safer. Motive rsquo s automated coaching can promote safe driver behavior , while remote telematics, cameras, and geofencing can keep solo workers connected with dispatch . Then, if something rsquo s not right, oil and gas fleet managers are alerted instantly. Prevent risky behaviors that can cause accidents Many of the motor vehicle collision deaths in the oil and gas industry result from driver fatigue. After all, workers on remote sites often struggle to get enough sleep. They tend to work long hours, driving long distances on secondary or unpaved roads to reach the next site. nbsp Over time, oil and gas fleet drivers can develop high-risk habits, such as speeding, distracted driving , or not wearing a seatbelt. Motive rsquo s continual dash cam monitoring paired with AI identifies risky behaviors like these. Integrated, automated coaching can prompt drivers to self-correct whenever they exhibit unsafe habits at the wheel. And real-time alerts can remind drivers to slow down, keep their eyes on the road, or pull over to get some rest. Usher Transport reduced accidents annually by 32 after partnering with Motive. Beau Mosley, Executive Vice President of Safety and Human Resources, explains, ldquo Motive allows us to be proactive about changing behavior. Of course, exonerating my drivers is key, but even more important is getting ahead of high-risk behaviors to prevent that crash before it occurs. The technology automatically pinpoints where we should be focusing our time and attention. rdquo Motive AI Dashcams can also provide video evidence for exoneration, helping avoid costly claims when your oil and gas fleet worker wasn rsquo t at fault. Geofence even the most remote sites On many oil and gas sites, vehicles are expected to move regularly. So when a vehicle stays in one place too long, it could be a sign of trouble. nbsp Motive rsquo s geofencing keeps tabs on remote sites by monitoring vehicle movement. Motive can alert dispatch when a vehicle hasn rsquo t moved in a set period of time, prompting you to check in with your worker. If a worker misses a scheduled check-in, Motive can pinpoint exactly where their vehicle is. Geofencing can also alert you when a vehicle goes beyond site boundaries, indicating possible theft. nbsp Stay connected during emergencies Fires and explosions are among the most common threats on oil and gas sites, as static electricity, lightning, and other elements can easily ignite flammable liquids and vapors. nbsp When an emergency strikes, time is of the essence. With Motive, safety managers can receive real-time alerts when a worker has an accident. Managers can also have easy access to captured footage, right in the Motive Fleet Management Dashboard. Visibility like this can save valuable minutes in an emergency when a worker may be injured or dealing with gas exposure or inclement weather. Even if workers are busy evacuating, Motive will continue to collect location and telematics data every one to three seconds . nbsp Learn more about making remote oil and gas sites safer Want to learn how Motive can help make your remote oil and gas fleets and worksites safer?

            "A common business mantra is to always look forward. Yet, when it comes to supply chain sustainability, companies are now taking a closer look at reverse logistics. This often-overlooked part of the product lifecycle is getting more attention in response to market and customer expectations. Understanding this can add a competitive edge for commercial fleets. What does reverse logistics mean? To understand reverse logistics, we should start with forward logistics. Think of a manufacturer taking raw materials, fabricating parts, assembling the product, adding it to inventory, then selling that item to a customer, and finally delivering it to them. That rsquo s all going to take logistics moving from the point of origin to the point of consumption mdash that process is called ldquo forward logistics rdquo . Reverse logistics goes the other way. The flow is from the point of consumption back to the point of origin. The opposite of last-mile delivery , it extends part or product lifecycle by finding ways to return goods, reuse parts, recycle packaging materials, or responsibly dispose of expired products. Any of this recycling, refurbishing, or re-manufacturing is done to recapture value. There rsquo s also a benefit to the environment as the raw materials used at the outset are reclaimed for further use or at least saved from adding to landfill waste. What is the process of reverse logistics Any process extending product lifecycle past the delivery to the end consumer involves reverse logistics. First coined in 1992, the term ldquo reverse logistics rdquo reflects growing attention to maximizing the product lifecycle and thinking always of environmental impact. The boom in ecommerce also prompted greater attention to reverse logistics. Consumers are not only buying more online, but they are also expecting to be able to easily return what they don rsquo t want. Look at Amazon mdash Statista estimates Amazon rsquo s reverse logistics market share at 13 . Retailers need to offer attractive return policies today to meet customer expectations and drive sales. The challenge is finding an efficient and cost-effective way of reversing the logistics from the destination point. nbsp Even when the customer doesn rsquo t initiate a return of a recently purchased item, vendors and manufacturers can look for ways to encourage returns of valuable product elements or reuse of packaging. If you rsquo ve ever traded in your old phone to purchase a new one, the process of sending back that old device for your purchase credit is part of reverse logistics. Reverse logistics has many facets. For example, reusable packaging requires reverse logistic processes. The company must not only deliver the reusable bottles for milk, soda, or beer , but it must also have a system in place to retrieve those bottles for reuse to create a closed-loop system. Reverse logistics examples Imagine the potential value created by any of these examples Customers returning goods Unsold inventory getting returned to partners Packaging reuse Refurbishing goods or products past their prime Providing repairs or maintenance to keep products in top shape Re-manufacturing returned, defective, or otherwise faulty goods Selling overstock or returned items on secondary markets Recycling and disposing of end-of-life goods How reverse logistics can create value According to Statista, ldquo In 2020, the global reverse logistics market was valued at 635.6 billion U.S. dollars. By 2028, the reverse logistics market size is expected to exceed 958 billion U.S. dollars. rdquo There are many ways in which reverse logistics creates value for different interests. Offering reverse logistics support for product buyers or to downstream supply chain members can act as an incentive for sales. It also can help with customer retention and support a good brand image. However, creating value from this approach requires careful attention to inventory volumes and accounting for returns labor e.g., processing, technical support and shipping and storage costs. For manufacturers, reverse logistics can also bring overall cost savings. Say you send back a smartphone when you upgrade to a new device. The company gets access to parts of that device that are costly to replicate or difficult to access due to supply chain difficulties. They might return parts to suppliers, refurbish the device for resale, or re-manufacture the device. Additionally, tracking the reasons for returns and identifying product trends can provide valuable insights for developing future products, choosing supply chain vendors, and anticipating customer behavior. For vendors, finding a secondary market outlet for overstocked or returned goods helps them gain more revenue from their initial investment outlay. nbsp Third-party logistics 3PL providers and commercial fleets benefit from the reverse logistics market as they rsquo re the ones paid to move the stock, whether the flow is forward to point of destination or back to point of origin. nbsp Who rsquo s responsible for reverse logistics management? Generally, the company that originated the product is responsible for management. However, they may choose to outsource the processes to a trusted 3PL or commercial fleet. nbsp The company will have to review, revise, and optimize its return policies and vendor agreements. But, once the cargo has reached its point of destination and reverse logistics is needed, the company can offload that responsibility to a company focused on this area of expertise. This saves the manufacturer or supplier from having to develop its own infrastructure. Instead, it can hire a provider who has invested in the necessary assets to get the job done efficiently. They may have centralized return centers, reverse logistics software or automation technology. What are the advantages of reverse logistics? Reverse logistics offers many advantages . While it may not be immediately intuitive, it can decrease costs. Recycling, reselling, or refurbishing items that would otherwise be a total loss can cut total cost of ownership. Reverse logistic processes can also help the overall system run more efficiently. If a manufacturer can repurpose items, profit margins can benefit. When the business handles reverse logistics for customers, offering refunds and providing return shipping, customer experience improves. This can build brand loyalty and encourage people to buy more from that business in the future. These processes also reduce waste. For instance, take fresh food delivered to its destination yet not purchased. If that food is not repurposed before it spoils, it could become part of the 30 percent of food in U.S. grocery stores that gets thrown away. Having a reverse logistics process in place can avoid that outcome. Eliminating waste can also lower environmental impact. Along with providing incentives for recycling packaging or promoting returns instead of letting things end up in the landfill, those in charge of reverse logistics look to centralize return locations, establish local repair centers, and optimize shipping to avoid unnecessary transportation costs. nbsp What are the disadvantages of reverse logistics? Coordinating reverse logistics is not simple. Multiple parties can be involved in the coordination of an item going back from the consumer to a distribution center and then on to the next stage. Businesses need to have processes in place to verify, inspect, and test products. They may also need to repair and repackage the items, which requires labor and quality assurance. Manufacturers need to track a lot of information along the way in reverse logistics. They may need to keep customers up-to-date on the status of returns, work with commercial fleets to get the items from point A to point B, handle restocking, or partner with companies that can recycle, refurbish, or resell the items. Preventing revenue loss also requires close accounting for costs throughout the process. nbsp At the same time, customer demand for more convenient reverse logistics processes continues to grow. This puts added pressure on businesses to make returns fast and inexpensive, or for manufacturers to get repairs done quickly. Meanwhile, customers lack any real knowledge of what rsquo s involved in meeting the rising demand. What to look for in reverse logistics software Reverse logistics is just one area of the supply chain, but technology providers have recognized the challenges and opportunities. It is possible today to find software that helps automate some of the many processes involved. Look for software with the following features. Real-time tracking is essential. Throughout the reverse logistics process, many parties will want to know where that item is located. Customers want to track the progress of their return. Recipients want to plan for return arrival or anticipate the actions they will take to reduce losses. Having a software that provides regular communication with customers and tracks transportation improves refund, credit, or product exchange coordination. nbsp Look for a reverse logistics software that helps analyze costs to evaluate best options and better understand bottom line impact. Associated costs could include Transportation expenses to deliver items, to send them back, and in case of exchange, to redeliver Repair costs nbsp Labor payments for processing returns, quality testing, restocking, etc. Holding costs in case of restocking A software that supports effective returns management can help decision makers determine the most cost-effective approach to take. Any automation of processes can also help expedite the progress of goods. With support for streamlining workflows, the entire process can be enhanced for improved customer satisfaction and faster value creation. Your ability to generate custom reports could also be a consideration. The software you invest in should help you to collect and analyze your reverse logistics data. This can help you with customer service, inventory adjustment, quality control, and more.

            "If it rsquo s your business to transfer freight, understanding the nuances between the different types of trailers available to move goods is essential. No trailer is a one-size-fits-all solution, so when choosing the right trailer for your freight, you need to consider things like how heavy your goods are, what temperatures they need to be stored in, and the most cost-effective solution for your business. When considering the pros and cons of going with a reefer trailer or a dry van, it rsquo s less of a consideration of which trailer is better than the other, but which is best suited for the type of cargo you rsquo ll be transporting. Already have the right trailers for your needs? Contact Motive Sales to discuss fleet management tools. The difference between dry van and reefer trucks trailers The difference between reefer and dry van trailers is in the type of cargo they are each built to carry. Dry van trailers are the most common type of trailers operating in America. Dry vans typically ship every-day-use items. Dry vans are typically used for items on pallets, in boxes, or that can be carried loose in a box enclosure. nbsp The biggest difference between dry van and reefer trailers is that reefer trailers are refrigerated trailers with temperature-controlled units built into them. Reefer trailers are used for items that require a temperature-controlled environment and risk spoiling or becoming ruined if not kept at a specific temperature. Items like produce, pharmaceuticals, and candles are transported using reefer trailers. Reefer vs dry van weight When comparing a dry van vs reefer trailer, the weight capacity of each should be taken into consideration to ensure it suits the freight you rsquo ll be carrying. Dry vans can carry up to 45,000 pounds in cargo. Reefer trailers are designed to be as strong and light as possible so you can haul maximum cold chain product without exceeding the federal GVWR 80,000 pounds for dual axles or 90,000 pounds if you have a third axle . nbsp The GVWR counts more than just the weight in the trailer. This combined weight includes The truck The driver Personal property Truck fuel Reefer fuel The trailer Product in the trailer To illustrate, check out this short use case. You rsquo re driving a truck that weighs 14,000 pounds including yourself, your personal property, and fuel , and your trailer weighs 13,000 pounds. You have a standard two-axle trailer, which means you can legally weigh 80,000 pounds. The difference between the GVWR and your current weight is 53,000 pounds, so that rsquo s how much cold chain freight you can carry. Reefer vs dry van dimensions The dimensions of reefer vs dry van trailers are another consideration when deciding which to choose to haul your freight. The most typical dry van dimensions are 53 rsquo Trailers are 53 rsquo x 8 rsquo 6 rdquo x 8 rsquo 6 rdquo and can carry as many as 26 pallets. 48 rsquo Trailers are 48 rsquo x 8 rsquo 5 rdquo x 13 rsquo 6 rdquo and can carry up to 24 pallets. 28 rsquo Trailers are 28 rsquo x 8 rsquo x 9 rsquo and can carry 22,500 pounds and 14 pallets. Box Trucks are 24 rsquo x 8 rsquo x 6 rsquo and can carry freight weighing up to 10,000 pounds. nbsp Standard reefer trailer dimensions The length of reefer trailers ranges from 48 to 53 feet. The external width of a reefer is 8 feet and 6 inches. The internal width of a reefer is 8 feet and 1.5 inches. nbsp The external height is 13 feet and 6 inches high on a 46.5-inch fifth wheel. The internal height is about 8 feet and 7 inches with a door height of 9 feet and 2 inches. Reefer vs dry van rates Load rates always vary depending on market conditions, so it rsquo s important to stay informed on reefer vs dry van rates so you know how prices will affect your bottom line. As of October 2022, DAT Freight amp Analytics reports dry van linehaul rates as being between 1.75 and 2.00 mile. To elaborate on market conditions, DAT explains, ldquo Even though dry van spot rates are 0.62 mile lower than the last year, they are still 0.22 mile higher than the average of the prior four pre-pandemic years for the beginning of October. rdquo As for reefer van rates in October 2022 , DAT reports them being between 2.00 and 2.25 mile, and have been mostly flat, ldquo remaining at a national average of just under 2.19 mile, 0.71 mile lower than the previous year. Reefer spot rates have decreased by 31 since the start of the year and at the start of October, are just 0.07 higher than this time in 2018. rdquo Can you use a reefer as a dry van? One of the bigger advantages of reefer trailers is their versatility, since you can use them to carry both refrigerated and non-refrigerated loads. nbsp While it rsquo s true that operating reefer trailers can be more expensive than dry vans, having one trailer that can haul both dry and refrigerated goods could end up being a more economical solution than purchasing more than one trailer to move different types of goods. Dry van or reefer? Which should you choose? There rsquo s no single answer to the question regarding dry van vs reefer. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each when choosing which type of trailer is best for you. Reefer trailer advantages Perishable goods like food and medicine are always in demand. You can use reefers to haul dry and refrigerated items. Reefer trailers are temperature-controlled and hazmat compatible. nbsp Reefer trailer disadvantages Reefers can be more expensive to operate and maintain than dry vans. Potential malfunctions to refrigeration units could make the risk of damaged loads greater. Loading and unloading at docks can take longer. Dry van advantages Dry vans come in many different sizes to suit various types of shipping needs. They rsquo re easier to load and unload, with less equipment to manage. They rsquo re typically cheaper to operate than reefer trailers. Dry van disadvantages Dry vans usually have wooden floors that can be more susceptible to damage. They cannot carry temperature-sensitive materials. nbsp They rsquo re not protected from weather conditions like extreme heat or freezing temperatures. Reefer vs dry van for owner operators When owner operators are considering the question of reefer vs dry van, they should consider the same advantages and disadvantages above. Ask yourself questions like Will I be carrying cargo that needs to be temperature controlled? What rsquo s my budget for carrying cargo? Will I be driving in extremely hot or extremely cold weather? What are the regulations when it comes to the conditions in which my cargo needs to be transported? Powerful technology for all fleet operators Whether you are an owner operator or run a fleet of dry vans or reefer trailers, Motive can help you thrive. With a suite of AI-powered applications, Motive helps you automate tracking and telematics, driver safety, compliance, maintenance, spend management, reefer monitoring, cold chain management, and much more. nbsp Contact Motive Sales to discuss the right fleet management tools for your needs.\n",

            "Remember when a customer would wait seven to 10 days for delivery without complaint? Those days are gone, thanks to the immediate results technology is able to provide. Customer demand for ever-faster delivery is an ongoing challenge in transportation logistics. To remain competitive, commercial fleets must do their part to improve shipping transit time. What is shipping transit time? Transit time is the amount of time it takes for freight to travel from point A to point B. Typically measured in hours or days, transit time is impacted by Transportation availability Distance traveled Routing Freight rate paid Schedule reliability Time taken to load or unload cargo Equipment breakdown Labor problems Why is delivery speed important? Speed of delivery can determine whether a business can meet its commitment to customers. A business awaiting raw materials, finished goods, or parts from suppliers expects the delivery within the stated transit time to be able to move forward with its processes. Meanwhile, consumers who can rsquo t rely on a promised delivery speed are more likely to abandon a brand. Does the type of freight affect shipping transit time? Yes, the type of freight, like so many other factors, can affect delivery speed. So plan accordingly when forecasting speed of delivery. Freight could require permitting If cargo has to clear customs before moving on to its destination, that can slow the speed of delivery. When crossing state borders, freight permits may be required for loads that are heavier or larger than the legal limits. Transporting hazardous materials also calls for drivers to display placards on their vehicles that correctly identify the classification of the cargo. Any errors or discrepancies could further delay the delivery when permit documentation is needed. nbsp Freight could require escorts Depending on the cargo, delivery speed could also be impacted by the need for escorts. Oversized or heavy-haul loads, and certain categories of hazardous cargo and explosives, require additional vehicles on the road. Arranging for an escort to ensure safe travel for the truck and its cargo, and to protect other motorists on the road, can impact the delivery timeline. nbsp Reefers require proof of temperature upon delivery nbsp Cold chain logistics refrigeration units must demonstrate that temperature consistency was maintained from pickup to dropoff. Relying on manual processes to analyze the temperature logs can slow delivery speed. On the other hand, when reefers have the ability to pull their own temperature monitoring reports upon delivery, it can save time and improve customer satisfaction. What do customers value more, shipping transit time or cost? In Shopify rsquo s 2022 Future of Commerce research , 75 of shoppers favored fast, free shipping above all else. Free shipping had a ldquo significant rdquo or ldquo very significant rdquo influence on a majority of shoppers rsquo purchasing decisions. Further, in a Shopify study of consumer behavior, 69.7 of customers said they would be less likely to shop with a retailer again if the delivery experienced delays. How does shipping transit time affect customer satisfaction? With rising expectations for next-day or same-day deliveries, shipping transit time has a measurable impact on customer satisfaction. Shopify found that being able to see an estimated delivery timeline was a top priority for 2022 customers. Additionally, 32 of ecommerce customers globally would abandon carts if they can rsquo t get fast, free, on-time delivery. In the United States, that number goes up to 37 . Tips to reduce your shipping transit time When it comes to reducing shipping transit time, you rsquo ll notice a common theme. The more you know, the more efficient you can be. Best practices for improving delivery speed rely on real-time visibility, constant contact, and seamless oversight across multiple areas of operations. 1. Optimize delivery routes Finding the most time- and cost-efficient routes to take when driving between stops can be challenging for fleet managers. Fleet management software helps maximize route efficiency by considering the many variables more quickly and accurately than humans can do. Considering customer time windows, vehicle capacity, traffic congestion, weather, and distance between stops, for example, the software helps determine the most efficient routes between each designated stop. Route optimization that also takes into consideration real-time and historical data, vehicle safety data, and the best available driver for that route can positively impact delivery speed as well. 2. Modify routes in real time Invest in fleet management software that offers ongoing tracking of your drivers and trucks. By monitoring current location and driver status, you gain the flexibility to ensure smoother operations. Avoid last-minute challenges and adapt quickly with real-time notifications that enable you to revisit routes on the fly. 3. Monitor both forward and reverse logistics Forward logistics covers the supply chain processes that deliver the product from manufacturer to customer. Reverse logistics is the name given to processes that turn the flow from the destination back to the point of origin. This could be via returns, recycling, reusing parts, or responsible disposal by the manufacturer. nbsp Many businesses have well-established forward logistics processes, yet their reverse logistics systems are less developed. Effective tracking of both these logistics flows can help reduce shipping transit time by revealing greater process inefficiencies. By monitoring reverse logistics inflow as well, companies can better plan for demand surges and source, purchase, or lease transportation ahead of time. This avoids shifting resources unexpectedly from forward logistics, which can slow shipping transit times. Improve shipping transit time with Motive Fleet management software can provide a centralized view of the many levers you can pull to improve delivery speed. Positively impact the operations, efficiency, and production of your commercial fleet with route optimization . nbsp With GPS asset tracking , you can also modify routes in real time as needed.

            "Everybody worries about fleet fuel costs, especially as diesel prices surge. After all, fuel constitutes nearly half of a fleet rsquo s operating expenses . Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to save on fuel and improve your fleet rsquo s fuel economy. nbsp How to save on fleet fuel costs Most strategies to reduce fleet fuel costs and increase efficiency fall into the following four categories. 1. Fleet upgrades Making changes to your fleet can be the most impactful way to cut fleet fuel costs and consumption, but this approach can be expensive. If you rsquo re ready to replace your combustion engine vehicles with a fleet of EVs, you can improve your fuel economy dramatically, but few fleets can afford to do that. Other approaches, including aftermarket aerodynamic components, low-rolling resistance tires, and engine accessories can improve fuel economy as well, but such capital expenditures can be steep at a time when fleets are trying to save. 2. Vehicle maintenance Strategies such as ensuring correct tire pressure, inspecting vehicles regularly, optimizing maintenance schedules, and getting regular engine tune-ups have been proven to improve fuel economy as well. However, you rsquo re likely doing many of these things already, and their direct impact on fuel mileage is more modest than what many fleets need today. nbsp Keep vehicles running smoothly with Motive Maintenance. 3. Driving behavior Driving habits can make a big impact on fuel economy. Safe, efficient drivers can account for up to 20 reduction in fleet fuel costs. Driving behaviors such as idling, speeding, and harsh acceleration tend to burn the most fuel. Fortunately, you can improve fleet fuel economy by coaching drivers to be mindful of fuel-wasting habits. nbsp Tools such as the Motive AI Dashcam and Vehicle Gateway can provide detailed insights into the driving behaviors and telematics data of your fleet. The Vehicle Gateway captures telematics data and the AI Dashcam alerts drivers in real time of poor driving behavior. Using the collected telematics data, Motive can coach drivers to become more aware of fuel-wasting habits like idling, harsh acceleration, and speeding. When these behaviors occur, Motive sends automated coaching tips to drivers directly through the Motive Driver App . Drivers can then see what happened and get timely instructions on how to improve. nbsp Telematics, coaching, and fleet fuel cost Telematics data from the Motive Vehicle Gateway feeds into the Fleet Dashboard where you can see your fleet rsquo s fuel economy and benchmark your fleet rsquo s fuel performance against Motive rsquo s network of over 700k vehicles. See your fleet history and trends on idling, MPG, and more to identify specific areas for improvement. You can also proactively reduce fuel-wasting behaviors like setting up idling alerts to get notified of idling in real time. A recent Motive study on fuel ROI found that fleets using fuel insights together with driver coaching achieve up to 13 greater fuel economy than other fleets. Drivers in these fleets also displayed better driving quality, resulting in a whopping 79 drop in hard acceleration, a 40 reduction of hard braking, and 20 less vehicle idling time. nbsp 4. Fleet cards The payment method your drivers use to pay for fuel won rsquo t improve your fuel economy, but it can be a very compelling way to reduce fleet fuel costs. After all, the cost of fuel is one of the highest cost factors for most fleets today. The Motive Card is a fleet card with impressive savings , including an average of over 0.20 per gallon at partner fuel stations such as Love s, TA, and Road Ranger. It rsquo s accepted everywhere Mastercard is accepted and those discounts can add up to some impressive savings. The Motive Card also enables fleet managers to control who can use, and how they use their fleet cards, a compelling benefit. Using the Motive Spend Management application that rsquo s seamlessly integrated into the Motive Fleet Dashboard, you can manage your spend where you rsquo re already managing your fleet, while automating IFTA reporting, and identifying unauthorized use and fuel theft mdash a significant way to reduce fuel costs . If you don rsquo t have this fleet card yet, apply for the Motive Card now . nbsp Clearly, small improvements in your fleet management can make a big impact on your bottom line, reducing your overall fleet fuel costs.\n",

            "The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association FMCSA rsquo s updated its nbsp personal conveyance nbsp rules to add more flexibility for commercial drivers. Informed by industry feedback on changes first proposed in 2017, the guidelines clarify and expand the use of the off-duty driving status. This article outlines what you need to know to understand the personal conveyance limit. What is personal conveyance? nbsp Personal conveyance is the term the FMCSA applies to ldquo the movement of a commercial motor vehicle CMV for personal use while off-duty. rdquo Personal conveyance would fall under the off-duty hours-of-s ervice HOS a driver documents, along with on-duty not driving , driving , or sleeper berth 49 CFR 395.8 . When a driver records time for personal conveyance, they must be relieved of work and all responsibility for performing work by the motor carrier. Of course, they must still responsibly operate the CMV, but there is no commercial benefit for the motor carrier from the movement of the CMV. What are the personal conveyance rules? Before the electronic logging device ELD rule was established in December 2015, designating drive time as personal conveyance could be documented by hand. With the introduction of ELDs, the method of recording personal conveyance changed. This led to a need for greater clarity on the rules. FMCSA personal conveyance rules were modified to give drivers the flexibility to locate and obtain adequate rest while in personal conveyance status. Instead of focusing on whether the vehicle is laden or unladen, the agency now focuses on the purpose behind the driver rsquo s operation of the CMV while off-duty. Specifically, the modification lets drivers drive off-duty, in personal conveyance, with a laden truck. In describing the changes, the FMCSA noted there are ldquo approximately 2.3 million straight trucks that operate in interstate commerce. rdquo Under the previous personal conveyance rules, if a driver was held up by loading or unloading of cargo, operating in the correct off-duty status was complicated because they were still laden. The revised guidance allows laden vehicles, under specific circumstances, to be driven as a personal conveyance. Special driving status The FMCSA guidance permits drivers to use their truck when off-duty for personal conveyance needs such as Traveling from a driver rsquo s lodging such as a motel or truck stop to restaurants and entertainment facilities. Commuting between the driver rsquo s terminal and residence, between trailer-drop lots and the driver rsquo s residence, and between work sites and the driver rsquo s residence. nbsp Traveling to a nearby, safe location to obtain required rest after loading or unloading. nbsp Moving a CMV at the request of a safety official during the driver rsquo s off-duty time. Transporting personal property while off-duty. Learn how to use Motive to enable or disable a driver for personal conveyance or yard move in our Help Center. How does personal conveyance impact on-duty hours? Personal conveyance is an off-duty status. As a result, there are no impacts to the 11- or 14-hour limitations for truck drivers. Is personal conveyance mandatory? Personal conveyance isn rsquo t mandatory. Carriers can decide to configure ELDs to allow drivers to log personal conveyance, but they aren rsquo t required to. Personal conveyance limits The personal conveyance rules can rsquo t be used however the driver wants, though. The FMCSA identifies several things that don rsquo t qualify as personal conveyance, including Movement of a vehicle to enhance operational readiness, such as moving closer to a pickup location or drop-off point. Driving bobtail or with an empty trailer to a location to pick up another load. Driving an unloaded truck to a designated parking area after being unloaded. Repositioning a CMV or trailer in the direction of the motor carrier. Transporting a CMV to a facility to have vehicle maintenance performed. Traveling to a motor carrier rsquo s terminal after loading or unloading from a shipper or a receiver. Carriers might impose limits or establish policies for their fleets or drivers, but there are no specific time or distance personal conveyance limits for the U.S. In Canada , commercial drivers are limited to 75 kilometers 46.6 miles per day. The 75-kilometer distance refers to the actual distance traveled, not the radial distance. Learn how to use personal conveyance in this tutorial. How Motive can help simplify FMCSA personal conveyance compliance Understanding the FMCSA rsquo s personal conveyance rules and ensuring drivers are always compliant with HOS regulations can help your company avoid violations and potential fines. FMCSA-registered and certified in Canada, the Motive ELD ensures compliance across North America. nbsp Drivers can use the Motive Driver App nbsp on their mobile devices to record personal conveyance movement.

            "After the supply chain crisis of 2021, commercial fleets were looking for a reprieve in 2022. They didn rsquo t get one. Fleets struggled with a shortage of people, materials, and equipment, which meant they had to go heavy on innovation. Here rsquo s a look at the most impactful events of the year mdash and how commercial transportation companies handled it all. With record fuel prices, fleets turned to technology to to become more efficient Businesses and operators won rsquo t soon forget the summer of 2022, when fleet managers thought diesel prices couldn rsquo t get any higher . The price of diesel skyrocketed 55 between January and June 2022, peaking at 5.57 a gallon, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics . A lack of U.S. refining capacity, and the export of more than 1 million gallons of diesel a day to Latin America and Europe , led to the record rise in fuel costs as countries sought alternatives to Russian oil. nbsp When the American Transportation Research Institute ATRI released its 18th Annual Top Industry Issues report in October, fuel prices topped the list. As record diesel costs cut into companies rsquo profit margins, fleets turned to fleet fuel management to reduce consumption any way they could. Automated fuel monitoring , anti-idling devices, more efficient routing , and spend management tools were all in demand as commercial transportation businesses looked to improve efficiency and cut costs. nbsp Learn more For fuel-saving tips from the experts, check out our on-demand webinar Cutting Fuel Costs With the Help of Technology . Supply chain issues shifted from the coast to the heartland It was another rough year for the supply chain as backups shifted from coastal ports to inland warehouses. ldquo The struggle for shipping capacity that has been a hallmark of pandemic-era snarled supply chains is shifting inland, rdquo the Wall Street Journal wrote in August. Equipment shortages stalled the movement of goods, and inflation led to a spike in costs. The lack of available parts caused fleets to hold onto equipment longer. In construction, non-residential building costs jumped 12.6 year-over-year , with most materials posting double-digit increases. ldquo Costs are rising faster than the rates contractors charge for projects, and it rsquo s eating into their profit margins, rdquo says Brian Turmail, Vice President, Public Affairs amp Strategic Initiatives, for Associated General Contractors of America AGC . Manufacturing shutdowns in China, ongoing labor shortages , and low water levels on the Mississippi River exacerbated supply chain slowdowns , impeding the commercial transportation of important building materials. ldquo Supply chain flow has been inconsistent, availability has been erratic, and everything has gotten more expensive, rdquo Turmail said. ldquo What we rsquo re learning is that it rsquo s easy to shut down the global economy during a pandemic, and it rsquo s really hard to gear it back up. rdquo Fleets used AI-based tools to coach and retain workers For another year, the labor shortage rocked businesses from one end of the physical economy to the other. October data released by American Trucking Associations ATA shows the driver shortage improved by a mere 3,000 drivers . That means the trucking industry still needs to hire 78,000 drivers to keep up with demand. In construction, the Associated Builders and Contractors ABC put the workforce shortage at 650,000, and economist Anirban Basu called the labor shortage ldquo the most acute challenge facing the construction industry. rdquo nbsp Companies turned to AI-based tools for help, seeing the wisdom in a ldquo train and retain rdquo approach. After all, if you can rsquo t hire workers, develop the ones you have. Forbes spotted the AI coaching trend as early as February, saying, ldquo AI is poised to revolutionize how we coach employees. rdquo The Motive AI Dashcam proved its value as fleets used it to develop safer driving habits in employees. Commercial transportation managers started to see that while hiring is a challenge, training and retaining workers through video-based coaching is a lot easier. nbsp Digital transformation accelerated Fleets ramped up their digital investments to improve efficiency, safety, and overall performance . With a recession looming, saving time and money was the name of the game. Fleets that used the pandemic to invest in foundational tools made the move to more advanced solutions, seeking to work faster, smarter, and safer than before. nbsp Automation, the Internet of Things IoT , cloud-based software, and AI-based tools were in demand as fleets saw a strong return on their investment and looked to their peers for inspiration. Across the physical economy, digital transformation empowered businesses to achieve more with less. They did it through automated compliance management , better routing, AI dash cams, and real-time feedback. Companies continued to support remote and hybrid work environments , relying on videoconferencing and cloud-based storage to collaborate. The U.S. Supreme Court ensured that the AB5 law would go into effect The U.S. Supreme Court rsquo s decision not to take up the case of the California Trucking Association v. Bonta rippled across the transportation industry, jeopardizing the future of the independent contractor model as the trucking industry has known it. With an estimated 70,000 owner-operators in the state of California , these drivers are the lifeblood of trucking fleets. The California Trucking Association challenged the AB5 law in court, but the bid failed, allowing the state of California to classify independent contractors as employees instead of contractors. For leased owner-operators and the fleets who rely on them, the law could have costly ramifications. Once the issue winds its way through the appeals process, that is. nbsp There was a close link between driver behavior and future crashes nbsp In the fall of 2022, the American Transportation Research Institute released a report that showed high-risk driving habits reliably predict future collisions. ldquo Having a previous crash increased a truck driver rsquo s probability of having another one by 113 , which is 28.4 higher than the previous ATRI reports, rdquo wrote Fleet Owner about the findings. nbsp Meanwhile, 2022 data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed an increase in roadway deaths during the first half of the year. The rise continued a trend from 2021, when motor vehicle crashes rose by 10.5 . In crashes involving a large truck, fatalities jumped by 13 , the largest annual percentage increase in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System rsquo s history. Together, these findings drive home the need to coach commercial transportation drivers on unsafe behaviors that put them at risk. nbsp Merger and acquisition activity was strong In 2022, companies teamed up to weather the economic storm and capture more market share. In its mid-year outlook for deals , PriceWaterhouse Coopers PwC addressed M amp A trends by sector. In engineering and construction E amp C , the ldquo scorching pace rdquo of M amp A activity to start the year petered off in response to economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Nonetheless, PwC rsquo s outlook for E amp C deals remains strong, ldquo driven by continued availability of capital and buoyed by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. rdquo nbsp In transportation and logistics , deals increased in value through the summer, and fleets looked to technology to do more with less. The most ldquo attractive rdquo investment opportunities focused on real-time solutions that conserve fuel, improve routing, and automate operations, and PwC expects to see more of the same in 2023. ldquo Investors will seek technology-driven solutions to improve efficiencies and manage costs, especially in today rsquo s inflationary economic environment, rdquo they said. nbsp Global oil and gas exploration fell nearly 60 International oil and gas exploration plummeted nearly 60 in 2022 , leading to record-high fuel costs and months of financial instability for commercial fleets in every sector of the economy. As the Biden administration remains committed to combating global warming, U.S. leaders are walking a fine line on oil-related issues. nbsp Rystad Energy reports that only 44 global lease rounds are expected to take place this year. That rsquo s 14 fewer than in 2021 and the fewest since 2000. Complicating matters, a coalition of oil-producing nations led by Russia and Saudi Arabia announced in October it will cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day . The move was largely viewed as a reproach to President Biden mdash one that could raise global fuel prices, worsen the risk of a recession, and bolster Russia in its war with Ukraine. But hey, let rsquo s stay positive. Hurricane Ian ravaged Florida, and technology is driving a rapid rebuilding effort When Ian made landfall on Florida rsquo s Gulf Coast as a Category 4 storm, it flooded whole counties and ravaged communities. The full extent of hurricane damage won rsquo t be known for months, but early estimates put Ian among the top 10 costliest storms in U.S. history mdash second only to Hurricane Katrina. With a total financial impact ranging from 65 billion to 120 billion , ldquo Ian left a devastating impact on Florida rsquo s manufacturing, agriculture, and distribution sectors, rdquo Wealthmanagement.com writes. nbsp The good news is, technology is playing a major role in repairing bridges and restoring communities. In Sanibel, thanks to the help of drones and other tech, repairs were completed 12 days ahead of schedule . ldquo Drones made it easier to track progress and do quantity checks as fill was brought in to repair areas that had been washed away, rdquo Construction Dive reported. Diversity, equity, and inclusion DEI efforts picked up More businesses put DEI initiatives into action this year, and nowhere did DEI take a bigger leap than in construction. After high-profile threats appeared on construction jobsites, leaders made diversity, equity, and inclusion their mission. The second annual Construction Inclusion Week proved it as more than 2,300 companies participated, doubling last year rsquo s attendance. The 2022 Supply Chain DEI Survey from Gartner and the Association for Supply Chain Management revealed that 75 of supply chain organizations now consider ethnicity and race in their DEI strategies, up from 62 in 2021. In the last year, the percentage of companies with no DEI focus was nearly halved, from 21 to 11 . nbsp Meanwhile, the American Trucking Associations ATA announced an award recognizing trucking fleets committed to inclusion. ldquo It rsquo s one thing to talk about improving diversity, but the Change Leader Award identifies industry leaders who are walking the walk every day, rdquo ATA President Chris Spear said in introducing the award. The infrastructure bill also gave rise to the Women of Trucking Advisory Board , on a quest to elevate women in the industry.

            "When managing delivery operations, it rsquo s important to streamline your processes and improve efficiency. And today, the stakes are higher than ever. Delivery is big business, with 68,000 couriers and messengers , and 1.3 million delivery drivers employed in the United States . With millions of packages delivered every day, the number of deliveries to manage and routes to choose from can become overwhelming. Companies and drivers want a delivery route that rsquo s both time efficient and cost effective. Route management technology is an invaluable tool when it comes to finding the quickest, most economical routes. nbsp What is route management? Route management is a part of delivery operations that involves finding the most efficient routes for vehicles to follow when delivering goods. This involves activities such as Keeping track of how often common routes are congested, and at what times. Planning delivery routes according to known efficiencies. nbsp Monitoring conditions of regular routes, and keeping up with alerts like roadwork and other hazards. Making sure drivers can find the best alternative routes if preferred routes are unavailable. Ensuring on-time delivery for customers. Keeping drivers safe by making sure the safest routes are taken. Why is route management important? Route management is important for companies that manage delivery operations because it helps with things like collecting traffic and location data, making frequent routes more efficient, and keeping track of delivery drivers with GPS. With the help of live traffic updates, delivery route management tools automatically reroute drivers to avoid traffic, which saves time and money. Satellite signals in route planning technology determine a vehicle rsquo s exact location, how many other vehicles are on the road, and how much oncoming traffic there is. Route planning also involves maintaining a complete view of where drivers and vehicles are at all times. This is important because it allows companies to see which drivers are near pickups and dropoffs, and which have the most availability, improving the speed of dispatches. Benefits of using a route management system. Effective route management systems allow you to manage your dispatch and delivery operations with ease. They help you organize your routes and optimize your operations for consistent, on-time deliveries. Other benefits include Optimized routes .

            "GPS fleet tracking is an increasingly common technology for commercial fleets. Yet you can do even more to improve productivity and gain efficiency by pairing your GPS tracking data with geofencing tools. Read on to learn about fleet geofencing and its advantages and applications. nbsp What is fleet geofencing? Geofencing is a digital solution in which you set up a virtual perimeter around a specific location of your choice or a point of interest. Your virtual boundary can pinpoint a zone as narrow as a single-lane street or as vast as a whole country. You can also set a boundary around an entire highway. Fleet geofencing puts this into practice for fleet vehicles. Taking advantage of GPS fleet tracking , you can set up real-time notifications letting you know when assets enter or exit the boundaries of the geofenced perimeter. Using WiFi, cellular data, GPS, or RFID, the geofencing software will use real-time data about your assets to trigger pre-programmed responses. Get real-time visibility with Motive Tracking amp Telematics. Advantages of fleet geofencing nbsp Fleet geofencing can help improve productivity and streamline operations. There are many ways it can make life easier for drivers and fleet managers Helps prevent cargo theft. Take quick action if an asset moves outside of its geofence boundaries Ensures driver safety. Use geofences to identify high-risk locations and be more attentive to your drivers as they pass through those regions. Reduces administrative burden. Geofencing and GPS fleet tracking give administrators real-time access to asset location. Provides real-time alerts. Administrators can automate alerts notifying them whenever an asset enters or leaves a virtual parameter, such as a driver entering or leaving a job site. Cuts detention time. With geofence alerts notifying you of when a vehicle enters and exits a facility you can quickly identify shippers and receivers that frequently detain your drivers. How does fleet geofencing work? Geofencing is easy to use with your fleet management software. First you find your location on a map. Then, you draw the geofence rsquo s shape and set the boundaries for your virtual perimeter. nbsp In configuring a geofence, you can set up entry and exit triggers that will use WiFi, cellular data, GPS, or RFID data to alert you to activities within the chosen zone. For example, you might set up an alert to let you know if a bulldozer leaves its designated zone at a construction job site. You can also set alerts by driver, vehicle, asset, or group. nbsp Learn more about creating and viewing geofence alerts in our Help Center. nbsp Industry applications of fleet geofencing Various industries can benefit from geofencing. This section explores some of the specific advantages in several unique industry environments. Combatting equipment theft Construction site thefts are all too common. Even the theft of one loader from a job can be costly. Yet geofencing paired with GPS asset tracking can ensure continuous monitoring of equipment, even on remote sites. With a geofence alert established, you can be alerted any time an asset is unexpectedly moved or used. nbsp With the geofence alerts telling you when equipment enters or exits a site you can also improve cycle times and utilization. With real-time visibility, managers no longer have to call to ask when a truck is due. As Chad Goodrich, service administrator for nbsp Equipment Corporation of America , nbsp explains, ldquo Now we can see all our drivers, vehicles, and equipment in one place mdash saving us time from checking files or multiple calls. rdquo nbsp Energy, oil and gas, and rail companies can all similarly benefit from the asset protection advantages offered by fleet geofencing. Streamlining last-mile delivery On delivery routes , geofencing can be used to check assigned routes are followed and ensure service level agreements SLAs are met. With geofencing technology sending out triggered notifications, communication between managers and drivers is simplified too. This also benefits your customer communications as you can easily update them regarding delivery schedules using geofencing data. nbsp Read Why a safer last-mile delivery fleet is more productive . Monitoring rental vehicle activity Moving truck and vehicle rental companies can use fleet geofencing to bill customers more effectively. With geofencing, the company can bill higher fees when vehicles leave predetermined places or identify drivers who are taking vehicles across international borders, which could run counter to the rental agreement. Confining business vehicles Many businesses provide vehicles to employees to perform work. This could be a taxi driver, a snowplow driver, or a city employee on sewer patrol. Geofencing can help ensure your employees stay within their assigned zones. This can simplify dispatch and keep drivers safe too. nbsp Specifically, you might send an alert to field service workers when they rsquo re entering no-go zones in a natural preserve. Or, police fleets may set geofence boundaries around dangerous areas to alert their officers when entering such a location. Tracking commercial fleets With geofencing software, fleet managers can track your vehicles rsquo movement to support fleet optimization and apply safety measures. With alerts about driver idling and detention time, you can also improve route planning to cut fuel usage and optimize vehicle performance . Also, rather than calling and distracting your drivers to ask about their ETAs, you can set geo-boundaries around their loading spots, rest areas, destination, etc., and receive automated reports. Geofencing can also be used to create virtual time stamps and cards with your fleet management software recording working hours when staff passes through the digital, geofenced perimeters. Enjoy geofencing with Motive Using fleet geofencing and GPS tracking can simplify and improve your fleet management . Various industries can see improved customer satisfaction, compliance , driver safety and asset security. Real-time insights from geofencing can reduce administrative burden and enhance performance, utilization, and monitoring.

            "Electric vehicles are finally moving from vision to reality. In Q2 of 2022, EV sales made up 5.6 of the total automotive market , up from just 2.7 in Q2 of 2021. And as new incentives roll out as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, more consumers will make the switch in coming years. But what about electric fleet vehicles ? Many fleet managers are attracted to the idea of EVs for the same reasons as consumers lower fuel costs, simpler maintenance, and greater sustainability. As technology improves and more governments incentivize a shift from fossil fuels, the global electric fleet vehicle market is growing at an estimated 9.51 CAGR and will be worth 848.94 billion by 2030 . So what about your fleet? Is now the right time to begin exploring a shift to hybrid or electric fleet vehicles? nbsp In this guide, we rsquo ll explore Why fleets are transitioning to electric vehicles Which routes and use cases offer the best opportunities for electric fleet vehicles How EVs can improve your fleet rsquo s sustainability nbsp Ways to start transitioning your fleet nbsp Why fleets are transitioning to electric vehicles Fleet managers crave stability, especially in an uncertain economy. They want to protect themselves from fluctuating fuel costs and supply chain disruptions. And they need to improve efficiency in every way possible. Fluctuating fuel prices are prompting many commercial fleets to explore electric vehicles. Budgeting for huge price swings is hard, and last summer rsquo s 40-year highs were tough to swallow. Electric fleet vehicles remove fuel prices from the equation, and electricity rates tend to be more stable. nbsp Meanwhile, EVs also remove the costs of idling by shutting off the motor entirely. By contrast, an idling diesel vehicle can burn 0.8 gallons of fuel per hour , and the average heavy-duty truck idles about 1,800 hours each year . EVs cost less to maintain. They have fewer moving parts than a traditional internal combustion engine ICE no spark plugs, oil filters, timing belts, or other parts that can wear out or break. For example, a Ford E-Transit has 90 fewer powertrain parts than the internal combustion version. nbsp The U.S. Department of Energy rsquo s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy finds that the per-mile maintenance costs of a light-duty electric vehicle averages 6.1 cents per mile, compared to 10.1 cents per mile for a conventional ICE vehicle. nbsp Yes, you rsquo ll still need to replace brakes, wipers, tires, shocks, and other components. But fully electric vehicles have 40 lower scheduled maintenance costs than their gas-powered kin. Battery costs continue to drop , and analysts predict that cheaper battery chemistries will bring down costs further. Where gas engines can fail suddenly and force expensive, unplanned repairs, electric motors tend to gradually degrade over time . A fleet management solution can keep tabs on vehicle health and necessary maintenance and alert you before problems develop. nbsp All this adds up. For example, the projected three-year total cost of ownership of the Ford F-150 Lightning was 2,664 less than the Ford F-150 mdash and that rsquo s without accounting for available tax credits. nbsp Which routes and use cases are best suited for electric fleet vehicles? Some routes and fleets are better suited to going electric now, while others may be better off waiting until manufacturers offer more options and the charging infrastructure expands. nbsp The Department of Energy says fleets and routes are best suited to EVs if they Are dedicated to shorter, predictable routes such as buses or refuse trucks Encounter frequent stop-and-go conditions Have a return-to-base duty cycle Are used on site such as forklifts or ground support equipment That rsquo s why vehicles primarily used for local services or last-mile delivery are prime candidates for switching. EVs rsquo regenerative braking , in which the slowing vehicle rsquo s momentum is captured and reused, is particularly attractive for vehicles that stop frequently. In fact, EVs are most efficient during stop-and-go conditions . Regenerative braking also reduces wear and tear on the brakes themselves. nbsp Though EV ranges are growing, fleets also need to consider the charging infrastructure. Vehicles that travel long distances in remote areas, such as those used on many oil and gas sites, may not have reliable access to EV chargers. Hybrids can offer a good alternative for these vehicles. nbsp However, many fleets can easily install the necessary chargers in a central lot, especially if their vehicles ldquo return to base rdquo each day. The Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Tax Credit may reimburse 30 of the cost of these chargers, depending on your fleet rsquo s eligibility. Many state and local incentives are also available, with many more proposed. nbsp How electric fleet vehicles can improve sustainability nbsp Sustainability takes many forms. Your fleet may have documented sustainability goals around reducing emissions or improving your carbon footprint mdash or you may simply want to ensure that your business is sustainable during unstable times. nbsp Either way, electric fleet vehicles can help you reach your sustainability goals by Reducing carbon emissions in measurable ways Cutting fuel and maintenance costs Improving vehicle longevity Streamlining compliance with evolving regulations Switching to electric fleet vehicles can also improve your company rsquo s image, which may attract new customers. Plus, more workers are choosing to work for companies with active sustainability goals. Nearly 70 of survey respondents said they rsquo re more likely to stay long term with a company that has a strong environmental agenda, while 40 of millennials say they have chosen a job specifically because the company had a sustainability plan. nbsp Fleets that have gone electric are reporting happier, less-stressed drivers now that they rsquo re operating quieter vehicles with fewer vibrations. Cutting noise pollution is good public relations, too. How to start transitioning to electric fleet vehicles Think EVs may be a good fit for your fleet? nbsp Consider starting your own pilot program. Identify a few vehicles that are due for replacement. See what manufacturers are currently offering and take test drives. Then start doing some math. nbsp The Department of Energy DOE has a vehicle cost calculator that lets you compare the costs based on your typical usage. Some utilities and manufacturers are adding calculators to their websites that let you estimate your costs. Peterbilt s calculator lets you calculate total cost of ownership per mile and per hour for electric on-highway tractors, refuse trucks, and medium-duty cabovers. nbsp Next, ask your test drivers for their honest assessments. What did they like? What didn rsquo t they like? What surprises did they encounter? Finally, monitor your EV telematics in your fleet management solution to gauge your savings. Compare idling time and mileage against your gas-powered vehicles. How much would it have cost to fill up at the pump compared to your electric bill? Once you have a few months of data, you rsquo ll have the information you need to decide your next steps. You might determine your fleet is well suited for EVs, or you may need to experiment with a different vehicle. Maybe you reserve electric fleet vehicles for your shorter routes and look at hybrids for longer routes. But don rsquo t write off the idea entirely. With time, you rsquo ll have more options than ever, just as the infrastructure will expand to meet the needs of commercial fleets. nbsp How Motive can help nbsp Want to learn how Motive rsquo s fleet management solution can support your transition to electric vehicles?

            "Keeping expenses in check while maintaining employee and customer satisfaction is always a challenge. For many businesses, one way to cut overhead is reducing logistics costs. It can be especially challenging to manage logistics costs in the current economy. Fortunately, this article details top tips and useful takeaways that can help tackle logistics costs strategically. Different types of transportation logistics costs When freight is crucial to your business operations, there are many transportation logistics costs that businesses need to address in addition to the rising prices of fuel. Before digging into the ways to reduce this budget line, it rsquo s important that you have a full picture of the common types of logistic costs. To locate waste or excess, you first need to examine every logistics expense and understand exactly how much you re spending. Transportation The big cost when talking logistics is transportation. Getting product from its point of origin to its destination can be a multi-stage process. You might tackle transportation in-house with your own fleet or by using power-only trucking providers . Others outsource to freight carriers, brokers, or third-party logistics providers 3PL . Depending on the distance and route, more than one mode of transport could be involved. When cargo is moving from truck, to ship, to train, and back to a truck for last-mile delivery, there can be additional costs because of all the transportation mode shifting. The transportation company itself needs to plan for recurring costs, such as fuel, vehicle maintenance, and insurance . There may also be expenses around driver uniforms, routing and dispatching software , and training employees. Warehousing Having to store freight for any amount of time before or after transport can be costly. Space is at a premium, so the more inventory you have, the larger footprint you rsquo ll need. You can rent warehouse space to avoid purchasing property outright, but you may still have to account for insurance, utilities, and security. Within the warehouse, equipment and supplies also need to be tallied in your budget. You rsquo ll need storage solutions whether it rsquo s traditional shelving, high-bay or high-density mobile shelving, or particular pallet technology , as well as boxes, pallets, forklifts, and other tools. Inventory software can be another related cost. Labor Whether you rsquo re paying drivers for the trucks on the road or warehouse staff to pack and pick your product for distribution, you rsquo re paying for labor. There are also costs associated with the employees who manage and monitor your logistics supply chain. You rsquo ll also need to account for the people playing the administrative roles of managing your human resources, including processing payroll and hiring new employees. Measuring costs and performance The best way to reduce transportation logistics costs is to know what you rsquo re spending and where. Using software to measure costs and track performance lets you make data-driven decisions while also providing the tools to Manage freight and shipping costs. Meet service agreements. Automate job scheduling. Improve transit time and routes. Optimize dispatch . Monitor vehicle health. Track driver behavior and prevent accidents. Simplify document management. Enhance warehouse productivity. Provide visibility into supply chain. With a centralized view of the logistics information that saves you logging in and out of different platforms, you can also reduce labor related to measuring your costs and KPIs. 5 tips to reduce transportation logistics costs Optimizing inventory and cutting warehouse spend can help you cut logistics costs. You rsquo ll also find many ways to lower overheard by applying best practices for cost reduction in transport logistics. 1. Cut fleet maintenance costs By embracing a preventative maintenance strategy, your business takes a proactive approach to keeping assets in optimal condition. Taking a time-based, usage-based, failure-finding, or prescriptive approach to preventative maintenance helps maximize availability, and prevent sudden, expensive malfunctions and downtimes. nbsp Along with improved vehicle reliability, you can save money from avoiding the huge expenditures that come from leaving an issue undetected or unattended. Additionally, you can extend the service life of assets for bottom line gains too. 2. Find the best routes for your fleet Optimizing truck utilization is critical to fleet success. By tracking loads and routes you may be able to identify inefficiencies that are leading to extra idling time or deadhead miles . nbsp Creating efficient routes to minimize travel times also helps you meet deadlines customers love that . Unhappy customers can cost you in returns, lost revenue, and long-term business. nbsp Streamlining routes to minimize travel times also means lower mileage . This can lower your fuel costs and also add less wear and tear on vehicle assets. This can also free up your drivers so they can be dispatched to their next route, and you can get more value from that driver rsquo s hours of service . 3. Reduce fleet accidents and safety incidents Improving safety on the road benefits logistics budgets as you avoid costly stoppages. Any delay in delivering freight when it rsquo s promised to the customer can mean added expenses. In the case of a serious safety incident, you might also incur fines for violations. Plus, there are the resources expended on resolving the situation, reporting the accident, exonerating the driver, and ensuring the cargo still gets to where it needs to go. A strong safety culture can help cut costs as it will support your driver retention and recruiting. Spending on safety can also save you the cost of bad publicity. When today rsquo s in-demand drivers are deciding where to sign up, safety is a growing priority . nbsp 4. Prevent theft and equipment misuse Cargo theft is often a crime of opportunity, so it rsquo s important to protect against it. Start by educating your drivers on best practices to defend against cargo theft . Keep drivers informed about the latest trends, known hijacking hotspots, and how they can improve safety when stopping for refueling, meal breaks, or layovers. nbsp Replacing transportation logistics equipment isn rsquo t cheap. With asset tracking, you can keep tabs on equipment and people to help prevent thefts and equipment misuse. nbsp Real-time tracking and geofence alerts nbsp can tell you when your equipment enters or exits a site. nbsp You can also specify certain time periods say, outside of working hours to get notified if equipment is unexpectedly moved or used. nbsp If an asset is stolen, continuous asset tracking can help you work with local authorities for timely recovery. nbsp 5. Consolidate shipments When multiple less-than-truckload LTL shipments are combined together, it rsquo s called consolidated shipping . Consolidated shipments can help a business take advantage of full-truck-load FTL rates. For the fleet, consolidating customer shipments to fill the truck can also offer economies of scale. A full truck generally means more revenue from that route. When considering consolidating shipments, you might decide to separate the time-sensitive cargo to avoid paying a premium to expedite an entire load. Instead, send only the urgent freight and then rely on a slower, cheaper mode for the remainder. nbsp How Motive helps reduce logistics costs There are many factors to balance in reducing logistics costs. But there rsquo s good news. Using the top tips in this post makes lowering logistics costs an achievable goal. nbsp Want to make achieving that goal even simpler? Consider Motive rsquo s AI-powered fleet management platform when tackling your cost-savings objectives. nbsp Our fleet management solution provides visibility into your assets via GPS tracking .

            "Oil and gas companies must adhere to strict regulations or face stiff fines and penalties. And those regulations are constantly tightening. According to McKinsey amp Company, regulatory compliance costs have tripled for the oil and gas industry since the late 1990s. Most companies struggle to stay ahead of these evolving regulations, even as unstable markets threaten their profitability. nbsp Federal and state agencies each have their own reporting and compliance requirements for drilling locations, waste management, environmental matters, and safety issues. Things become especially strict when working on federal lands under the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Interior, and Bureau of Land Management BLM . In addition to tracking driver hours and vehicle inspections, oil and gas companies must comply with special rules around hauling and working with hazardous materials. Tracking hours-of-service HOS compliance grows even more difficult when factoring in the unique HOS exceptions that allow for waiting time at oil and gas sites . Plus, drivers for oil and gas companies often work alone on desolate routes far from headquarters. That can make it harder to catch potential compliance issues. nbsp Yet the costs of non-compliance are significant. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC can impose civil penalties of up to 1 million per day during continuing violations. The Bureau of Land Management can inflict additional fines and penalties and terminate an operator rsquo s lease agreement. nbsp That rsquo s why highly regulated oil and gas companies sometimes spend 5 to 10 of their annual revenue on compliance . nbsp Motive can help you streamline fleet compliance to protect your bottom line. With Motive rsquo s fleet management solution , you can Automate logging and paperwork. Simplify hours-of-service reporting for every driver. Understand your fleet rsquo s overall compliance and recognize opportunity for improvement. Stay compliant with changing regulations. Achieve better roadside inspections. Fleets using Motive rsquo s compliance solution have seen 50 fewer hours-of-service violations, spend up to 50 less time on compliance tasks, and have seen as much as a 25 reduction in insurance costs . nbsp Learn how simplifying oil and gas compliance can help improve profitability and peace of mind. Automate the paperwork Safety departments can save countless hours while reducing violations by using Motive rsquo s Vehicle Gateway to automate oil and gas compliance. Motive rsquo s Compliance Hub and Fleet App make it easy to Monitor driver logs and duty status. Match unpaired drivers. Resolve form and manner errors. Identify critical issues and violations. Artificial intelligence can resolve unidentified trips faster by automatically matching trips and drivers. Real-time email alerts instantly notify you of HOS violations and Vehicle Gateway disconnects, prompting you to check in on drivers operating on high-risk sites . Motive also streamlines IFTA reporting by automatically tracking IFTA fuel purchases by jurisdiction for every vehicle in your fleet. With digital fuel receipt management, Motive automatically summarizes the distance and fuel purchased in each state or province, then delivers a single-click, exportable report. You can even set geofences around yards or terminals to automatically annotate driving events such as a yard move, eliminating the need to manually note it. nbsp Understand and improve your fleet rsquo s overall compliance nbsp Together, the Motive Compliance Hub and Motive Fleet App present a complete view of your fleet rsquo s compliance health, right from your smartphone or tablet. But it goes deeper than just seeing the current health. Motive can give you the information you need to make proactive changes by showing you The most common types of violations. Compliance trends. Driver leaderboards. Motive rsquo s proactive CSA monitoring also helps identify critical safety issues among your drivers. Pair it with Motive rsquo s DRIVE risk score to fully understand each driver rsquo s risk profile, then deliver automated coaching to the drivers who need it. Overall, proactive monitoring like this helps you Keep drivers safer. Improve ELD compliance. nbsp Lower CSA scores. Reduce audit risk. Streamline hours-of-service reporting Drivers appreciate simplified HOS reporting in the Motive Driver App. The Motive HOS countdown clock clearly displays remaining drive time, and pre-violation alerts give drivers time to find a place to safely park. Multiple team members can use the same device to track their own HOS. Plus, Bluetooth ensures ELD connectivity on even the most remote oil and gas sites. nbsp Stay compliant with changing regulations Motive keeps track of evolving regulations to ensure you stay compliant. For example, soon after the FMCSA rolled out significant changes to the HOS rules in 2020, Motive pushed the updates to the Motive Driver App. nbsp When the oilfield waiting time exception was announced, Motive heard from hundreds of drivers who wanted support. We then updated the Motive electronic logbook app to allow oil and gas drivers to record waiting time on a fifth line on their log view this step-by-step tutorial . nbsp As Trade Star rsquo s Kari Gib found, Motive ensures that the entire fleet stays on top of regulations and exemptions. ldquo Even if my drivers are not 100 familiar with the HOS rules, Motive is, rdquo he says. ldquo So using Motive is as if I was sitting next to my drivers instructing them when to pull over. rdquo Automating regulation updates also reduces the risk of human error or misinterpretation. Achieve better roadside inspections Motive rsquo s vehicle and asset inspection feature lets you create custom DVIRs to ensure oil and gas compliance across the fleet by mirroring your fleet rsquo s workflows, vehicles, and assets. nbsp The Motive Driver App lets drivers complete logs and inspection reports right in the app. Inspection Mode makes it easier to ace roadside inspections by easily sending ELD output files to officers while ensuring they only see the required information. Drivers can complete their DVIRs right in the Motive Driver App and add accompanying comments and photos. With improved visibility, you can repair damage quickly to avoid expensive downtime. Trade Star has enjoyed impeccable roadside inspections since they began using Motive. In fact, the FMCSA allowed Trade Star to skip a companywide audit because the drivers rsquo logs are so accurate.

            "With 2022 in the rearview, it rsquo s a new year with a fresh outlook. And in the world of commercial transportation, anything can happen. Here are Motive rsquo s top predictions for 2023. 1. Workers for new construction projects will be hard to find When President Biden signed the 1.2 trillion infrastructure bill into law in November 2021, people across the supply chain exhaled at the prospect of all that new work. This year, a less rosy picture is developing as a shortage of craft workers and commercial transportation drivers threatens to derail new building projects before they even begin. The infrastructure bill calls for repairs to be made to 65,000 miles of road and 1,500 bridges. The only question now is, who will make them? nbsp 2. Demand for electric vehicles will surge As charging infrastructure for electric vehicles EVs grows, demand for EVs is accelerating too. From construction to last-mile delivery , people want in on the EV action. In 2023, commercial EVs will be more accessible than ever. nbsp In construction, electrification of mini-excavators and other urban machines is leading the way as cities strive to reduce emissions and noise. In last-mile delivery , expect Walmart to deliver groceries through an all-electric fleet this year, especially after purchasing up to 10,000 EVs from Canoo last year. nbsp Among Class 8 vehicles, expect an abundance of battery-electric and electric fuel cell options , along with more charging access. Last year, Navistar launched Michigan rsquo s first public EV charging station off I-94, one of the largest freight arteries in the Midwest. The station is optimized for charging large commercial vehicles, nbsp including Class 8 electric trucks. nbsp 3. We rsquo ll see the impact of AB 5 enforcement Known formally as ldquo California Assembly Bill 5 rdquo and casually as ldquo the gig worker law, rdquo AB 5 originally was intended to ensure that gig workers were treated fairly by Uber and Lyft. While Lyft and Uber evaded the impacts of this controversial independent contractor rule, the California trucking industry, somehow, did not. nbsp California trucking fleets that rely on the driving services of independent contractors must now make their owner-operators employees or risk being sued and fined for misclassifying workers . With as many as 70,000 independent owner-operators throughout California, this is no small issue mdash nbsp and one that ignores the fact that owner-operators actually like working for themselves . All eyes will be on the California trucking industry as we begin to see how strictly the AB 5 rule is enforced, and how costly non-compliance proves to be. 4. Faced with a labor shortage, fleets will turn to AI for help In 2022, artificial intelligence AI made headlines for its artistry . In 2023, the buzz will focus on AI rsquo s ability to improve safety and productivity. According to the article ldquo Top 5 Edge AI Trends to Watch in 2023 , ldquo more companies are looking to use AI to add proactive and flexible safety measures to industrial environments. rdquo nbsp That rsquo s certainly true in commercial transportation, where fleets are turning to AI dash cams to identify and stop unsafe driving behaviors before an accident occurs. AI-based tools improve safety as much as they increase retention , relying on automated coaching to develop and retain valued team members. That rsquo s the magic of AI. And with the lack of talent on the market, fleets need all the magic they can get. 5. Challenges will arise with Canadian ELD mandate enforcement U.S. trucking fleets have had to comply with the ELD mandate since December 2017, but their colleagues across the Canadian border are getting their first taste of the ELD mandate right now. ELD enforcement in Canada went into effect January 1, impacting Canadian fleets as well as U.S. fleets that operate in Canada. Though businesses have been preparing for the Canadian ELD mandate for much of the last year, the newly enforced rules will make for a bumpy ride. nbsp Transport Canada is moving quickly to ensure that security protocols and encryption standards are in place for enforcement officers and commercial transportation fleets to take advantage of. But encryption standards aren rsquo t implemented everywhere. That means some emails may not be able to be sent and read properly, and law enforcement may not be able to read logs roadside. Other challenges are sure to crop up as well. Take a deep breath, we rsquo ll all get through it. nbsp Still unprepared for the rollout? Watch Motive rsquo s webinar on the Canadian ELD mandate to get up to speed quickly. 6. Autonomous vehicles will advance, but at a moderate pace Every year seems like ldquo this will be the year that autonomous vehicles AVs will make a splash. Yet the years come and go with more of a ripple from AVs than a splash. That rsquo s why, even with all the meaningful advancements being made in AVs, we don rsquo t expect rapid gains in autonomous vehicle technology this year. nbsp As Freightwaves reports , ldquo FMCSA has a long-awaited proposed rule on automated driving systems ADS penciled on its calendar for January , but industry insiders believe this date will pass without a Federal Register notice. rdquo One DOT official explained, ldquo It rsquo s a major rulemaking, and the agency tends not to come out with major rulemakings at the beginning of the year mdash especially with a new Congress being seated and the party change in the House . rdquo In other words, AVs still look like an innovation of the future. 7. Speed limiters will attract much attention and little resolution nbsp Last spring, when the FMCSA issued a notice of intent to mandate speed limits on commercial transportation trucks in 2023, the notice generated more than 15,000 concerned responses from independent owner-operators and small fleets. As the year progressed, concerns didn rsquo t exactly subside. By the time the American Transportation Research Institute released its Top Industry Issues Report for 2022 , speed limiters ranked in the top 10 for the first time. nbsp Owner-operators and small fleets argue that the safety benefits and stressful impacts of such a mandate are questionable, while large fleets and safety groups advocate for a 70 mph speed limit. Expect the FMCSA to release its speed limiter proposal this summer, letting it play out slowly in the lead-up to the 2024 election. nbsp 2022 commercial transportation in review nbsp Want more?

            "See how fleet safety has evolved, and what the future holds for exonerations, accident prevention, and more in this article by Motive CEO Shoaib Makani.\n",
            "Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for people 54 and under. That kind of stat reminds us that we can never be too safe on the roads. Every year, we rsquo re filled with hope that accidents will decline and lives will be saved, and still the losses tick upward instead of down. In 2021, transportation incidents were the most frequent cause of work-related death, leading to the loss of nearly 2,000 lives . It rsquo s a staggering number by any measure. These are the people who grow our food, transport our materials, stock our stores, and pipe energy to our homes. Then there are the financial costs. According to the National Safety Council, the average cost of a fatal motor vehicle collision in 2020 was 1.7 million, and those costs can soar even higher if a large truck is involved. FMCSA data about fatal accidents in large commercial vehicles specifically says financial impacts can be as high as 7 million per incident. Add to the mix high insurance rates and the impact on brand reputation, and costs can continue long after the accident itself. nbsp Bringing people and technology together to increase safety on our roads is hard work, and we still have a long way to go. At Motive, we invest a lot of time and energy into understanding the challenges our customers are facing, and developing powerful technologies that deliver the best results to businesses in every corner of the physical economy. As we look to the future, it rsquo s important to learn from the recent past and understand the ways safety has evolved. nbsp nbsp The beginning of safety tech exoneration When Motive launched as KeepTruckin, dash cams were an important new tool that gave businesses a kind of security they rsquo d never had before video evidence. When accidents happen, commercial drivers, and the companies they work for, often get blamed, even if it isn rsquo t their fault. So, backed by the power of video, fleet operators finally had a way to prove they weren rsquo t to blame. The finger-pointing of the past gave way to quick resolution, where there could be little debate about what happened or who was responsible. As nuclear verdicts began to spread through trucking and other industries, video became an even more critical asset for commercial fleets. Dash cam clips gave businesses the power to clear their names and protect themselves from unwarranted multimillion-dollar payouts. nbsp Using dash cams for exoneration was a reactive approach to safety, however. As great as it was to have this resource, managers ended up spending hours looking for a single piece of accident footage that could exonerate their business, and it soon became clear they just didn rsquo t have time for it. nbsp Exoneration after the fact was never going to be powerful or proactive enough. What fleets really needed was nbsp the ability to prevent accidents from happening at all. Safety programs evolve AI-powered accident prevention Artificial intelligence AI has the potential to change fleet safety . Today rsquo s AI dash cams can identify unsafe driving immediately and alert drivers to it just as fast. Real-time feedback for drivers means they can hear the alert in the vehicle and change their behavior on the spot. But even with AI rsquo s potential to prevent accidents, it rsquo s important to remember that AI can only deliver on its potential if it rsquo s accurate. The more accurate the AI, the more reliably it can detect things like cell phone use, close following, rolling stops, and all the unsafe driving behaviors that put operators at risk. Artificial intelligence that rsquo s consistently accurate over a long period of time helps customers build trust in the product, giving them the confidence they need to root out unsafe behaviors in more lasting ways. And when AI isn rsquo t accurate? Well, bad things happen. nbsp It rsquo s easy to get overwhelmed by false alerts and quickly lose trust in the product. People want a way to make in-cab alerts less distracting and more impactful. When there rsquo s too much noise, they rsquo ll turn down the volume. And when a managed service controls the data fleet managers receive and dictates how fleet performance is measured, it can feel like someone else is running the show. Accurate AI helped fleet managers eliminate the static they rsquo d been seeing in their programs. They liked the results, and it left them wanting more control over other aspects of their program. Next tech-enabled culture of safety In safety rsquo s next chapter, operations managers will be empowered to establish a robust safety culture. One that rsquo s customized, cooperative, and complete. Automation, cloud-based software, and the Internet of Things IoT will continue to strengthen safety culture in new and innovative ways. Managers will be able to impact results immediately, without having to hire more people. Here rsquo s a closer look at the kind of control they can expect from fleet safety solutions going forward A customized safety platform that puts fleets in control of the details. Safety rsquo s next chapter needs to let operations leaders define safety any way they choose, with fine-tuned controls that match driver capabilities to company needs. As fleets expand their safety programs, customization will grow with it. Businesses will be able to trigger more in-cab alerts for new drivers and fewer alerts for veterans. However fleets customize their safety programs will be up to them mdash nbsp and that rsquo s exactly how it should be. nbsp nbsp A safety program that is cooperative with drivers around coaching and scoring. At the end of the day, everyone wants the same thing for drivers to get home safely. Safety platforms need to ensure that managers and drivers are all traveling in the same direction, and in the most efficient ways possible. Driver coaching will become much more about independent growth, where drivers have the opportunity and the privacy to improve without manager intervention. Automated self-coaching tools will give drivers more control over their own safety performance, along with the power to proactively review safety videos through their smartphones and coach themselves on their own time. Managers and drivers can then work together to establish safety goals and reward drivers for a job well done. An all-in-one platform that provides a holistic view of fleet safety . To lead on safety, fleets have to stop thinking about safety as a stand-alone entity and start treating it as the centerpiece of a holistic fleet strategy. Housing safety, compliance, maintenance, and fuel spend information on a single, unified platform creates a 360-degree view of fleet operations that gives leaders the clearest picture possible of what safety looks like and how to manage it. nbsp The future is evolving, and we will evolve with it. With the help of technology, we rsquo ll see fewer accidents, safer roads, and lives saved. This is just the start of what fleets will be able to achieve in safety rsquo s next chapter mdash and we rsquo re committed to helping them write it.\n",

            "A healthier supply chain is driving down inflation, but we rsquo re seeing soft retail demand nbsp Welcome to the inaugural Motive Monthly Economic Report, where we break down the biggest supply chain and economic trends being observed across the Motive platform. Motive serves over 120,000 customers who operate in the physical economy, from small businesses to Fortune 500 enterprises. Our customers power the growth of the U.S. supply chain mdash in construction, oil and gas, transportation and logistics, agriculture, distribution, and beyond. They rsquo re the people who grow our food, transport our materials, stock our stores, and pipe energy to our homes. Motive technology is installed in more than 20 of all for-hire trucks in North America, giving us representative insight into the over-the-road supply chain. We rsquo re excited to give you a front-seat view into the factors that are moving the U.S. economy. nbsp Stronger start to January for freight nbsp What rsquo s new We rsquo ve seen an 11 increase in truck utilization compared to January 2022. Since November, diesel fuel prices have declined by 15 . Backups at U.S. ports have cleared, trucking capacity has increased, and lead times and transportation costs have normalized to pre-COVID levels. nbsp Why this matters Inflation is cooling. The Consumer Price Index CPI is showing a decline in energy prices and food prices relative to the mid-2022 high inflationary period. A healthier supply chain and reduced transportation costs will continue to support this downward trend. Still early days of retail recovery nbsp What rsquo s new The supply chain is healthier and we rsquo re seeing overall increases in freight activity. But we rsquo re not seeing a corresponding rebound in the retail sector following the holidays. In fact, we rsquo ve seen a 20 decline in retail activity year-over-year . nbsp Our assessment Several factors are driving the disconnect between supply chain health and retail recovery. nbsp In December, we saw a build up of holiday retail visits, which was delayed against 2021. The sales-to-inventory ratios are largely static. Businesses aren rsquo t investing in inventory due to softness in consumer demand. nbsp Unemployment is the lowest it s been since 1969, resulting in a tight labor market for the physical economy and challenges in hiring truck drivers, construction workers, and field service workers. nbsp Why this matters Retailers have been battling the impact of years-long supply chain impacts followed by weak consumer demand. Inflation is improving, but it rsquo s still high and the economy is unsteady. Continued health in the supply chain should help stabilize some pockets of the economy, but top retailers are being cautious, which may be the new normal. With little confidence in the near-term outlook, retailers are hesitant to increase inventory. Buyers, meanwhile, are in ldquo wait and see rdquo mode knowing that there will be fewer supply chain risk than in years prior. Data methodology nbsp Motive data represents over 120,000 customers, half a million vehicles, and millions of drivers, nbsp from small businesses to enterprise fleets. Our customers work in every sector of the physical economy, including trucking and logistics, delivery, construction, food and beverage, oil and gas, and more. Motive rsquo s technology is embedded into more than 20 of for-hire trucks in North America, giving Motive a representative view of the over-the-road supply chain. nbsp\n",

            "CONTENT:\n",
            "Since the ELD mandate was first published in 2015, different types of carriers worked toward a series of deadlines. Meanwhile, the industry lobbied for exemptions for small carriers, owner-operators, and other groups. nbsp Today, the ELD mandate is in full effect. All non-exempt commercial drivers must use FMCSA-registered electronic logging devices also known as electronic logbooks or e-logs to record their hours-of-service and duty status information. If a non-exempt driver lacks an approved ELD or is found to be falsifying logs, they can be placed out of service for at least 10 hours . In total, 22 different ELD-related violations can reduce drivers rsquo CSA scores . However, that ldquo non-exempt rdquo is important. After much negotiation, several exemptions to the ELD mandate are now on the books. These exemptions primarily affect small carriers and owner-operators making short hauls, but they also hinge on vehicle size and purpose. Many small fleets that don rsquo t need to fully comply with the ELD mandate still must track driver hours and other data. ELDs and fleet management solutions can help these fleets comply while reducing some of the administrative burden. ELD rules and regulations The ELD mandate requires carriers to use an ELD to electronically record each driver rsquo s Record of Duty Status RODS . The requirement eliminates the paper logbooks previously used to comply with FMCSA rsquo s hours-of-service HOS rules . An ELD tracks each driver rsquo s HOS in real time, along with location, date, vehicle miles, engine hours, and other data. nbsp During roadside inspections , drivers must prove they rsquo re using an ELD that complies with FMCSA regulations. They must also show recent driver logs to prove HOS compliance. nbsp In general, the ELD mandate applies to commercial vehicles involved in interstate commerce with engines manufactured after the 2000 model year. That includes about 3.4 million drivers and 3 million to 4 million vehicles that meet at least one of these criteria Weigh more than 10,001 pounds Transport hazardous materials in a quantity that requires placards Transport nine or more passengers for compensation Transport 16 or more passengers not for compensation Overall, drivers who do not have to maintain RODS or are involved in driveway-towaway operations do not need to comply with the ELD mandate. nbsp ELD exemptions for small carriers Congress briefly considered the Small Carrier Electronic Logging Device Exemption Act of 2019 to exempt owner-operators and carriers with 10 or fewer trucks. Since the bill never made it out of committee, small carriers and owner-operators must follow the same rules as larger fleets. Even so, small carriers should be aware of the ELD exemptions for short-haul carriers. nbsp What defines a ldquo short-haul carrier rdquo nbsp Short-haul carriers do indeed have some exemptions . The ldquo short-haul rdquo exemption applies to vehicles and drivers who operate within a 150-air-mile radius of their work reporting location 172.6 land miles . Short-haul drivers are limited to 14 consecutive hours on duty. Drivers who complete eight or fewer long-haul jobs per 30-day period are also exempt from the ELD mandate, though they must comply with RODS requirements and log their hours, whether manually or via an AOBRD. nbsp Electronic logs for small carriers nbsp Small carriers often have a lot to gain from ELDs, even if they aren rsquo t mandated to use them. After all, many drivers still must track their RODS and HOS in some format, even if it rsquo s on paper. nbsp Paper logs are prone to problems. Drivers may forget to record their entries or misplace the paper logs. And then it rsquo s up to an administrative person to reconcile paper logs with schedules, receipts, and other records mdash sometimes weeks after the fact. nbsp Many small-carrier and owner-operator drivers find ELDs can help with their tracking. In general, ELDs help drivers focus on driving rather than paperwork. nbsp Small carriers juggling multiple drivers and routes can benefit from a more robust fleet management solution that includes an ELD. For example, Motive rsquo s fleet management solution includes a dashboard that makes it easy for fleet managers to view each driver rsquo s log to identify gaps , ensuring each logbook is complete and accurate. nbsp Plus, Motive rsquo s electronic logbooks help drivers ace roadside inspections by ensuring they rsquo re organized with all the information they need. Motive rsquo s ELD can also alert drivers before they reach their HOS limit , giving them time to find a spot to safely park mdash and avoid violations. The Motive Compliance Hub can reduce a fleet rsquo s time spent on ELD and HOS compliance by up to 50 while helping reduce HOS violations by up to 50 . Together, the Compliance Hub and Fleet App can help fleet managers View driver logs and on-the-go duty status Resolve form and manner errors nbsp Spot vehicle and asset defects in inspection reports nbsp Minimize violations by alerting drivers and managers before they occur Identify which drivers need coaching to reduce their CSA scores Gain visibility into trends over time, such as types of violations and driver behavior Reduce the costs of violations nbsp ELD exemptions for owner-operators Any owner-operator who must maintain RODS and HOS records must also comply with the ELD mandate if their vehicle rsquo s engine was manufactured after the 2000 model year. The same short-haul exemptions apply to owner-operators. Electronic logs for owner-operators The smallest carriers are those run by owner-operators mdash yet they must maintain the same records as much larger operators. Owner-operators can find ELDs especially helpful, as they provide a consistent, easy way to track driving time. The Motive Driver App makes it especially simple by allowing drivers to keep time off their logs when allowed by FMCSA rules, such as during yard moves or personal conveyance . This helps drivers ensure they don rsquo t exceed HOS limits while performing permitted activities. nbsp Record hours of service with the Motive Driver App The Motive Driver App provides an easy, intuitive way for small carriers and owner-operators to electronically log their driving, even if they rsquo re exempt from the ELD mandate. Through the Motive Driver App, you can ensure you have a complete, accurate record that rsquo s ready for your next roadside inspection . nbsp For example, the Motive Driver App automatically prompts drivers to update any unsigned logs and unidentified driving events . And you can even insert a past duty status if you forget to do so. Motive also keeps track of evolving regulations to help you stay compliant. When the FMCSA changed the HOS rules in 2020, Motive quickly pushed updates to the Motive Driver App .

            "The inner workings of hours-of-service HOS rules can be beyond overwhelming. Between the tracking, the enforcing, and every little detail in between, staying compliant can become a demanding task. With new HOS rules, staying current on all the details and updates takes staying compliant to a whole new level. nbsp As an example, you already know that the FMCSA established the hours of service rules to promote safety on the road by keeping drivers alert and awake. But did you know that non-compliance of HOS rules can cause drivers to go inactive or get stung with hefty fines that can be thousands of dollars? On June 1, 2020, the FMCSA revised four major provisions of the HOS rules to provide flexibility without compromising driver safety. As of September 2020, motor carriers are required to comply with the new HOS rules, making it imperative to stay compliant with all hours-of-service rules mdash old and new mdash to keep your fleet on the road. nbsp Did we mention the HOS exemptions and exceptions? Some vehicles or types of fleets may be exempt from the hours-of-service rules. This is where the Motive HOS Guide comes in.

            "Hello! My name is Jason Pesek and I help manage the Motive Driver App. I joined Motive more than five years ago and have seen a large transformation of the company and the transportation industry. nbsp We now serve various types of fleets in multiple countries. The industry has become more forward-looking with advancements in areas like safety, telematics, fuel efficiency, and routing. The Motive Driver App started out as a free electronic logbook app and, thanks to driver word of mouth, quickly saw downloads from more than 2 million drivers. nbsp Over time, the Motive Driver App has become a full-service driver app that helps with everything from compliance and safety to maintenance and dispatch, and now fleet fuel cards . So much has changed, and yet our commitment to you, the drivers, has never wavered. Our goal is to put you first and build the best solution we can for you. This means that we rsquo re constantly looking for ways to make your lives easier and build features that solve real problems. nbsp Before we launch any change, we work directly with drivers and fleets to ensure our updates make the right impact. This doesn rsquo t mean that we always get the process right, but we always strive to make things easier for you. This includes visiting countless truck stops, attending trade shows like MATS and GATS, and going onsite to visit with customers so we can better understand your needs and build new features that provide real value. Now, let rsquo s talk about the Driver App changes You rsquo ve probably noticed some recent changes to the Driver App, which I want to explain. Let rsquo s focus on three key changes. 1. A new home screen We added the new Driver App home screen as a way to help you understand what rsquo s important rather than assuming that logs are where you always want to start. This change reduces the taps it takes to get to inspections. It also makes it easier to kick off workflows, sign logs, review safety events, or reply to messages. nbsp 2. Inspections for vehicles and assets are now split We based this update on feedback we received from drivers and fleet managers who need a way to complete inspections without a trailer, or a trailer inspection when you rsquo ve already inspected the tractor. 3. Text is bigger and easier to read nbsp This update follows a trend that rsquo s happening across all mobile apps, and is based on countless feedback from drivers who felt the text in the Driver App was too small and that it was too easy to tap the wrong button. Change can be hard and we don rsquo t take it lightly When the Driver App was first designed, it revolutionized the industry. Things have changed quite a bit since then, and we need to continue to evolve so we can provide you with the best experience possible. nbsp We rsquo ve made these changes so we can nbsp Make the app easier to use Help you be more efficient Build better tools to help you with your day To do this, we need to make changes to the Driver App that are different from what you rsquo re used to. Not everyone will like this, but it rsquo s important to make these changes so we can continue to make the app better. And I promise we are working to bring amazing features like Dark Mode and Accessibility Support so each driver can customize how the app looks to fit their needs. We read every review and piece of feedback that you have for us and are constantly working to make it the best app for drivers. Soon, we ll be releasing changes to the duty status screens to make the save button more accessible for landscape mode. We rsquo ll fix the Android keyboard layout issue and we rsquo ll ensure we optimize the app for split mode. nbsp We appreciate your patience as we work to make things better. If you ever have any feedback, feel free to send me a text at 407 674-9962. I rsquo ll try my best to read through everyone rsquo s comments and reply! Thanks for all you do!\n",

            "Driver logs have come a long way from a spiral notebook. While electronic logbooks are now mandated, they rsquo re changing mdash and improving mdash how fleets do business. nbsp In the past, some drivers would stop by their fleet headquarters with several weeks rsquo worth of handwritten logs. An office worker would be left to interpret their handwriting and meticulously compare every entry against receipts and orders. nbsp Today rsquo s driver logs and electronic logbooks are doing more than simply helping drivers manage their hours-of-service HOS compliance. ELDs generate a wealth of data that includes details about each driver rsquo s trip, total hours worked, distance traveled, hours of service, and inspection reports. More sophisticated ELDs, like Motive rsquo s fleet management solution , can automate compliance while managing special driving categories in the ELD mandate that allow drivers to keep driving time off their logs. Thanks to modern driver logs and electronic logbooks, fleets and drivers can Save time Increase productivity Improve compliance with federal and state mandates Take a more proactive approach to risk management nbsp In this guide, we rsquo ll review what today rsquo s driver logs and electronic logbooks can do, how to manage and edit them, how fleet managers can get the most out of their investment, and current compliance standards. What are driver logs and electronic logbooks? An electronic logging device ELD system , also known as an electronic logbook, includes a device that connects to the electronic control module of a vehicle rsquo s engine. By connecting to a diagnostic port, the ELD automatically tracks a vehicle rsquo s drive time and stores the record of duty status RODS and other data. nbsp By improving HOS tracking and reducing violations, the U.S. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA estimates electronic logbooks will reduce annual incidents each year , including 1,844 fewer crashes 562 fewer injuries 26 fewer deaths But the benefits go beyond safety. Many fleets report that more complete and accurate driver logs and electronic logbooks are improving their CSA scores , which can lead to lower insurance costs. Likewise, electronic logbooks can prove a driver was not over HOS limits when involved in a crash while providing details about the crash itself. When paired with dash cam footage , an electronic logbook can even exonerate a driver by showing what really happened. nbsp With more complete driver logs and electronic logbooks, drivers can easily ace roadside inspections . After all, roadside inspections go smoothly when drivers are organized with readily available information. And since electronic logbooks can alert drivers before they reach their HOS limit , drivers have ample time to plan, stop, and safely park mdash minimizing violations. How to edit driver logs and electronic logbooks Motive rsquo s electronic logbooks are designed for drivers, making day-to-day usage faster. That includes making it easy to identify and fill gaps in a driver rsquo s log . Fleet managers can view each driver rsquo s log , confirm any missing details with the driver, then update the electronic logbook to ensure the information is accurate and complete. nbsp For example, the Motive Driver App automatically prompts drivers to update any unsigned logs and unidentified driving events . And it rsquo s easy to insert a past duty status if a driver forgets to do so. nbsp Drivers can also keep driving time off their driver logs when allowed by FMCSA rules , such as yard moves or personal conveyance . This helps drivers ensure they don rsquo t exceed HOS limits while performing permitted activities. nbsp See what s new in the Driver App . How fleet managers can use driver logs to improve operations With better driver logs and electronic logbooks, fleet managers have the visibility they need to keep the entire fleet on track. The Motive Compliance Hub can reduce time spent on ELD compliance by up to 50 while helping reduce HOS violations by up to 50 . Together, the Compliance Hub and Fleet App can help you View driver logs and on-the-go duty status. Resolve form and manner errors. nbsp Spot vehicle and asset defects in inspection reports. nbsp Minimize violations by alerting drivers and managers before they occur. Identify which drivers need coaching to reduce their CSA scores. nbsp Gain visibility into trends over time, such as types of violations and driver behavior. Reduce the costs of violations. nbsp The Motive Compliance Hub uses AI to automatically match unidentified trips with recommended drivers and notify fleet managers of the recommendation, right in the Fleet Dashboard. This helps eliminate administrative time sorting through records. nbsp Similarly, fleets are now using data from driver logs and electronic logbooks to monitor CSA scores. Motive rsquo s fleet management solution can pair each driver rsquo s CSA score with Motive rsquo s Safety Score to fully understand each driver rsquo s risk profile. This helps fleet managers prioritize which drivers may benefit from safety coaching or reward top-performing drivers. What to know about driver log and electronic logbook rules and exemptions FMCSA first published the ELD mandate in 2015. Most carriers had to comply by December 2019. Canada rsquo s version took effect for federally regulated carriers on January 1, 2023. A few provinces are still phasing in enforcement for transport within their jurisdictions, while Alberta and Saskatchewan do not currently intend to add an ELD mandate to their own provincial regulations. nbsp The ELD mandate applies to most commercial motor vehicles involved in interstate commerce if they Weigh more than 10,001 pounds Transport hazardous materials in a quantity that requires placards Transport nine or more passengers for compensation Transport 16 or more passengers not for compensation A few ELD exemptions do exist . For example, drivers who operate on a ldquo short-haul rdquo basis within a 150-air-mile radius of their work reporting location do not need to comply. Drivers who complete eight or fewer long-haul jobs per month are also exempt from the ELD mandate, though they must still comply with record of duty status RODS requirements and log their hours manually or via an AOBRD. nbsp Vehicles manufactured before the 2000 model year are exempt from the ELD mandate and must log their RODS manually or via an AOBRD. ldquo Covered farm vehicles rdquo that haul agricultural machinery or supplies to or from a farm and ranch also have some exemptions, as do CMVs making emergency fuel deliveries or transporting materials to or from a Motion Picture Association of America-affiliated production site. nbsp Finally, Wisconsin and California do not currently require ELDs for intrastate commerce , but both states are in the process of drafting their own versions of the mandate. nbsp Simplify your driver logs and electronic logbooks to streamline compliance Electronic logbooks can unlock improved efficiency and productivity for your entire fleet.

            "Regular coaching as part of a fleet safety program helps build a safety culture and reinforces just how important safety is to your company. The results can pay off in fewer accidents, better driver retention, and even lower insurance costs . The most advanced fleet safety programs blend in-person, remote, and automated coaching. Combining all three leads to more frequent, proactive sessions that keep safety top-of-mind and help nip bad habits in the bud. nbsp As you build a comprehensive coaching and fleet safety program , make sure you start with executive buy-in. Executives need to support your efforts mdash and drivers need to know that coaching is a top organizational priority. If your leaders are hesitant to invest in a program, itemize the costs of not investing in a safety program. nbsp When you roll out the program to your fleet, explain why you rsquo re doing it. Create a safety contract or commitment letter for everyone to sign. And then continue to update the entire fleet on the program rsquo s successes and lessons. Who should be my fleet safety program coach? Designate at least one person as a dedicated driver coach. And don rsquo t just add ldquo run coaching program rdquo to an already-full plate. Ensure that your coach has enough time to do the program justice. nbsp Your ideal coach should Have the experience and authority to lead the coaching program. They could be a supervisor or a senior driver respected by their peers. Be a good listener, someone to whom drivers will feel comfortable admitting mistakes. nbsp Seek certification through a nationally recognized defensive driving program such as the National Private Truck Council NPTC or the Smith System . Depending on the size of your fleet, you may need more than one coach. Regardless, it rsquo s smart to designate a back-up in case your primary coach leaves or takes time off. nbsp And don rsquo t overlook the power of self-coaching . As part of your fleet safety program , empower your drivers to take ownership of their own actions and development by providing continual access to safety tips, videos, or other tools. nbsp Guidelines for effective coaching nbsp No matter where or when you rsquo re coaching , the basics are the same Have a plan nbsp For each session, draft a short agenda that will keep the conversation focused and ensure you rsquo re using your time wisely. Think about which one or two points you want to really drive home. Listen more than you talk nbsp Allow pauses to let your driver respond. Ask questions about their experiences, whether you rsquo re reviewing recent incidents or discussing new policies. Then listen to their answers before reacting. Assess whether a driver rsquo s skills or behaviors need improvement nbsp Sometimes a newer driver lacks skills that could be learned through a defensive driving course. Other times, bad habits are at fault. The difference is important. nbsp Establish common ground Even if it rsquo s a supervisor-employee relationship, you rsquo re on the same team, with the same goal to stay safe and do right by your customers. Make sure to emphasize how important this is in your overall fleet safety program. Make the costs of bad behaviors relatable Help drivers understand what their actions mean for the fleet and their own livelihood. Explain the rising costs of accidents, convictions, or nuclear verdicts mdash but also the risks of a suspended or revoked license. For example, commercial drivers with two serious traffic violations in three years face a minimum 60-day revocation , which increases to 120 days for a third violation. nbsp Share the positive, not just the negative Drivers who only hear negative feedback may grow discouraged and tune you out. Strive to share the positive, too. Point out how a driver rsquo s quick thinking averted a collision, or note how they improved a behavior . Consider rewarding desirable actions through a driver incentive program . Document each session Noting what was discussed in each session allows you to track progress, identify patterns, and demonstrate improvements to management, your team, or your insurance broker. nbsp This tracking is easy to do right in the Motive Driver App . nbsp Blend coaching methods While the most effective coaching tends to be in-person, that rsquo s not always practical. Weave in remote coaching via phone or video chat to reinforce your lessons, plus automated, self-directed coaching that can encourage your driver to continuously improve. Consider assigning training whether in-person or online , paired with assessments to confirm learning. You could also periodically distribute incident video and ask your drivers to be prepared to discuss it at your next team meeting. nbsp Invest in the right technology nbsp In-cab alerts from the Motive AI Dashcam can reinforce your coaching lessons right in the moment, when a real-time correction matters most. Additionally, drivers can review their own post-trip footage in the Motive Driver App. Motive also automatically scores incidents to identify the most severe events, helping you focus your coaching efforts. Stress that drivers can come to you, any time nbsp Keep an open-door policy. To build trust, tell drivers that they can reach out any time with questions or concerns, even if there rsquo s no coaching session scheduled. nbsp Track and reward success Set metrics that will reflect your efforts. Over time, share results with your entire team, and even your insurance carriers. Reward improvements and thank drivers for their efforts. Metrics might include Number of coachable events per million miles Accidents per million miles Average cost per claim Motive Safety Score Add coaching to your fleet safety program to see results Ready to get started?

            "Financial fraud costs organizations approximately 5 of their revenues annually. If that rsquo s true for your fleet fuel card spend, how much money are you losing? With the Motive Card rsquo s fraud control, and its new SMS unlock feature, you can cut the risk of fraudulent card transactions. Before we dive into how the Motive Card can reduce risk and help prevent fraud, we need to understand what a fleet fuel card is and why businesses choose to use them. What is a fleet fuel card? Fleet fuel cards are a popular way for businesses to allow drivers or other employees to purchase fuel on the road while getting discounts. Some also allow cardholders to pay for vehicle maintenance at accepted locations. You might also be able to make convenience store purchases or charge transactions at other merchants often within a pre-approved network . These cards are designed to cut operational inefficiency by simplifying fleet and fuel spend management . Unlike credit cards, fleet charge cards must be paid in full by the end of the billing cycle. nbsp Fleet cards can also contribute to employee retention by making it easier for cardholders to make purchases without having to file expense reports and wait for reimbursement at a later date. Boost security and reduce unauthorized spending with the the Motive Card. Cut your fraud risk You rsquo re probably familiar with the fraud prevention features of consumer credit cards, which help protect cardholders from the financial fallout due to lost or stolen cards, fraudulent purchases, and identity theft. Fleet cards often have similarprotection because fleets face many of the same challenges. A driver rsquo s card can be lost or stolen or a fleet manager may notice charges that seem out of place or potentially fraudulent. Fleets also battle fuel shrinkage a nicer way of saying theft . It rsquo s estimated that shrinkage accounts for between 5 and 10 of a fleet rsquo s annual consumption. That rsquo s a big hit when the national average for diesel fuel was 4.68 per gallon on February 1, 2023. Fleet cards can help managers catch fraudulent charges and shrinkage while reducing the time spent each week auditing outlier transactions to identify theft after the fact. Fleet cards like the Motive Card come with data-driven, proactive defenses mdash fraud detection and controls mdash to stop fuel theft before it happens. Adding Fraud Controls to the Motive Card We rsquo re always listening to our customers and evolving our products to better suit business needs. That rsquo s why we rsquo ve launched a new product feature to help secure your fleet fuel card transactions . With other cards, if the charge card falls into the wrong hands, and someone knows the PIN, they can make purchases. Motive adds a layer of card security by requiring the user to have their assigned phone plus identity verification via four-digit code in order to unlock the card. nbsp This additional text message security feature can help reduce fraud and unapproved spend. With only cardholders or fleet managers able to unlock cards with their assigned phone, unauthorized users can rsquo t make purchases without the card details, phone, and phone PIN verification. nbsp How it works Fleet administrators first enable Fraud controls for the Motive Cards in their fleet. Setup will require cardholder phone numbers. Once enabled, the Motive cards are locked by default and cardholders get notified that they now need to unlock their card before use. nbsp Before attempting purchases, the cardholder must send an SMS to Motive from their registered phone to unlock their card. Adding this layer of security requires physical Motive Card data as well as the cardholder rsquo s phone, helping us to validate the cardholders rsquo identity. Once cardholders verify their identity, the card will unlock and be available for transactions for the next 30 minutes, after which the card gets automatically locked. Connect fleet and spend management. Uncover new ways to save. Motive also helps simplify spend management with an all-in-one platform. Fleets of all sizes can maximize savings using discounts offered with your Motive Card, with diesel discounts averaging more than 20c gal at premier partners Love rsquo s and TA, and other big discounts at vendors like Casey rsquo s and Road Ranger. You can also enjoy discounts on maintenance and tires e.g. Boss Truck Shops, FlowBelow . Motive also boosts fleet fuel card security and reduces unauthorized spend by integrating spend management and fleet telematics data in a single platform. Managers can set up spend controls and detect fuel theft more easily. You can Compare purchased gallons with fuel level changes to make sure any fuel purchased goes into your vehicle. nbsp Review telematics GPS data against transaction location to identify potential fraud. nbsp Update limits and controls in real time to temporarily authorize one-off or emergency purchases. Additionally, the all-in-one view of fleet spend data helps optimize operations and save time by automating tasks like IFTA reporting in a few clicks. If you ever need support, you can reach a Motive product specialist 24 7. Fraud control security features help you protect your business and minimize financial risk.

            "The trucking industry is rebounding while softness in consumer demand continues to put pressure on retail nbsp Welcome to the March Motive Monthly Economic Report, where we break down the biggest supply chain and economic trends across the Motive platform over the last month. Motive serves over 120,000 customers who operate in the physical economy, from small businesses to Fortune 500 enterprises. Our customers power the North American supply chain mdash in construction, oil and gas, transportation and logistics, agriculture, distribution, and beyond. They rsquo re the people who grow our food, transport our materials, stock our stores, and pipe energy to our homes. Read on for your front-seat view into the factors that are moving the U.S. economy. nbsp The trucking industry is rebounding nbsp What rsquo s new Through February, trucking mileage maintained the strong start we saw in January , with a 10 increase in miles year-over-year. The supply chain is getting healthier amid steady reductions in transportation costs e.g., diesel prices and shorter lead times due to greater capacity in ocean and over-the-road freight. That said, we are still down 15 compared to the levels of activity seen in 2021. nbsp Why this matters A healthier supply chain is helping to ease inflation, however the January Jobs Report put unemployment at a generational low. January rsquo s Consumer Price Index CPI came in well above the Federal Reserve rsquo s 2 target, which will likely result in more short-term interest rate hikes later this month. New trucking registrations are up ndash a positive sign for freight job growth nbsp What rsquo s new A key indicator of freight market sentiment is new trucking company registrations. After almost 12 months of consecutive declines in registrations in 2022, we saw a reversal in February, with an over 30 increase in new company starts. This follows a more than 34 jump in January 2023 since the lows of December 2022. February added 9.5K new companies on a pro-rata basis, given that February has fewer working days. nbsp Pandemic highs Coming out of Covid, the demand for physical goods and services skyrocketed, leading to an unprecedented surge in new business formation and expansion of existing firms operating in the physical economy. April 2021-April 2022 saw new fleet creations climbing to historic highs, hitting a peak in July 2021 with over 15K new fleets registered 172 versus a 5.5K fleet average during Q4 of 2019. Economic lows This was followed by a stark reversal due to the changing economic environment in early 2022, with climbing inflation and transportation costs e.g., diesel prices driving new trucking company registrations down 47 in 2022. nbsp Why this matters The trucking industry has borne the brunt of changing economic tides in 2022, getting punished with high diesel prices, rapidly decreasing volumes, and drastic declines in operating margins. We ended Q4 2022 with historically high out of business rates exceeding what was seen during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and a net contraction in the number of freight companies. But a reversal in the trend shows early signs of optimism for small business job creation as 97 of registrations are from companies with 5 vehicles or fewer. nbsp Softness in consumer demand continues to put pressure on retail nbsp What rsquo s new We rsquo re still seeing a disconnect between supply chain health, increases in freight activity, and retail recovery. February has tracked January rsquo s trend of lower retail activity when compared to 2022, maintaining 10 lower activity in retail visits year-over-year and 15 less than in February 2021. Consistent hikes in interest rates from the Federal Reserve are having a real impact on consumer demand, as we saw with the cautious retail earnings and outlook last week . nbsp Why this matters Retailers aren rsquo t investing in inventory due to softness in consumer demand, and they rsquo re offering steep discounts to unload existing stock. Top retailers are being cautious as consumers cut spending therefore, we shouldn rsquo t expect substantial investments in retail inventory in the near-term. nbsp Data Methodology nbsp Motive data represents over 120,000 customers, half a million vehicles, and millions of drivers, from small businesses to enterprise fleets. Our customers work in every sector of the physical economy, including trucking and logistics, delivery, construction, food and beverage, oil and gas, and more. Motive rsquo s technology is embedded into more than 20 of for-hire trucks in North America, giving Motive a representative view of the over-the-road supply chain. Indexes Breakdown nbsp Motive rsquo s Freight Weekly Mileage Index is calculated by the distance traveled for trucks with Motive technology embedded. Motive rsquo s Retail Visits Index is measured by truck visits to top retailers rsquo warehouse with Motive technology embedded. Motive rsquo s Interstate New Fleet Registrations reflect new companies registering for interstate activity. This typically covers the market of long-distance trucking that is dominant in the transportation of most goods in North America.\n",

            "As contractors have increased investment in digital solutions, they rsquo ve entered the realm of continuous learning. It rsquo s a realm where feedback is immediate and training never stops. The goal of training is to improve fleet safety and instill better habits. But developing safer habits has never been easy when reinforcement comes sporadically, if at all. The digital age has left sporadic training behind in favor of something more ldquo accessible and always on . rdquo Through automation, today rsquo s operators are immersed in real-time feedback that takes them to the next level of safety. nbsp When safety training is automated, learning takes place exactly when it rsquo s needed. So that risk is reduced and accidents prevented. In professions like construction and commercial transportation, where one mistake can cost workers their life, the value of accident prevention through fleet safety training can rsquo t be overstated. What is continuous learning? Continuous learning is the ongoing expansion of knowledge and skills . Across the physical economy, ongoing training helps fleet drivers and equipment operators develop new skills while reinforcing positive behaviors they rsquo ve already learned. Where traditional training involves learning before doing, continuous learning involves learning by doing. Popular forms include Conferences Certification programs Professional development workshops ldquo Toolbox talks rdquo Mentorship programs nbsp Weekly training seminars Ongoing fleet safety training in all forms has value. But digital-based training delivers something other styles can rsquo t Timely feedback. The timely power of AI and automation Automated technologies powered by artificial intelligence AI provide the right learnings at just the right time. It rsquo s why they prevent accidents so efficiently. According to one insurance broker, virtually any company can benefit from the real-time protection AI tools provide. And ldquo businesses with physically intense operations mdash such as construction, transportation, warehousing, and farming mdash may see the greatest benefits. rdquo As the construction industry moves deeper into digital transformation , contractors are putting learning and development at the forefront. To stay competitive, they have to. In a recent Deloitte Autodesk study , more than 1,100 participants said construction firms should emphasize the importance of continuous learning . Respondents also said they want to work where continuous learning is valued. Faced with a years-long labor shortage , there rsquo s an opportunity here for firms to attract new talent . In the high-risk professions that power the physical economy, AI has turned continuous learning into real-time improvement. Automated driver coaching has played a big part in that. By detecting and alerting to driving-related hazards as they emerge, AI prevents injury and saves lives. The more accurate the AI, the safer the results . Continuous learning, safer results With the many hazards on construction sites , it s easy to forget that construction vehicles pose a considerable risk to workers. Between collisions and rollovers, backing accidents and cargo spills, workers are always vulnerable to injury, whether en route to the jobsite or on it. That rsquo s where AI dash cams like the one from Motive can help. In-cab alerts generated by artificial intelligence prompt vehicle operators to recognize unsafe driving habits and correct them in real time. Before an accident occurs. Self-coaching tips are automatically sent to drivers through the Motive Driver App, allowing operators to improve without manager intervention. This proactive approach to fleet safety is a big change from the past, when driver coaching sessions took place in-person and only after an unsafe incident had occurred. Drivers dreaded the in-person chats, feeling blamed for close following and other unsafe habits they weren rsquo t even conscious of. nbsp In-cab alerts and automation are changing all of that. Today rsquo s AI dash cams empower drivers to develop safe habits on the spot, and on their own. In-cab alerts sharpen operator awareness and protect workers proactively in their most vulnerable moments. App-based coaching is much more efficient than the old way of doing things as well. Lasting benefits of continuous learning Enhanced fleet safety is the main benefit of continuous learning, but there are others. Such as 1. Improved productivity Automated driver coaching and other forms of continuous learning lead to the growth of individuals. As operators shed the unsafe habits of the past, they rsquo re less inclined to make similar mistakes in the future. Safe behavior is productive behavior, both for the operator and the vehicle. nbsp In preventing accidents, continuous learning prevents the injuries and vehicle downtime associated with them. For contractors, that means fewer days away or restricted and more time actually working. With craft workers hard to come by, the last thing construction firms need is for their existing teams to be out with injury. It rsquo s one more reason to invest in digital. When training is continuous, productivity is too. 2. Better job satisfaction. nbsp Few things are as empowering as developing a new skill or being recognized for a job well done . When workers excel in fleet safety , they become part of a special fraternity that is Best in Class. Enhanced performance improves operators rsquo confidence, making them feel more capable. Reward operators for improvement and their sense of satisfaction will grow. 3. Greater retention. nbsp If improving fleet safety increases employee satisfaction, it also leads to higher retention . When operators are satisfied with their jobs, they stay. Continuous training and the learning that comes with it empowers contractors to make better decisions. The fulfillment they get from enhancing their skills will motivate them to reach future milestones. Even struggling operators improve when backed by technologies that support their growth. So you can keep them on the payroll, too. 4. Better profitability. nbsp Fewer accidents and more productive employees will make your business more profitable. The safer an employee rsquo s driving behaviors, the better they can protect themselves and the vehicle. In the absence of collisions, workers can arrive at the jobsite on time and at full capacity. Not to mention, a better safety record can help you win better rates and more business. Together, these elements can enhance your reputation and strengthen your bottom line.

            "For nearly a decade, our focus has been on helping our customers proactively manage safety with artificial intelligence AI that really works. That rsquo s why we built the Motive AI Dashcam , which detects unsafe driving behavior with unrivaled accuracy and alerts drivers in real time through state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms and a leading-edge AI processor. nbsp We see the positive impact in the latest 2023 safety results from the Motive platform. Compared to all active fleets, fleets with Motive AI Dashcams across the majority of their vehicles, and that frequently coach drivers, experienced up to 80 fewer accidents. These fleets had an average of 50 fewer accidents with the help of coaching. These are severe crashes reported by the FMCSA and involve towaways, injuries, or fatalities. The 600 active fleets included in the study covered nearly 100K drivers. But we rsquo re always focused on getting better. We combine a data-driven process for collecting, labeling, and improving AI model performance with best-in-class hardware to help keep the roads safer for everyone. Let rsquo s take a closer look at how our newest AI capabilities take safety performance to the next level. Advanced collision detection nbsp Safety managers need to know quickly when accidents occur so they can get onsite help for their drivers and kick off the insurance claims process. Real-time accident alerts with video help managers take immediate action, minimize loss, and protect drivers. They can also forward footage of the incident to drivers that can provide on-the-spot exoneration and evidence in the case of litigation. Our collision model proactively catches over 99 of the highest severity collisions, such as rollovers and jack-knifes, while swiftly identifying minor events like fender benders and object hits. New telematics data like rollover protection, airbag deployment, and other crash indicators also improve the accuracy of collision detection. HD video is uploaded within 90 seconds of an accident, and managers receive an alert with the video and detailed collision report. Accurately detecting collisions with supporting video is important, since false positives can be disruptive and costly to commercial fleets. Our AI model is trained on over 10,000 collisions and regularly updated with insights from support requests and recalled footage. nbsp Stop sign violation Rolling stops are frequently ticketed and are one of the leading causes of fatal fleet accidents on local roads, endangering pedestrians, bicyclists, and other vehicles. Drivers with a violation for failure to obey traffic signs are 68 more likely to have a future crash. When approaching a stop sign, the AI Dashcam detects and alerts the driver when they don rsquo t reduce their speed below 6 mph within 7 seconds of the stop sign disappearing from view. nbsp Driver distraction According to the NHTSA, distracted driving claimed 3,142 lives in 2020. Paying attention to the road is crucial to staying safe. The AI Dashcam detects and alerts the driver when they continuously look down for more than 5 seconds while driving faster than 10 mph. They might be looking down due to drowsiness, cell phone use, smoking, eating, or general inattentiveness. nbsp Unsafe lane change A prior conviction for an unsafe lane change increases the likelihood of a fleet accident by 80 and adds up to 5 points to your CSA score after a violation. The AI Dashcam detects and alerts the driver when they unsafely switch lanes above 30 mph while tailgating before and or after the lane change. nbsp Camera obstruction The AI Dashcam requires a clear view of the road and driver to avoid missing any unsafe driving events. An obstructed camera can also miss out on critical exoneration evidence. The AI Dashcam instantly detects when the camera is obstructed at least 60-80 on the road- or driver-facing lenses and alerts drivers and managers to resolve the issue and ensure proper camera visibility. nbsp With the help of AI technology, we hope to see fewer accidents, safer roads, and more lives saved.

            "Like so many other things, fleet insurance costs have soared in the last few years. According to the American Transportation Research Institute ATRI , premium costs per mile have risen 47 in the last decade , climbing from 5.9 cents to 8.7 cents. A combination of accident rates, higher repair costs, and litigation have created a challenging environment for both fleets and insurers. nbsp As a result, Sentry mdash which insures more than 48,000 units throughout the United States mdash has been working closely with customers to help them manage risks, and in turn, control costs. We recently spoke with Daniel Grant and Brad Schneider from Sentry to learn more, including how Motive and Sentry customers can use AI dash cams to lower their rates. What rsquo s driving up fleet insurance costs? Higher fleet insurance costs are partially the result of ldquo nuclear verdicts, rdquo as multimillion-dollar judgments against motor carriers are handed down more frequently. In 2021, a Florida jury awarded a landmark 1 billion verdict in a wrongful death case involving two trucking fleets. Even if money is never collected in the case, the judgment shows that juries believe huge rewards like these are warranted. Questionable tactics like the ldquo reptile theory rdquo are driving up fleet insurance costs, too. Trial lawyers play on jurors rsquo emotions to award excessive judgments to the plaintiff. Other times, they pressure insurers to put up policy limits of 1 million or more, even when fault has yet to be determined. And if they don rsquo t? nbsp ldquo The window to negotiate a settlement may close, and we may be faced with a demand or judgment well above the policy limits, rdquo says Grant, Sentry rsquo s Corporate Director, Safety and Loss Control Services. Want to learn how to save more on insurance? Hear from industry experts in our new guide. As claim costs grow, insurers are exiting the commercial fleet market altogether. Those remaining are becoming more selective about the fleets they insure. The decline in insurers is driving up rates, along with nuclear verdicts, accident costs, and inflation. ldquo When one of our insureds gets into an accident and has vehicle damage, it will cost significantly more to fix compared to just a few years ago, rdquo Grant says. ldquo Additionally, it may take much longer to repair, due to ongoing part shortages. With thousands of accidents a year, insurers have to pass on a portion of unexpected costs through increased premiums. rdquo Fleet insurance costs are increasing in all sectors According to ATRI , almost all motor carriers experienced substantial increases in fleet insurance costs between 2018 and 2020, despite higher deductibles and improved safety. ldquo Premiums increased across all fleet sizes and sectors, with small fleets paying more than three times as much as very large fleets on a per-mile basis, rdquo Heavy Duty Trucking notes. nbsp ldquo After an accident, it rsquo s expensive to put people and vehicles back together again, rdquo explains Schneider, Sentry rsquo s Director of Underwriting, Transportation. ldquo In addition to physical damage from an accident, medical costs to cover bodily injury have skyrocketed. When a truck is involved in an accident, it rsquo s expensive. Themes like these are putting pressure on the trucking industry, creating a costlier environment. rdquo Higher premiums get passed along to consumers in the form of pricier goods and services. As a result, fleets are paying more for used vehicles, repairs, parts, fuel, and so much else. ldquo For the last few years, fleets have been dealing with an increase in costs , from fuel to maintenance to equipment, rdquo Schneider says. ldquo They rsquo re paying more to hire and retain drivers, and to keep their vehicles moving. Customers keep asking, lsquo Are fleet insurance costs coming down at some point? rsquo But inflationary pressures are still out there, and that rsquo s keeping premiums high. rdquo In this environment, the exoneration power of AI dash cams is more valuable than ever. Even aggressive legal tactics are no match for the power of video. AI dash cams are a strategic tool, especially for commercial fleets and drivers. In fact, the AI dash cam may be fleets rsquo greatest hope for driving down insurance costs. Here rsquo s how to go about it. Invest in AI dash cams to earn insurance discounts To help drive safety and lower costs through telematics, Motive and Sentry Insurance have partnered to incentivize customers with lower insurance premiums . Customers who use Motive rsquo s Driver Safety Solution can see insurance premium savings of up to 5 when they share their Vehicle Gateway-captured telematics data with Sentry. For large fleets, a 5 cut in insurance rates can save 10,000 or more. In addition to insurance savings, fleets could experience a reduction in accident frequency, further enhancing their ROI. This exclusive benefit for Motive-Sentry customers puts fleets in position to reduce risk and lower their rates. Customers who take advantage of the insurance discounts will share their ELD and AI dash cam data with Sentry. Sentry will then be able to analyze the data and understand the connection between fleet safety performance and risk levels over time. nbsp ldquo We use CSA scores and loss information to analyze safety and compliance trends, rdquo Grant says. ldquo Understanding these trends gives us a more accurate picture of fleet risk. We rsquo ll be able to determine which fleets are performing well and which have room for improvement. rdquo Use AI dash cams to coach drivers and prevent accidents Fleets that make AI dash cams and driver coaching part of an integrated risk management strategy are earning lower insurance rates. nbsp ldquo Just having AI dash cams doesn rsquo t mean you rsquo ll improve safety performance, rdquo Grant says. Fleets see the best results when they use AI dash cams to coach drivers to improve. It rsquo s important, however, to have a foundational safety management program already in place. AI dash cams, like the one Motive offers, can be used to proactively coach drivers in a few ways. For example, whenever a rolling stop or cell phone event occurs, in-cab alerts prompt the driver to correct the unsafe behavior as quickly as it happens. That means the driver can correct unsafe habits in real time, before an accident occurs. Through the Motive Driver App , self-coaching tips are automatically sent to the driver, allowing them to review the tips on their own mdash without manager intervention. If an event captured by the Motive AI Dashcam warrants more discussion, fleets can reinforce positive driving behaviors during an in-person coaching session . nbsp ldquo Companies looking to lower fleet insurance costs must first lower their accident rates mdash nbsp and coaching is a great way to do that, rdquo Schneider says. Motive data shows that AI dash cam customers who frequently coach experienced an average of 50 fewer accidents , and up to 80 fewer accidents, than those who don rsquo t coach. nbsp ldquo An AI dash cam reveals who rsquo s driving risk in your fleet, but you can rsquo t just set it and forget it, rdquo Schneider cautions. ldquo Installing AI dash cams and not coaching drivers to improve, not having driver meetings or a thorough onboarding process, will lead to disappointing results. rdquo As an insurance provider, Sentry rewards fleets that improve safety performance over time. Fortunately for Motive customers, the Safety Score makes it easy to spot safety improvement over time. One glance at the Safety Score, displayed prominently in the Motive Fleet Dashboard, and you can see if fleet safety is improving or declining. nbsp Motive rsquo s 2023 State of Safety Report showed a direct correlation between driver safety programs and insurance savings. Forty-four percent of organizations with driver safety programs reduced their insurance costs. ldquo For the fleets experiencing lower accident frequency, it rsquo s usually an indicator that they rsquo re managing safety really well, rdquo Grant explains. ldquo For us, that rsquo s a sign that the insured is addressing their own risks. Those are the fleets we want to do business with. Those are the fleets who enjoy lower rates. rdquo Use AI dash cams to exonerate drivers from liability For commercial fleets, avoiding a big claim isn rsquo t easy, even when the commercial driver is innocent. Since commercial drivers have the larger vehicles, they rsquo re often assumed to be at fault in an accident. Passenger car drivers often see an opportunity to make money from fleets with ldquo deep pockets. rdquo In light of this trend, fleets should protect themselves with AI dash cams. ldquo When you have video evidence showing your driver isn rsquo t at fault, it can eliminate or reduce any payout, potentially saving millions, rdquo Schneider says. ldquo Having AI dash cam footage in your corner clears up any question about who rsquo s at fault. You have recorded video that shows, indisputably, that your driver isn rsquo t to blame. As AI dash cams exonerate more commercial drivers, the greatest savings will come from the payouts that fleets don rsquo t have to make. rdquo Even if the dash cam shows your driver is at fault, ldquo there rsquo s still a large savings from a claims handling standpoint, rdquo Schneider says. ldquo Less investigative work is required, and the claim gets resolved faster. rdquo As drivers see firsthand how AI dash cams exonerate them from wrongful blame, their acceptance of dash cams is growing. nbsp ldquo Drivers have become more comfortable with having AI dash cams in their vehicles, rdquo Grant says. ldquo If you look back six or seven years ago, fleets had a much harder time convincing drivers that dash cams support them. Now drivers are seeing how AI dash cams protect their reputation and help them advance in their careers. rdquo About Sentry Sentry insures more than 7,000 trucking customers and 48,000 units.

            "As part of its ongoing effort to save lives and prevent injuries, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association FMCSA introduced an electronic logging device ELD mandate. Now, five years after the mandate rsquo s implementation, we have the ability to report the full benefits and features of ELDs for trucks . nbsp An ELD that complies with the mandate will record the date, time, location, engine hours, miles driven, identification information, engine power and vehicle motion status, as well as driver duty status. All this data is logged automatically at least every 60 minutes. nbsp Benefits of installing an ELD in your trucks An ELD is a hardware device that connects to a vehicle rsquo s engine electronic control module ECM and pairs with a display to help keep drivers on track and compliant. This can also improve safety, help reduce insurance premiums, and cut overall fleet costs. We rsquo ll talk in more detail about each of the benefits of ELDs for trucks next. Simplify fleet compliance An ELD for trucks automatically tracks a driver rsquo s driving time and keeps the record of duty status RODS . With the ELD monitoring the driver rsquo s driving time and hours-of-service HOS compliance, it rsquo s much easier to have accurate records and ensure efficient communication of the data fleet managers need for compliance reporting. Reviewing five years of data , researchers at the Supply Chain Management Research Center at the University of Arkansas U of A concluded the ELD mandate ldquo significantly improved driver compliance with reporting hours of service. rdquo Small carriers and independent owner-operators, in particular, benefited from moving away from paper based reporting. According to TruckingInfo rsquo s coverage of the U of A study, Pre-ELDs, the vast majority of hours-of-service citations were for lsquo form and manner rsquo violations those have virtually disappeared. rdquo Streamline operations With the elimination of paperwork in favor of digital data, you can simplify communication between drivers and fleet managers. This can also reduce administrative burdens, which frees up your drivers and the people in the back office for other important work. An ELD integration with your fleet management software can also improve other operation areas. For example, you can automate IFTA fuel tax reporting to improve efficiency while also reducing risks of human error tracking the distance a vehicle travels in each IFTA jurisdiction every day. Or, having the ELD require drivers to examine unidentified trips and either claim them or indicate that they aren rsquo t attributable to them can facilitate reporting as well. Reduce fleet costs Electronic logging for trucks supports more efficient routing. This helps fleets save on fuel costs. For example, an idle-time tracker feature can help with fuel management while reducing your fleet rsquo s environmental impact. At the same time, saving time on dispatch means you can optimize routes to get the most from the trucks you have on the road. You can also simplify and automate vehicle maintenance with the ELD connection to the ECM in each truck. This can help you avoid costly downtime by performing preventative maintenance to keep your fleet vehicles in service longer. ELDs for trucks in your fleet can also help improve Compliance, Safety, and Accountability scores, which can bring insurance savings. Some insurance companies provide cost-saving plans and offer increased benefits for fleets using nbsp ELDs . nbsp Expedite inspections Inspections are a necessary part of truck driving, but drivers want them to be over and done with as quickly as possible.

            "Technology is transforming the transportation industry by enabling fleet optimization and improving efficiency and driver safety. One powerful tool that rsquo s helping fleets? Truck dash cams. They add a level of safety while improving driver experience and making fleet management easier. This article discusses the many benefits of dash cams for trucks and examines what to look for, legal considerations, and how to make the most of your truck dash cam technology. Truck dash cam basics nbsp Dash cams have been around nearly a century. As early as 1939 , you can find Popular Science coverage of a police officer with a camera on his dashboard. The cameras became increasingly common for law enforcement after the 1960s. Then, as the technology became more compact and affordable, the applications broadened. Dash cameras for trucks can improve driver safety, lower costs , and help fleets work more efficiently. Often installed on the truck or semi-truck rsquo s dashboard or windshield, dash cams are road-facing, driver-facing, or you can get dual-facing dash cams that record the road and the driver. These small video cameras are typically powered by the vehicle rsquo s electrical systems. They might turn on automatically when the ignition is started or be manually turned on and off by drivers or fleet managers. Read Introducing the AI fleet dash cam that will help you see more. Benefits of dash cameras for trucks nbsp Dash cams in trucks can give safety and fleet managers more visibility into overall fleet safety . Integrating dash cam video with fleet management software gives managers insight into driver behaviors such as hard braking, hard cornering, rapid acceleration, or speeding. Dash cam video is commonly used in the trucking industry to reveal what happened before, during, and after any incidents on the road. The truck dash camera footage can help you avoid the risk of relying on human memory or inaccurate and conflicting stories. nbsp Video helps authorities in understanding who rsquo s at fault in an accident. Additionally, insurance companies and courts can use the dash cam footage to determine who should pay damages and how much. For fleets, video of an incident may also be used to exonerate drivers and avoid nuclear verdicts. California-based Nybll , for example, benefitted from Motive dash cam technology when one of its drivers was involved in a collision. Recorded footage proved the driver wasn rsquo t at fault, which exonerated him and saved the company an estimated 500,000. Having a dash cam in your trucks can also lower your insurance costs. Having dash cam footage helps protect your drivers rsquo motor vehicle records, which can lower rates . Truck dash cameras also support your fleet rsquo s culture of safety. Video is often used to coach drivers to improve performance. Drivers are also more motivated to follow the rules and best practices, knowing they are recorded on video. Additionally, you can use the dash cam footage, combined with other fleet management metrics, to recognize and reward your safest commercial drivers. Advantages of AI-powered dash cameras for trucks Dash cams that use artificial intelligence AI are a more recent innovation offering even more benefits. AI dash cams for trucks use real-time data to analyze road conditions and driver behavior. nbsp These cameras can help reduce distracted driving and prevent accidents. Combining the processing power of AI and advanced computer vision algorithms, these powerful dash cams can detect unsafe driving behaviors and notify drivers of risk. In-cab audio and visual alerts can warn the driver against speeding or close following so that they will change their behavior when it matters most mdash while they rsquo re on the road. nbsp At the same time, AI analysis of dash-cam footage can help fleets to focus their coaching and training efforts. With the dash cam view, those doing the training can see the same thing that drivers see. So, even when you rsquo re not on the road with your drivers, you can review dash cam footage together and address unsafe driver habits. nbsp Key features to look for in truck dash cameras There are several factors to consider when selecting the right dash cams for truckers or semi-trucks. We rsquo ll discuss some of the main ones in this section. File storage You rsquo ll want to investigate both how the dash cam footage is stored and for how long. Typically you rsquo ll be choosing between cloud storage and memory card or micro SD card . While cloud storage can generally hold a high volume of footage, with memory cards you rsquo ll be limited by the specific capacity of that storage. Connecting your dash camera video recordings to the cloud also removes the need to manually retrieve your footage. The Internet-connected truck dash cam can be set up to back up on a consistent schedule. Drivers may also send important videos to the back office when they need. Video quality You rsquo ll want to be able to see clearly what is happening on the road, or both on the road and in the cab with a dual-facing option . Video resolution will play a role in your ability to identify people and objects in the clips you review. Truck dash cams with a wide dynamic range WDR and wide-angle lens offering HD resolutions can help you see important details. Smart features As dash cam technology evolves, you can also look for smart features that can make coaching and other operational activities easier. You might seek out an offering that provides GPS data integration to provide additional context. Reporting capabilities. ELD integration. Combining AI footage with analytical interpretation, you can detect upcoming route complications, reroute vehicles to alternative routes, and better understand driving patterns and how they impact fuel consumption and vehicle performance. nbsp Accuracy When it comes to accident prevention and road safety, dash cam accuracy is critical. In an independent evaluation by leading research firm nbsp Strategy Analytics , the nbsp Motive AI Dashcam nbsp outperformed other leading dash cams. In 342 separate tests under daytime, dusk, and nighttime conditions, the Motive AI Dashcam successfully detected unsafe driving behavior 89 of the time, higher than Lytx 61 and Samsara 15 . Ease of installation Your investment in this technology will only pay off if your drivers can easily set up and install the dash cams. You rsquo ll encounter dashboard cameras that use adhesives or suction cups. Quick and secure adhesive options are often a good choice. Legal considerations for truck dash cams When installing dash cameras in trucks, you rsquo ll want to do some research to ensure you comply with federal and state laws. At the federal level, driver-facing dash cams are allowed, but as there are restrictions on recording someone rsquo s voice or image without their consent, fleets must let employees know how they rsquo re using these dash cams. At the state level, there will be different requirements. You will need to look into the legality of the cameras and whether there are rules about where cameras can be placed. This useful resource gives state-by-state summaries of the regulations for dash cams in trucks . Drivers may also resist installing dash cams in their trucks. If that rsquo s the case, be sure to review best practices to encourage their buy in. It also helps to select a dash cam that supports driver privacy. For example, the Motive AI Dashcam gives drivers the option to disable the driver-facing camera while they rsquo re off duty. nbsp Installation and Maintenance of truck dash cameras When installing a truck dash camera properly , you rsquo ll want to first find the best position. Typically this is the top center of the windshield or to the side of the rearview mirror. You do not want to obscure the driver rsquo s view. Clean the windshield of debris before applying the dash cam. Then, after pressing the camera to the windshield for at least 15 seconds, check that you have a strong connection. Next, ensure the camera is positioned correctly and functioning properly.

            "Risky fleet driver behaviors occur all too often. But some of the riskiest habits can serve as warning signs of future incidents. If you pay attention to these warnings, you can take steps to improve driver behavior and your fleet rsquo s safety . nbsp The American Transportation Research Institute ATRI recently released an updated version of its Predicting Truck Crash Involvement research . ATRI analyzed more than 580,000 individual truck driver records and identified 25 different violations and convictions that can predict the likelihood of future crashes. In fact, fleet drivers who committed the five riskiest behaviors increased their likelihood of a future crash by more than 100 . nbsp And since 2005, ATRI has found that these behaviors continue to grow even more predictive. For example, the 2022 report found that drivers with a previous crash were 113 more likely to have a future crash mdash a rise of 28.4 since 2018. nbsp However, artificial intelligence AI can accurately identify these risky behaviors to help fleet managers know when coaching is required. AI-driven in-cab alerts can even prompt drivers to make immediate corrections. nbsp Build an AI-driven fleet safety program. Explore free resources. AI becomes even more powerful when paired with a comprehensive coaching program. In fact, a recent Motive study found that fleets using Motive rsquo s AI-powered dash cams and frequent coaching had 22 fewer accidents and 56 fewer safety incidents. Today, fleets are blending advanced AI with coaching to improve driver behavior, reduce risks, and improve overall fleet safety . nbsp ATRI rsquo s five riskiest behaviors nbsp Based on ATRI rsquo s most recent data, the five riskiest behaviors in terms of future crash probability are Failure to yield right-of-way violation nbsp Failure to use improper signal conviction nbsp Prior crash nbsp Reckless driving violation nbsp Failure to obey traffic sign conviction nbsp For example, a fleet driver with a failure to yield right-of-way violation has a 141 greater likelihood of a future crash. nbsp However, ATRI also finds that over 93 of the 583,805 drivers analyzed were not involved in any crashes during the two-year reporting period. This indicates that if fleet managers can identify which drivers most need coaching, carefully targeted efforts can improve the safety of the entire fleet . nbsp How AI can help reduce risky fleet driver behaviors AI can help identify which drivers are at risk for exhibiting behaviors that put them in jeopardy. nbsp Motive rsquo s AI Dashcam, known for its accuracy , can detect unsafe behaviors and alert drivers to modify their behaviors in real time. nbsp Use video to identify risky fleet driver behaviors The Motive Fleet Dashboard automatically prioritizes each video event, helping managers cut through the noise and focus on the most serious incidents. With full safety context provided on each video, managers can easily identify behaviors that put their fleet at risk without manually reviewing hours of video footage. nbsp Dash cam footage can be a great tool for coaching your fleet drivers. It rsquo s one thing to tell someone they made a mistake it rsquo s another to show them how dangerous the situation could have become. nbsp Exonerate fleet drivers Dash cam footage can also exonerate drivers when they rsquo re falsely accused of causing an accident. D amp A McRae, Inc was able to use footage from the Motive AI Dashcam to prove that a collision occurred when their driver was cut off by another truck changing lanes. When law enforcement reviewed the footage, they saw what really happened. nbsp ldquo Footage from Motive rsquo s Smart Dashcam exonerated our driver on the spot and saved us what could have been close to 50K in damages, rdquo terminal manager Rod Conrad says. The footage also saved the company legal headaches and a hit to the driver rsquo s CSA score. Send in-cab alerts The Motive AI Dashcam can also provide in-cab alerts that instantly notify drivers to keep their eyes on the road, increase their following distance , or take other actions. By correcting behaviors in the moment, drivers are more likely to learn from their mistakes. Score driving behaviors Finally, AI can aggregate trends by driver or fleet. Motive rsquo s proprietary DRIVE risk score weighs behavior across Motive rsquo s network of 550,000 fleet drivers to provide an objective measure of each driver rsquo s risk. Over time, you can use the DRIVE score to track the impact of your driver coaching. Share this data with your manager and fleet to celebrate team wins mdash or with your insurance broker when it rsquo s time to negotiate rates. nbsp For example, Tri-Pol Enterprises was facing a 45 increase in their insurance premium rates. When safety manager Stacy Hill reviewed Tri-Pol rsquo s Motive data, he was able to demonstrate a decrease in harsh braking events and other dangerous driving behaviors. The insurance company relented and cut the rate increase to just 17 . nbsp How AI can support a safety coaching program A comprehensive safety coaching program can strengthen your safety culture . With executive buy-in, a coaching program provides a framework to help fleet drivers continuously improve their behaviors, identify and learn missing skills, and reduce overall risk. The most effective safety coaching programs have three elements in-person, remote, and automated. AI can help identify and prioritize the behaviors that need coaching. The video footage generated by AI dash cams makes it easier to show behaviors, while Motive rsquo s automated coaching includes in-cab alerts and reminders to continuously reinforce lessons. This AI-driven automated coaching also gives drivers more autonomy and privacy , allowing them to review their own footage. nbsp Let AI start helping you improve your fleet rsquo s safety Ready to see how AI can help you advance your own safety initiatives?

            "One safety expert shows how simple it can be. Most of us go out of our way to avoid difficult conversations. Just thinking about it can make the heart race and body tighten up. And if avoidance is uncomfortable, it rsquo s also unhealthy . nbsp The stakes of avoidance are even higher in careers like construction, where failing to address safety lapses can have catastrophic outcomes for workers and profits. Monica Rakoczy has made safety her business. As the owner of EnterTRAINING Solutions , she uses real-life scenarios to engage workers in fleet safety. As a featured speaker at ConExpo this year, she spread her message that safety conversations don rsquo t have to be difficult . Guided by data, they can be downright positive. nbsp Monica Rakoczy, owner of EnterTRAINING Solutions. The next time you have to have a difficult conversation with an operator, follow Rakoczy rsquo s advice below for the most positive results. Keep an open mind For fleets that use AI dash cams , there rsquo s a benefit to the real-time alerts that stop unsafe driving in its tracks. But how can you use AI dash cam footage to coach operators to improve? Before meeting with the operator, review the footage from the AI dash cam at least twice, then contemplate questions that can help you stay objective . Ask yourself Is unsafe behavior out of character for this operator? Why might they have been speeding or following too closely? Are they under a lot of pressure? By assuming the operator has good intentions, your tone will be positive going into the discussion. Coaching conversations don rsquo t have to last long, and for the best results, they shouldn rsquo t. nbsp Make the most of your time by preparing for the discussion beforehand. Review the operator rsquo s safety history for trends. Jot down points you want to discuss. And if you have big concerns, consult a colleague for an unbiased opinion on behaviors shown in the dash cam video. Make operators feel safe ldquo If you can rsquo t make team members feel safe in conversation, how can you inspire them to drive safely on the road? rdquo Rakoczy asks. ldquo By putting yourself at ease, you rsquo ll put operators at ease. Relax, soften your tone, and note how the operator softens, too. rdquo To make the dialogue more positive from the start, approach fleet safety coaching as a mentoring opportunity . ldquo Remember, we rsquo re not safety cops, we rsquo re safety mentors, rdquo Rakoczy says. ldquo We need to get away from thinking of safety as policing and understand that it rsquo s really about coaching . With a more human approach, our discussions will become much more open and productive. rdquo Use AI dash cam footage to guide the conversation ldquo Technology is great. Where it has brought us is incredible, but technology is at its best when we use it to enrich relationships, rdquo Rakoczy says. nbsp Dash cam clips generated by AI dash cams can be especially helpful in driving the conversation with your operators. Video captured by dual-facing AI dash cams shows exactly where the operator rsquo s attention was focused when an unsafe event occurred. nbsp Was the operator looking down at their phone? Reaching for something in the vehicle? Discussing these details while watching the video together will keep the conversation focused and impactful. Let the operator tell you what they see in the video. nbsp Having them narrate will make them more aware of their actions in the future. It will also make fleet safety coaching more of a conversation. If an operator is stressed about something, those details should come out in the coaching session, allowing you to build the relationship. ldquo Use the dash cam clip as a tool to connect on a deeper level, rdquo Rakoczy advises. ldquo You could say, lsquo How does seeing that behavior make you feel? rsquo or lsquo Tell me more about that. rsquo You rsquo ll make the most progress on safety by acknowledging the person behind the job. rdquo Listen, reflect, observe Active listening plays a huge role in understanding an operator rsquo s motivation. The better you understand your team, the easier communicating with them will be. Rakoczy encourages coaches to practice the 60 40 rule Listen 60 of the time, talk 40 of the time. nbsp ldquo The better you listen, the better you can appreciate outside stresses that may be causing the operator to perform unsafely, rdquo she says. ldquo Having that insight will help you address any safety issues more directly and prevent similar incidents from happening. rdquo Create a positive outcome nbsp If you go into the fleet safety coaching session thinking ldquo this is going to be tough, rdquo it probably will be. Instead, go in believing the coaching session will produce positive results. Focus on immediate and long-term goals the discussion can create for the operator, and have confidence those goals will be achieved. ldquo When your attention is focused on positive outcomes and benefits, it will shift your thinking process and inner dialogue to a more constructive place , rdquo the Harvard Business Review writes. ldquo As a result, you rsquo ll grow more comfortable approaching the coworker who constantly criticizes and complains, or the subordinate who keeps underperforming. rdquo Agree on next steps In closing out the fleet safety coaching session, be clear about what action items you and the operator are agreeing to. Get a firm commitment about next steps and what the operator is responsible for going forward. You could Use statements such as ldquo Just to make sure we rsquo re on the same page rdquo or ldquo Let rsquo s review what we rsquo ve just agreed to. rdquo Confirm what the next steps should be. End by thanking the operator and letting them know they rsquo re a valuable member of the team. nbsp Allowing the operator to take responsibility for unsafe driving behaviors will make them less likely to repeat the same behaviors going forward. By ending the session with clarity and accountability, you rsquo ll correct any misunderstandings between yourself and the operator. Read Motive and Platform Science partner to enhance fleet safety .

            "Turning on lights at night is a no-brainer. We even signal to other drivers to do so, helping to keep the roadway safe. Yet there are also many additional daytime running light DRL benefits. Depending on where you rsquo re driving, you may also be required to have your daytime running lights on while operating your vehicle. This blog discusses DRLs, the reasons to turn them on, and the rules about them in both the U.S. and Canada. What are DRLs? A DRL is a daytime running light. These come standard, along with the many other types of light on a roadworthy vehicle. But they serve a distinct purpose. nbsp DRLs are found primarily on the front of a vehicle, but can also be located on the back. They rsquo re intended to make your vehicle more visible on the road, even in daytime conditions. They often turn on automatically, but you may have the option to turn them off. All of the vehicle rsquo s lights are intended to provide visibility and signal to other drivers. This helps prevent accidents by protecting drivers from putting themselves and others at risk. Still, there are more benefits associated with DRLs that we rsquo ll cover in the next section. Benefits of daytime running lights for fleets Daytime running lights DRLs were first mandated in Scandinavian countries in the 1970s. Other northern countries, including Canada, later decided to require running lights during the daytime as well. After all, their drivers could be more likely to encounter snowy or dark conditions during daylight hours. Yet, into the 1990s, they were not even allowed on the road in the United States. Today, though, most North American vehicles are now manufactured with DRLs. While the federal government doesn rsquo t mandate them, DRLs are considered important for fleet vehicles throughout North America for several reasons. nbsp 1. Visibility DRLs increase vehicle visibility on the road during the day. This is especially necessary in daytime situations where there may be low light or poor weather conditions. nbsp Studies have shown daytime running lights also increase the distance at which other drivers on the road can see fleet vehicles. Having functional DRLs also encourages other drivers to conservatively estimate their distances and exhibit safer driving behaviors around vehicles made visible with their lights on. 2. Safety Increasing visibility helps improve overall safety for your drivers and other road users nbsp In one North American study of fleet vehicles, researchers found those with DRLs on during daytime hours had 7 fewer crashes. nbsp In another study , specific to Minnesota between 1995 ndash 2002, researchers found that the crash rate among 184,637 vehicles without standard DRLs was 1.73 times higher than for those with the lights. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA also found DRLs reduced Opposite direction daytime fatal crashes by 5 percent. rdquo nbsp Opposite direction angle daytime non-fatal crashes by 5 percent. rdquo nbsp ldquo Non-motorists, pedestrians and cyclists, daytime fatalities in single-vehicle crashes by 12 percent. rdquo ldquo Daytime opposite direction fatal crashes of a passenger vehicle with a motorcycle by 23 percent. rdquo Equipping your fleet vehicles with DRLs is an added precaution that proves particularly important for commercial trucks or other vehicles that may be larger or have more blind spots. 3. Compliance DRLs are legally required in all new vehicles in many countries, including Canada. Since 1990, all new vehicles made or imported into Canada have needed daytime running lights. If your fleet vehicles are pre-1990 in Canada, you can at least for now get along without DRLs. nbsp In the United States, daytime running lights are not federally mandated. However, ultimately, even without a regulatory compliance and potential fine threat, the benefits of improved visibility and reduced accident risk remain. Are daytime running lights required for fleet vehicles? Short answer? It depends on where you rsquo re driving. This section examines expectations in the United States and Canada. DRL laws and regulations in the U.S. In the United States, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration does not require commercial vehicles to use DRL. Title 49, Subtitle B, nbsp Chapter V, nbsp Part 571, Subpart B, nbsp sect 571.108 defines daytime running lights as ldquo steady burning lamps that are used to improve the conspicuity of a vehicle from the front and front sides when the regular headlamps are not required for driving. rdquo Yet they are listed as ldquo permitted but not required on passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles MPV , trucks, and buses. rdquo States that required daytime running lights nbsp No states require daytime running lights. Still, there are some that have expectations for headlight use during the day Illinois, Maryland and Missouri require daytime headlights if wipers are in use. nbsp Georgia requires them when it is raining or there rsquo s limited visibility. nbsp Arizona specifies headlights for ldquo snow and ice. rdquo nbsp South Dakota requires that you need to have headlights on ldquo when you cannot see at least 200 feet ahead of you. rdquo Tennessee requires the use of headlights ldquo when you cannot see at least 200 feet in front of you rdquo and ldquo when windshield wipers are in continual use. rdquo North Carolina requires headlights when you ldquo cannot see more than 400 feet in front of you rdquo and ldquo whenever windshield wipers are in use. rdquo Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, and New Mexico, Vermont require headlights ldquo when you cannot see at least 500 feet in front of you. rdquo nbsp Rhode Island and South Carolina require headlights ldquo when you cannot see at least 500 feet in front of you rdquo and ldquo when windshield wipers are in continual use. rdquo Arkansas, District of Columbia, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Virginia state that headlights must be on ldquo during periods of fog, rain, snow, or sleet rdquo and ldquo when you cannot see at least 500 feet in front of you. rdquo nbsp Massachusetts adds a requirement for headlights when you are driving in a tunnel. Alaska, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Texas require headlights to be on ldquo when you cannot see at least 1,000 feet ahead of you. rdquo nbsp California rsquo s driver rsquo s handbook further recommends ldquo using headlights on country roads or up in the mountains even on sunny days to make it easy for other drivers to see you. rdquo Delaware, Kansas, Maine, Ohio, and Pennsylvania require that ldquo headlights must be turned on when you cannot see at least 1,000 feet ahead of you rdquo and ldquo when windshield wipers are in continuous or intermittent operation. rdquo New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Utah state that headlights ldquo must be in use when you cannot see at least 1,000 feet ahead of you rdquo and when the weather is foggy, snowy, sleeting, hailing, stormy, dusty or otherwise adverse. Though the exact adverse weather conditions defined vary. DRL laws and regulations in Canada Canadians are expected to have their daytime running lights on whenever their headlights are not on. If it rsquo s not bright out e.g., dawn, dusk, or you rsquo re driving in a tunnel , drivers should use their headlights. Also, when it rsquo s hard to see e.g., raining . Canada, in fact, added further light legislation to combat the problem of people driving with DRLs on and not switching to headlights at night. Starting September 2021, all new vehicles sold in Canada were required to have headlights, taillights, and side lights that automatically turn on in the dark.

            "Transportation and logistics companies are under constant pressure to meet supply chain demands, comply with regulations, and optimize their operations. Yet fleet owners share another common goal getting road drivers home safely at the end of the day. Anti-lock brakes help fleet managers reach that goal by supporting fleet vehicle safety . Learn the basics, benefits, and anti-lock brake best practices in this article. What is ABS and what does ABS stand for? ABS is a common abbreviation of anti-lock brake systems. An anti-lock braking system is a safety feature because it helps drivers remain in control of their vehicles during hard braking. nbsp Anti-lock brake technology was first seen in cars in the 1920s. But it wasn rsquo t until the 1990s that they grew common in trucks and cars. The United States and Canada have required ABS on medium and heavy trucks, tractors, semi-trailers and buses since 2000. Since 2012, ABS has been standard in all new passenger vehicles manufactured in both countries. Keep brakes in top shape with preventive fleet maintenance. Why are anti-lock brakes better? In an emergency, you may have to brake suddenly and forcefully. But this could cause skidding, and drivers can lose control of their vehicles. An ABS restores the grip to tires while maneuvering the wheels. Drivers no longer need to think mdash in the moment mdash of ldquo pumping the brakes rdquo or worry about how to steer the wheels properly ABS technology keeps the wheels from locking during hard braking. This is especially useful on slippery roads or gravel surfaces on which it can be more difficult to control steering when braking with force. nbsp How anti-lock brakes work An ABS consists of a hydraulic unit, electronic control unit, and speed sensors. Wheel-speed sensors transmit information to the control. When the control unit determines pressure is applied to the brakes, it controls the hydraulic unit rsquo s force. If the wheels are at risk of locking, the system releases just enough to keep the wheel moving while still applying brake force . nbsp In fact, ABS can apply differing amounts of force to different wheels, or may release repeatedly in just a second to help avoid skidding, jackknifing, and trailer swing-out. The hydraulic pressure might pump as rapidly as 15 times a second . nbsp In a conventional skid, loss of control of vehicle steering can result in the vehicle continuing to travel in the direction of the skid. With ABS, however, the modulation of the brakes improves your control of the vehicle to better enable you steer out of the skid. nbsp Drivers can let the ABS do what it is designed to do by avoiding pumping the brake pedal in abrupt stops. Instead, drivers apply a solid, steady pressure to the brakes until the vehicle comes to a stop. With ABS, pumping the brakes will only make it take longer for the vehicle to stop. What are the three types of ABS? There are three main kinds of ABS. These types of anti-lock brake system are differentiated by the number of sensors or channels Four-channel four-sensor ABS has the capability to pulse only the affected wheel or wheels Three-channel three-sensor ABS features two front ABS sensors and one in the rear, located in the axle housing, to affect both rear brakes One-channel one-sensor ABS is common in trucks with rear anti-lock brakes. The sensor is only in the rear axle housing. The four-channel ABS is generally considered the best as it monitors and controls each wheel independently. With a three-channel system controlling both rear wheels it is possible one wheel could still lock. Importance of anti-lock brakes in fleet vehicles Fleet vehicles are often on the road heavy with loads. They are also bigger and more unwieldy than passenger cars. This means they require a larger space cushion as it can take longer to come to a full stop, even in good conditions. nbsp ABS technology is particularly important. Anti-braking technology makes it easier to steer safely and remain in control, which is all the more important when the vehicle in question can weigh as much as 80,000 pounds. Under ideal conditions, a car might take five seconds to stop from 60 mph 96.6 kph . But, if a wheel locks, it can stop spinning in under a second. That leads to the car skidding. The effect is magnified in larger, heavier vehicles. With an ABS in control, the tires can slow at the same rate as the vehicle. Fleet vehicles with multiple-drivers ABS is particularly important for fleet vehicles that have multiple drivers as the individual behind the wheel can rsquo t rely on familiarity with that particular vehicle. Unlike when a driver has day-in day-out experience with the same brakes, and gets used to that vehicle rsquo s responsiveness, fleet drivers can benefit from the improved responsiveness offered by ABS. Anti-lock brakes and fleet safety Interest in vehicle safety features and government mandates are driving ABS market growth globally. Today, anti-lock braking system manufacturers offer ABS for vehicles with two wheels, passenger cars, and commercial vehicles. This section covers some of the central benefits of ABS. Reduce risk of accidents and injuries The effect of ABS on crash rates continues to be an area of study. One National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA report noted ldquo under many pavement conditions antilock brake systems allow the driver to stop a vehicle more rapidly while maintaining steering control even during situations of extreme, panic braking. rdquo The same report cited other research Crediting the introduction of ABS with a 24 percent reduction in multi-vehicle crashes involving fatalities, and nonfatal crashes by 14 percent Associating ABS with a 17 percent decrease in rollover crashes, a 13 percent reduction in frontal impacts with parked vehicles or fixed objects, and a reduction in pedestrian crashes on dry roads and in unfavorable conditions of 30 percent and 10 percent respectively nbsp Decrease fleet liability You can rsquo t predict what will happen on the road, but with anti-lock brake systems cutting accident rates and related injuries, you can anticipate a decrease in fleet liability. This not only helps protect your business rsquo bottom line but also avoids potential damage to your company s public image. nbsp Better bottom line Keeping your vehicles well-maintained and safe on the road means fewer disruptions. This can increase your operational efficacy. When your vehicles perform better, your fleet delivers loads on schedule and keeps customers happy, which can lead to more contracts and business growth. nbsp Drivers will enjoy the consistent workload and feeling safe in their vehicles while driving for your fleet. This boosts your retention rates, which in turn, NTSCE research shows, can help lower your collision rates too. Anti-lock brakes best practices for fleets You want your fleet vehicles out on the road. Still, it rsquo s important to take the time to ensure vehicle safety. You don rsquo t want your drivers to be out on the road when they realize there is a problem with the ABS on their vehicle. These best practices can help make fleet vehicle safety easier. nbsp Check vehicle before driving As part of your vehicle inspection routine , you rsquo ll want to confirm before going on the road that the ABS is functioning properly. That starts with knowing where to find the ABS lamps. Typically, you can find a yellow colored lamp, marked ldquo ABS, rdquo on the truck or bus instrument panel. ABS controls are designed to warn the driver of any malfunction. Issues may arise when sensors are affected by debris or metal shavings or the unit wiring is damaged. Brake system neglect or contaminated brake fluid can also cause ABS problems. Coach driver behavior Comprehensive driver training is a key safety improvement strategy . Anti-lock brakes are a helpful tool, but they will have a greater success rate when you coach your drivers to avoid risky behaviors. This includes Speeding Aggressive driving Following at unsafe distances Distracted driving Creating a culture of safety overall and communicating the importance of safety , even beyond ABS, on an ongoing basis will prove valuable. Learn from Motive experts about the importance of monitoring driver behaviors and identifying coaching opportunities using dash cams and fleet management software technology. Be proactive Don rsquo t just wait for ABS warning lights to notify you that there rsquo s an issue. Instead, include your braking mechanisms in your preventative maintenance planning. Although there is no predetermined amount of time or mileage dictating how often to schedule ABS maintenance , you can use telematics data accompanied by manufacturer rsquo s recommendations to plan ahead and avoid unscheduled maintenance. Taking a proactive approach to maintenance with periodic and routine upkeep of vehicles can help keep your assets in optimal condition. Reduce risk of accidents that could have been prevented with fully functioning anti-lock brakes. Preventative fleet maintenance will also maximize availability and prevent sudden, expensive malfunctions and subsequent downtimes. nbsp Prioritize maintenance for safer fleet vehicles Keep fleet vehicles in the best shape possible by consolidating all your vehicle data, inspection information, and maintenance and repair history in one convenient dashboard view. Using a preventative maintenance schedule software can make scheduling maintenance work easier so your daily operations aren rsquo t disrupted. Configure Motive rsquo s truck maintenance software to automatically remind you of upcoming scheduled tune-ups and upkeep activities to remain on top of repairs and ensure all fleet vehicles receive appropriate care.

            "For decades, California has been associated with smog so thick it can obscure skyscrapers or the Golden Gate Bridge. In 2022, California counties took the top six spots on a listing of America rsquo s ldquo Most Polluted Places to Live . rdquo California rsquo s smog check rules are just one of the ways the state is working to combat air pollution. nbsp What is a smog test? A smog test is an inspection of vehicle emissions required for registering vehicles and renewing vehicle registrations. The test needs to be performed at a licensed facility. Results will be reported to your state rsquo s department of motor vehicles. nbsp Smog tests are not specific to California. More than 30 states in the United States require emissions testing. Fleet vehicles that are traveling nationally will want to check the Environmental Protection Agency EPA rules for testing in different states. Still, the focus of this article is California. With 15 of its counties making the American Lung Association rsquo s Top 25 ldquo Most Polluted Places to Live , rdquo the Golden State requires smog checks to help improve air quality. According to the state rsquo s Bureau of Automotive Repair BAR , ldquo approximately 400 tons of these smog-forming emissions are removed from California rsquo s air each day rdquo due to the smog check program. What happens during a smog check? A California smog check is designed to make sure vehicles are not emitting types of pollutants that are banned or more pollutants than allowed under EPA standards. There are several components to a smog check, though not all vehicles are subject to all parts of the test. Visual inspection In the visual inspection, the smog inspector will confirm that all the emissions equipment is properly connected. They rsquo ll also do a visual smoke check for excessive black smoke if you rsquo re driving a diesel vehicle under 14,500 GVW. Functional inspection This part of the process checks the vehicle rsquo s ignition timing, exhaust gas recirculation system, fuel evaporative system, and gas cap. On-Board Diagnostic OBD system inspection The inspector will verify data from your internal emissions diagnostics system and ensure that your Malfunction Indicator Light MIL , what we think of as the ldquo check engine rdquo light, is working properly. Any errors on your OBD could make your vehicle fail. Tailpipe emissions inspection In this part of the test, the level of pollutants emitted is measured. The volume and type of pollutants e.g., hydrocarbons, carbon monoxides, and nitrides of oxygen oxides are tested against EPA standards. nbsp Which vehicles are required to have a California smog certificate? The regulation mainly covers all cars and light-duty trucks. California requires gasoline-powered vehicles, model-year 1976 and newer, to have a smog certificate. Still, there are some exceptions. Starting January 1, 2019, California allowed drivers to pay a smog abatement fee on vehicles less than four model years old, nbsp instead of getting a smog inspection for the first 8 years that your vehicle is registered. Vehicle owners receive a certification of compliance after the vehicle passes the smog check tests. At the completion of the tests they get both a Vehicle Inspection Report VIR and the smog certificate. How much does a smog check cost? Smog check price varies depending on type of vehicle tested, type of smog check required, and location. California rsquo s BAR doesn rsquo t regulate smog test prices. Yet, the typical smog check cost is between 30 and 60. The BAR recommends calling around to compare smog test costs at local stations near you. Of course, if the vehicle needs repairs to pass the smog test, that will cost you more. Which vehicles in California are smog-check exempt? A fleet vehicle would be exempt if The vehicle is gas-powered and less than eight model-years old It is a 1997 or older model year diesel-powered vehicle The vehicle is diesel- or natural gas-powered and has a gross vehicle weight of more than 14,000 pounds The vehicle is electric That said, heavy duty fleet vehicles are now also subject to emissions checks. Just not in the same way as cars and light duty vehicles. nbsp In 2019, California moved to bolster its emissions checks with a Heavy-Duty Vehicle Inspections and Maintenance Program . The program, taking effect this year, uses onboard diagnostics OBD system data to measure emissions control in heavy-duty trucks and buses. Vehicles registered both in- and out-of-state are subject to the twice-a-year inspections, no matter the fleet size . Owner-vehicle reporting begins mid-2023. Periodic compliance testing is due to begin in 2024. There is also an accompanying 30 annual fee , even for out-of-state heavy duty fleet vehicles. How often is a smog check required in California? Expect to do a smog check every two years as part of your car or light-duty vehicle registration process. The registration renewal notice you get from the state rsquo s Department of Motor Vehicles DMV will tell you if a smog check is required. nbsp If the fleet vehicle is changing hands, or you rsquo re registering it for the first time in California, you rsquo ll also need to get a smog check. What happens if a fleet vehicle fails a California smog check? If a vehicle fails its smog check , you need to take it to a licensed Test-and-Repair station or a Repair-Only station. The results of your smog check will be recorded within one business day. So, you can schedule a follow-up appointment as early as the next day after your failed test. To schedule a vehicle smog check results review, you will need to provide License plate number and or vehicle identification number VIN Reason s you are seeking a Smog Check Referee inspection Vehicle Inspection Report from your most recent smog check Once you complete the vehicle repairs, you rsquo ll retest. That station will electronically send your smog certification to the DMV when the vehicle passes. Why do vehicles fail smog inspections? There are a number of common reasons your vehicle can fail its smog check. These include Excessive tailpipe emissions Modifications done with non-approved parts or computer programing Failures of the check engine light or OBD monitor nbsp Faulty sensors or computer controls Bureau of Automotive Repair BAR referees can help locate hard-to-find emissions parts and assist with unusual inspections. To learn more, visit www.bar.ca.gov. Where to get smog tests in California Smog tests need to be done at an authorized station . The majority of cars and light-duty vehicles are tested at STAR stations, which are monitored by the BAR. There are also Test-Only stations. These specialize in smog inspections, but cannot do diagnostics or repair. If your vehicle fails to pass at a Test-Only station, you will then need to go to a Test-and-Repair station or a Repair-Only station. You can nbsp find a DMV-authorized smog check station nbsp near you or visit nbsp smogcheck.ca.gov . nbsp nbsp How to prepare for a California smog check Taking good care of your vehicle maintenance can help improve your chances of passing a smog check and complying with Heavy Duty inspections . The vehicle rsquo s owner rsquo s manual will help you know what to address and when, but here are some of the regular maintenance actions that can make a difference. Change the oil Low levels of oil or contaminated oil can cause smog check failures. If you rsquo re near due for an oil change before your smog check, go ahead and make the change beforehand. Check the engine If the check engine light comes on, don rsquo t disregard it. The light should be off when you go for a smog check. If it rsquo s on during the smog check, that rsquo s an automatic fail. Ensure your OBD is functioning properly With the new rule requiring biannual reporting of OBD data from heavy-duty commercial vehicles, your fleet can rsquo t risk sensor failures. Making sure your vehicle is fully tuned up can help avoid any issues that will give the inspector reason to fail you. Pay attention to onboard lights Any blinking or flashing light in your vehicle signals there is a problem. To avoid serious damage to your fleet vehicle, and risk smog check failure, get that warning light checked. Fleet Owner cited a California report finding in field tests, nbsp ldquo 11 to 17 of heavy-duty trucks nbsp with onboard diagnostics showed malfunctioning indicator lights, meaning their emissions controls might be faulty. rdquo You rsquo ll also want to avoid tampering with any of the vehicle rsquo s emissions-control equipment. That rsquo s a common reason vehicles fail. One handy way to stay on top of the maintenance requirements for all your fleet vehicles? Take advantage of telematics data integrations to support a preventive maintenance approach . With nbsp automated maintenance reminders and reports on each individual vehicle, specific to its vehicle health data, you can ensure your fleet vehicles are always ready for their smog check. Preventive maintenance ndash it rsquo s about more than smog checks This article has focused on California smog checks. They have helped the state improve its air quality, and that rsquo s a great thing. Still, keeping your fleet well-maintained is not just about compliance. A fleet maintenance solution helps with preventive maintenance but can also help you maximize productivity and optimize costs. nbsp Integrating telematics and vehicle health reporting can make it easier to maintain and access records. This can simplify inspection and compliance reporting, which can be a real time-saver for fleet and safety managers as well as drivers. nbsp Leveraging diagnostic and maintenance data your fleet can also move from reactive maintenance to predictive maintenance . Reduce expenses and avoid fleet downtime by anticipating maintenance and catching defects before they become larger and more expensive issues.

            "Maintaining safe following distances plays a significant role in fleet driver safety, allowing all drivers to make good, well-planned decisions, reduce the risk of collisions, and improve overall safety on the road. All of this benefits your drivers and your fleet rsquo s bottom line. This article shares best practices for commercial vehicles. Learn about the Motive AI Omnicam for 360-degree visibility. What is following distance? Following distance is the distance between a vehicle and the vehicle in front of it. When one vehicle follows another too closely , it doesn rsquo t matter how attentive the drivers are, there could still be a collision if the driver in front brakes suddenly. nbsp It s a component of a vehicle rsquo s space cushion . The space cushion is not only how far ahead another vehicle is, but also how far back other drivers are. The goal is to have empty space around your vehicle at all times. nbsp Keeping a safe following distance as part of the space cushion can help drivers to react in time to unsafe driving or other potential issues on the road. To be safe, you rsquo ll need to know your stopping distance. Calculating stopping distance Safe following distance takes into account stopping distance, which consists of reaction distance and braking distance. nbsp When a driver perceives a danger or need to stop, the time it takes to move the foot from the accelerator to brake is the driver rsquo s reaction distance. Once the brakes are deployed, the vehicle will still travel some distance before coming to a complete stop. Road and weather conditions, vehicle speed and weight, and tire tread are among factors that can play a role in this distance mdash the braking distance. nbsp Thus, stopping distance combines reaction and braking distance. Put another way, stopping distance reaction distance braking distance. Now, we rsquo ll explore how your following distance is determined and what the recommended minimum is for commercial vehicles. Recommended minimum following distance for commercial vehicles The recommended minimum following distance for a passenger vehicle will be different from the safe following distance for heavy-duty trucks. Yet the size and weight of your vehicle aren rsquo t the only considerations when calculating how far back to stay from others on the road. Factors that affect following distance Leaving enough distance allows drivers time to see what rsquo s happening on the road ahead, process that information, and react. Your total following distance is determined by several factors including Vehicle size and weight. The larger and heavier your vehicle, the longer it takes for that vehicle to come to a complete stop. In ideal conditions, a typical passenger vehicle traveling 65 miles per hour takes 316 feet to stop. That rsquo s about the length of a football field. A loaded tractor-trailer traveling that same speed, though, needs an average of 525 feet to stop almost the length of two football fields . Speed. The faster your vehicle is traveling the more distance you need for safe following. Road conditions. Different road surfaces impact the following distance, as will debris on the road such as oil . nbsp Weather conditions. Rain, ice, smog, and snow can all impact the distance needed for a vehicle to come to a complete stop. Traffic patterns. Not every road is a clear, level straightaway. Turns, inclines, and declines factor into following distance. The amount of traffic on the road also makes a difference as drivers have less room to maneuver in heavy traffic. Work zones are another place to increase your following distance for added safety. Driver traits. Every driver has a different reaction time depending on their age, vision, or skill. nbsp Calculate the correct following distance for CMVs You always need to be attentive on the road, but keeping sufficient distance helps improve your safety. One common approach to determine a safe following distance for trucks or other vehicles is to apply the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicle rsquo s rule of seconds , which is ldquo If you are driving below 40 mph, you should leave at least one second for every 10 feet of vehicle length. For a typical tractor-trailer, this results in four seconds between you and the leading vehicle. For speeds over 40 mph, you should leave one additional second. rdquo It probably takes longer to stop than you think. After all, your total stopping distance has three component parts nbsp The distance traveled while you anticipate, decide, and act on a perceived hazard The distance traveled during your reaction to the hazard The distance traveled when you press the brake until the vehicle stops nbsp How to maintain proper following distance You can also maintain a safe following distance for semi-trucks or other commercial motor vehicles by adjusting your distance based on the conditions around you. In adverse conditions, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA recommends doubling your follow distance. nbsp Drivers may also need to adjust the distance from the lead vehicle to account for weather conditions, visibility, and traffic. In emergency conditions, maintaining a safe distance can allow you to stop safely and or take necessary evasive action. Best practices for maintaining following distance Commercial vehicle fleets can work to ensure drivers are keeping safe following distances. The following strategies can help. Know safe following distance Some commercial vehicle drivers also need to understand brake lag. Passenger vehicles typically have hydraulic brakes, which are faster. Yet, semi-trucks have air brakes. There rsquo s a delay when semi-truck drivers hit the brakes, as air has to build up and reach everywhere on the truck to stop the wheels. Think of it like a garden hose when you turn the nozzle the water has to travel through the hose before coming out the other end. The difference in safe following distance for trucks may also be reflected in state law variations. If you rsquo re driving across borders, it rsquo s a good idea to confirm if there is a legal following distance requirement for trucks. Use safety technologies Technology is changing the trucking industry and playing an important part in improving road safety. nbsp The vehicle rsquo s anti-lock braking system ABS can help the driver maintain control in an emergency situation. nbsp An automatic emergency braking AEB system is an onboard technology that identifies possible collisions and activates the brakes to avoid a potential accident. This safety tool uses cameras, radar, and light detection and ranging LiDAR to act as an additional set of eyes on the road. With dash cams and fleet safety management software , you rsquo re able to alert your drivers in real time if they rsquo re following too closely. AI-powered dash cam technology can notify drivers of the risk on the road. Managers can set it up so that they receive notifications as well. With Motive, you can follow up after the route is complete with automatic coaching in the Driver App . Coach drivers nbsp Train drivers on the importance of maintaining safe following distances and the consequences of not doing so. For example, this video of a CMV driver following too closely shows a near collision when the driver ahead slows to change lanes. It could be useful in a driver training session on following distance. You can also educate drivers about best practices such as always scanning the road ahead, anticipating potential hazards, maintaining safe speeds, and avoiding distracted driving . nbsp Using dash cams and fleet management software, safety managers can identify unsafe driving habits and offer individualized training. nbsp Consequences of tailgating or following too closely In addition to educating drivers about the meaning of following distance, it will help also to make sure they understand the possible consequences. Following too closely is a common moving violation for drivers of commercial vehicles. Tailgating or following too closely can also result in Increased likelihood of collisions, which can result in property damage, injuries, and fatalities. Increased severity of collisions, as the force of impact is greater when vehicles are traveling at high speeds and following too closely. Legal repercussions. In addition to a ticket for driving too closely, drivers could also face charges for reckless or aggressive driving. Those charges can lead to a fine, jail sentence, and permanent criminal record. Increased insurance rates. Collisions and or charges are going to prompt insurance companies to raise your premiums. Beyond safety, the benefits of better driving habits Following best practices helps drivers and improves overall road safety. But that rsquo s not all. It can also have a positive impact on other factors that affect your fleet rsquo s bottom line. nbsp Driver retention Driver recruitment and retention are real issues for commercial fleets. Yet, with increased driver safety, a fleet is more likely to retain its drivers. By taking a consistent coaching approach and offering dash cams, you can show your drivers that you care about their road safety. That improved driver retention can also help with fleet safety by keeping your more experienced drivers on the road. So, it rsquo s a win-win. Improve productivity Preventing accidents eliminates associated injuries and vehicle downtime. Driver job satisfaction also improves, which can motivate drivers to do their best work. With fleet vehicles in top condition , your workers can arrive on site, on time, and ready to go. Lower costs Better driving can lower fleet insurance rates and avoid costly fines or legal fees. A better safety record can also help fleets win more business, which can help optimize route efficiency to lower costs. nbsp At the same time, you don rsquo t have to deal with downtime for crash investigations or the costs of collision repairs. Increase fleet safety with the Safety Hub and driver coaching Knowing how following distance is determined and the value of safe distances for all vehicles can protect your drivers, your business, and others on the road. Don rsquo t underestimate the power of coaching coupled with safety technology to encourage continuous learning and improve your productivity and profitability. nbsp nbsp Motive rsquo s Safety Hub is designed to help fleets identify risks and prevent accidents.

            "The costs of commercial vehicle crashes are higher than ever. In addition to the cost of human life, crashes cost an average of 148,279 with an injury or 7.2 million with a fatality . Long after an incident, fleets face higher insurance premiums, damaged reputations, and trouble hiring and retaining fleet drivers. nbsp That rsquo s why smart fleets are getting proactive about safety. And one of the best ways to go about it? By developing coaching programs to improve fleet driver behaviors . After all, even the most experienced drivers can pick up unsafe habits over time. They don rsquo t always notice that they rsquo ve gradually decreased their following distance or developed a lead foot. nbsp That rsquo s where blending AI-powered dash cam video with a strong coaching program can help. Video can show drivers their behavior, while coaching provides opportunities to instill better habits and connect the behavior with what rsquo s at stake. For example, coaching provides an opportunity to share with drivers learnings like Driving after being awake for more than 20 hours is the equivalent of driving with a 0.08 blood-alcohol concentration . nbsp Fleet drivers with a speeding violation are 47 more likely to have a future crash . Recognition errors including inattention, distractions, and inadequate surveillance cause 41 of all accidents . Combining technology with a coaching program pays off. A Motive study found that fleets using its AI-powered dash cams plus frequent coaching saw, on average, 22 fewer accidents and 56 fewer unsafe driving incidents than fleets that did not use dash cams and didn rsquo t coach. As a result, fleets that invested in safety programs saw up to a 10x return on investment in their first year. Let rsquo s look at how blending in-person, remote, and automated coaching can improve fleet driver behavior and overall fleet safety . nbsp Prevent accidents and exonerate drivers with the Motive AI Dashcam. How to conduct in-person safety coaching No matter how good remote technologies get, in-person coaching will long have a role in strong safety programs. When you rsquo re face-to-face with a driver, you can make eye contact and pick up on body language. These interpersonal cues can help you gauge if the message is getting through and how it rsquo s being received. Strive for clear, consistent communication that resonates . In-person coaching is especially helpful in building relationships and trust with new team members. This takes time, but it rsquo s well worth the effort. Strong relationships can improve fleet driver retention. nbsp When a new person joins your team, aim to have a couple of in-person coaching sessions as part of their onboarding and orientation. Use this time to get to know them while sharing company policies and expectations. In-person coaching is also practical when a driver rsquo s role changes to include new routes or equipment. Periodic check-ins for continuous training and refreshers are vital. So is corrective action for specific behaviors or skills. nbsp If possible, try to schedule a regular in-person coaching session with each team member. Depending on your team rsquo s size and geography, and each driver rsquo s level of safety, this may be just once a year. If you rsquo re able to, aim to get together at least quarterly, or more often for newer drivers. How to conduct remote safety coaching Sometimes an incident demands more immediate attention. If a driver has a near-miss, you want to discuss it within a couple of days, not wait three months for your next in-person session. This is where remote coaching can be so valuable, especially for far-flung teams. nbsp Remote coaching can occur via phone or video chat , whether it rsquo s FaceTime, Zoom, or another platform. It rsquo s a great way to connect with fleet drivers one-on-one without needing to be in the same place. Remote coaching can reinforce things you rsquo ve discussed during in-person sessions or provide a convenient way to address new incidents or questions. nbsp Don rsquo t try to jump into remote coaching too quickly after an incident if emotions are still running high. Take some time to make sure you rsquo re putting things into the proper perspective. When does a fleet driver need remote coaching? How do you know when a driver needs remote coaching? You can schedule periodic check-ins, or use Motive rsquo s AI coaching workflow to identify incidents that merit a conversation. nbsp Rather than requiring you to review hundreds of hours of dash cam footage, Motive rsquo s AI automates the process, adding context and scoring each incident for severity. The coaching workflow in the Motive Fleet Dashboard helps focus your efforts on the most important incidents. For example, if Motive notifies you of a driver rsquo s near-miss, watch the video. Then watch it again. What do you see? Was your driver in the wrong, or did they take proper defensive action? nbsp If your fleet driver was in the wrong, you rsquo ll need to address it, but do so calmly . Make sure you rsquo re prepared to explain how the driver erred and offer proactive steps for improvement. Before the session, send the video to the driver and ask that they review it before you meet. The driver can see the footage right in the Motive Driver App. When you meet, make sure you rsquo re both in a quiet place where you can talk uninterrupted. Watch the video together, then discuss it. Ask what the driver thinks and if there rsquo s anything they wish they would have done differently. nbsp But don rsquo t limit remote coaching to correcting driver mistakes. If your driver narrowly avoided an accident thanks to their quick thinking and defensive driving, coaching the situation is just as valuable. Even a quick text with a ldquo nice job rdquo can reinforce their behavior. Share these types of positive incidents with the entire team. nbsp How to use automated safety coaching Automated coaching is ideal for keeping fleet drivers engaged with your safety program day-in and day-out. Over time, automated coaching helps drivers continue their development with more privacy and autonomy. nbsp Some of the best drivers earn their reputations because they proactively monitor their actions and seek continuous improvement. With automated coaching, in-cab alerts can notify drivers of unsafe behaviors in the moment, allowing them to correct unsafe behavior in real time. Video clips shared with drivers through the Motive Driver App let drivers review their own footage before discussing it with a coach. And the Motive Driver App can send automated coaching tips directly to drivers, helping them continue to improve without involving their manager. An approach like this saves time for everyone. Automated coaching keeps coaching top-of-mind for fleet drivers, reminding them of safe habits you may have previously discussed with them while giving them opportunities to improve. In a large, dispersed fleet where you may only be able to meet a couple of times a year, automated coaching helps fill the gaps and facilitate steady growth. How Motive can help your coaching program thrive When you blend AI Dashcams with a dedicated coaching program, your team can enjoy fewer accidents, safer fleet drivers, and lower costs.

There rsquo s an abundance of ideas about how to develop a culture that supports safety. Frequent suggestions include Setting and communicating goals Recognizing and rewarding positive behaviors nbsp Getting your drivers involved Evaluating the program on an ongoing basis Soliciting driver feedback into the safety program While these steps can help support workplace and driver safety, they don rsquo t sufficiently highlight the importance of an engaged culture. According to Gallup research , prioritizing employee engagement helps decrease absenteeism 81 and employee turnover 18 for high turnover organizations . It can also result in 64 fewer safety incidents. nbsp Cutting your safety incidents by 64 can benefit your business in many ways. Decreasing accidents can reduce insurance costs and increase Compliance, Safety and Accountability CSA scores . High insurance premiums cut into your bottom line. Low CSA scores can lose you business as shippers and 3PLs often look at CSA score data when choosing carriers. These examples alone demonstrate the value of fleet safety. But, how does driver engagement correlate with safety? We rsquo ll discuss that in more detail next. Visit Motive s fleet safety education hub. Engaging leadership and your fleet safety program Overall workplace culture plays a major role in reaching your business goals. Engaging leaders are key to establishing the culture you want. Research shows over and again that disengaged employees are less likely to work hard, feel motivated, or meet business expectations. These behaviors decrease productivity and profitability, but also undermine your safety initiatives . Yet engaging leaders are more likely to earn employee trust and commitment . With engaging leaders at the helm nbsp People listen when the importance of safety is communicated Employees are more likely to accept responsibility and admit mistakes Collaboration on decisions to improve safety nbsp Employees take action to sustain a successful safety program There rsquo s more feedback and recognition to ensure consistency nbsp All of these work together to create a positive culture where your drivers voluntarily do what they can to live up to safety expectations. nbsp A professor at Harvard rsquo s T.H. Chan School of Public Health puts it this way ldquo Imagine a stick figure without a head. That is a model of transactional leadership mdash focused on work, tasks, and output. rdquo That rsquo s not engaging leadership. Then, the former Director of Health and Safety Worldwide at Procter and Gamble, says, ldquo Now add a smiley face and a heart to that stick figure. That rsquo s how a transformational leader sees the workforce mdash as a whole person, with a head and a heart. By engaging the whole worker in the work process, whatever that process is, you end up with a better product. rdquo Engaging leadership is about establishing mutual self interest. An engaging leader demonstrates, through communication, collaboration, and listening , that they care about more than output. Linking the worker rsquo s needs to the objectives of safety policies and programs, they can encourage excellence. nbsp Scalable safety program implementation best practices nbsp There are many reasons to take action to improve your fleet safety program. Increasing accident rates and liability in addition to rising insurance costs are a financial burden. Damaging your fleet rsquo s reputation in the face of a driver and operator shortage isn rsquo t going to help your recruitment. Plus, there rsquo s simply the ethical importance of embracing safety and protecting people out on the road along with your employees and assets. nbsp These four best practices can help your leaders scale a successful safety program. nbsp 1.

            "Electronic logging devices ELDs first hit the road in the mid-1980s . Still, it was another 30 years before they became mandatory for truck drivers. Today, they have replaced paper logging for commercial vehicle fleets. This article explores in more detail how an ELD can help improve fleet safety . Learn more about the features that make such a difference in keeping people safer on the road while also simplifying compliance and business processes. What is an ELD? An ELD is an electronic logging device built to track a driver rsquo s hours of service HOS . ELD refers to a hardware device that you connect to the vehicle engine rsquo s electronic control module ECM . nbsp An ELD monitors drive time and fleet compliance , and stores the driver rsquo s record of duty status RODS along with other important data. nbsp The ELD will automatically log all driving time in at least 60-minute intervals and record data from the ECM to automatically document vehicle motion status, engine power status, and other related information. In the United States, all ELDs must be registered with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA , and self-certified to be compliant with the Federal nbsp ELD mandate . In Canada, the ELD must be tested and certified by a third-party certification body accredited by the Minister of Transport . nbsp Automate ELD compliance with Motive. Learn how. Top functions of an ELD The ELD is designed to provide accurate and automatic recordkeeping of a wide range of data including trip date and time, vehicle geo-location, engine hours, miles driven, and the identification of the driver, vehicle, and motor carrier. The ELD tracks location within a one-mile radius when the driver is on duty, but gives a 10-mile radius for more privacy during permitted personal use. Accurate information is kept for the current 24-hour period and the prior seven consecutive days. Data is easily transferred e.g., through telematics, Bluetooth, or USB to the business system. Then, drivers or back office managers can access electronic or print copies of the tamper-proof data received. Why the ELD was introduced ELDs were introduced to keep people safer on the road in response to a rising accident rate and National Transportation Safety Board and the American Trucking Associations concerns. The FMCSA estimated, in passing the final ELD rule in 2015 , that ELD technology could lead to ldquo 1,844 crashes avoided annually and 26 lives saved annually. rdquo The ELD rule was also intended, per the Department of Transportation , ldquo to help create a safer work environment for drivers, and make it easier and faster to accurately track, manage, and share records of duty status RODS data. rdquo Trucking companies must now place an electronic logging device or ELD system inside all commercial trucks that operate more than 100 miles from their company rsquo s home base. What an ELD does for fleet safety ELDs help drivers ensure they do not exceed the maximum number of hours they are allowed to drive in a day or week. But compliance with HOS regulations isn rsquo t the only fleet safety benefit gained from installing an ELD. Reduce accidents The data gained from ELDs can support improved driver safety on the road and cut accident risk . The ELD can monitor hard braking, hard acceleration, and hard cornering events. This information can be used to focus training in the right areas and encourage safer fleet behavior overall. nbsp Meanwhile, you rsquo re saving your drivers time by automating reporting and electronically recording necessary information. This can help you lower the stress associated with the job, giving drivers less urgency on the road. That in turn can help you retain your best qualified drivers, which can lower accident risk as well. Prevent vehicle breakdowns A connected ELD makes it easy to spot vehicle and asset defects detailed in drivers rsquo inspection reports. You can customize the driver vehicle inspection report DVIR to suit your needs while benefiting from full visibility into maintenance needs. Being able to repair damage quickly not only avoids expensive downtime but also ensures your vehicles on the road are in top condition. Connects driver and back office With electronic logging, fleet managers can know when HOS limits are approaching without the driver having to check-in by phone with dispatch. Drivers get alerts on the road that they rsquo re close to their limit. They can also get help identifying the closest stop to take their rest, which helps counter driver fatigue . At the same time, managers can get email notifications of HOS violations or disconnected equipment. Your business might also set geofence boundaries to alert them of yard moves or unauthorized assets in transit to prevent asset theft. Or set boundaries for areas that are riskier for drivers, so your safety managers can know when the truck has entered or leaves that zone. Read Best practices of successful fleet managers . How to make the most of your ELD An ELD is not only beneficial for fleet safety. Today rsquo s ELDs integrate with fleet safety software to provide you with many other features to leverage in bettering your business operations. nbsp Improve compliance Having an ELD on each of your fleet vehicles improves compliance with HOS regulations. Electronic logging makes data management simpler and can help safety managers resolve violations faster. With ELD data supporting notifications of any critical issues and proactive CSA monitoring as well, your business can enjoy greater visibility into overall fleet compliance health. nbsp Trade Star rsquo s Senior Operations Manager Kari Gib found keeping accurate records a struggle when working with drivers rsquo paper logs. ldquo It rsquo s horrendously difficult to maintain a DOT compliant record when your drivers are on paper logs. Period, rdquo he said. Yet when the oil and gas transportation expert switched to an electronic solution, fleet visibility improved and the company enjoyed spotless roadside inspections too. Cut costs An ELD can help your fleet reduce FMCSA fines and forecast CSA scores to earn lower insurance premium rates. With automated CSA monitoring, managers can prioritize risk factors to focus on, and when. nbsp Managing HOS, DVIR, and IFTA in one solution also helps your fleet work smarter and avert audits, That saves time and money. Additionally, reducing accidents cuts your risk of insurance costs jumping or a nuclear court verdict. ELD systems track driver idle time as well. This can be used to identify drivers or loading docks that consistently have more idle time. Then, cut fuel costs by incentivizing drivers to cut idle time or rerouting deliveries to avoid excess detention times. Streamline driver dispatch A compliant ELD tracks vehicle location with an accuracy of a one-mile radius during on-duty driving times. Having near real-time access to this kind of data about the driver rsquo s route makes it easier for managers to optimize routes, assign next destinations, and match drivers with loads. Plus, with the automatic visibility into each individual rsquo s driving time-clocks, plans can be made that won rsquo t risk HOS violations. nbsp View the product brief for Motive Dispatch .

            "Every day, last-mile delivery vehicles roam residential neighborhoods and city centers, full of packages, groceries, appliances, furniture, and more. In 2022, 35.6 million packages were shipped on an average day , meaning the average American received 21 packages throughout the year. nbsp This continues a trend that has only grown since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The last-mile delivery market is forecast to grow another 62 between 2023 and 2027 . nbsp Yet ldquo free shipping rdquo is far from free studies show that up to 53 of total transportation costs are consumed by the last stretch to a customer rsquo s home . And while Amazon Logistics hired 275,000 workers in 2020 to keep up with the demand, fleets are struggling to hire enough drivers to meet the demand. They often turn to part-time contractors using their own vehicles or third-party companies. nbsp No matter who they work for, last-mile delivery drivers must meet aggressive time and productivity goals. Drivers may make more than 200 stops in a single day , creating more opportunities for accidents. nbsp That rsquo s why many last-mile delivery fleets are focusing on improving driver safety mdash which can also improve productivity and consumer satisfaction. In this post, we rsquo ll explore nbsp How AI can identify the most dangerous driver behaviors to minimize accidents nbsp How fleets can use dash cam footage to exonerate drivers Why a focus on safety can keep drivers on schedule How real-time updates and geofencing can improve tracking and customer satisfaction How AI can identify the most dangerous driver behaviors Last-mile delivery drivers are under pressure to deliver quickly mdash which may prompt them to take risks behind the wheel. They may also look at a smartphone to view their next stop while the vehicle is in motion. AI can help identify these risky behaviors. For example, Motive rsquo s AI Dashcam can detect unsafe behaviors and alert drivers to modify their behaviors in real time. Motive rsquo s in-cab alerts can instantly notify drivers to keep their eyes on the road, increase their following distance , or take other actions. Correcting behaviors in the moment helps drivers learn from their mistakes. At the fleet level, the Motive Fleet Dashboard adds context to each video, helping fleet managers focus on the most serious incidents without manually reviewing hours of video footage. nbsp With that prioritized footage, fleet managers can coach their drivers to make improvements. It can be very powerful to show drivers how dangerous the situation could have become. nbsp How AI can exonerate last-mile delivery drivers nbsp Dash cam footage can also exonerate drivers when they rsquo re falsely accused of causing an accident. For example, D amp A McRae, Inc shared Motive AI dashcam footage with law enforcement to prove that a collision occurred when their driver was cut off by another vehicle changing lanes. nbsp ldquo Footage from Motive rsquo s Smart Dashcam exonerated our driver on the spot and saved us what could have been close to 50K in damages, rdquo terminal manager Rod Conrad says. The footage also prevented legal headaches and a hit to the driver rsquo s CSA score. How a focus on safety can keep last-mile delivery drivers on schedule Minor fender-benders can cause downtime. Even when no one is injured, drivers must file incident reports, police reports, or other paperwork. Insurance companies get involved. Meanwhile, the driver is still on the clock, with a truck or van full of deliveries growing later and later. nbsp Focusing on reducing your drivers rsquo risky behaviors can reduce your fleet rsquo s overall incident rate mdash keeping drivers on schedule and customers satisfied. Real-time updates and geofencing can improve last-mile delivery tracking and customer satisfaction While many last-mile delivery services simply leave a package on a doorstep, others are more time sensitive. Some require a customer to be home to accept delivery of furniture, electronics, alcohol, or anything that requires installation. Customers can grow frustrated with long delivery windows, especially if the driver is running late. With real-time location tracking, Motive Fleet View can help provide customers with an updated, accurate ETA that keeps customers in the loop. Last-mile delivery tracking that uses geofencing can identify when a driver leaves the previous stop or reaches a certain distance from the customer, enabling an automated message to the customer. Customers are happier when they know that their driver is on the way and will arrive at approximately 11 15 AM rather than ldquo between 8 AM and 12 PM. rdquo nbsp Dispatchers can also use Motive Fleet View to share documents and message drivers so they rsquo re ready with all pertinent details and customer requests. nbsp Better tracking cuts down on frustrated customer calls, wondering where their driver is. nbsp Read The ultimate guide to middle-mile logistics .

            "The oil and gas industry has been aggressively pursuing sustainability goals. A 2021 survey by SAP and Oxford Economics found that 79 of energy and utility executives say sustainability is a major concern at all stages of the manufacturing process, while 47 have committed to a goal of net-zero carbon. nbsp Sustainability can take many forms. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development prompts oil and gas operators to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and freshwater usage. Other goals target a reduction in fossil fuel use or transitioning to renewable energy sources. However, regulatory compliance costs have tripled for the oil and gas industry since the late 1990s. Many oil and gas fleets now spend 5 to 10 of their annual revenue on compliance . That means they must figure out how to balance compliance costs with productivity gains. nbsp Artificial intelligence AI can help oil and gas fleets achieve all of these goals. AI can improve operations at all levels, from fuel consumption and maintenance, through simplified compliance. That means more sustainable fleets are also safer and more productive. See how AI can help oil and gas fleets Reduce fuel consumption Improve driver and fleet safety Boost fleetwide productivity and customer satisfaction How AI helps oil and gas fleets reduce fuel consumption AI can help oil and gas fleets reduce fuel consumption by reducing idling time, improving driver behaviors, and optimizing route efficiency. nbsp The average heavy-duty truck idles about 1,800 hours each year and burns 0.8 gallons of fuel per hour of idling. This adds up quickly, especially across an entire fleet. nbsp AI can aggregate telematics data that tracks each driver rsquo s idling habits, then calculate how much fuel is wasted. Motive Fuel Hub presents a consolidated view of fuel trends across your entire fleet. nbsp With this knowledge, fleet managers can identify which drivers need coaching to reduce idling time. Some fleets even offer incentives for drivers who idle the least or show the greatest improvement. nbsp Similarly, AI can help identify other fuel-wasting behaviors so you can proactively coach your drivers. For example, the U.S. Department of Energy finds that more efficient driving less speeding, fewer hard accelerations can improve fuel economy by up to 30 at highway speeds and 40 in traffic. nbsp AI can also help optimize routes to help your operators avoid traffic congestion or choose more direct routes that minimize fuel use. How AI helps improve driver and fleet safety Oil and gas fleets face unique safety challenges when operating on remote roads and hazardous sites mdash often staffed by a single operator . nbsp AI can provide in-cab alerts that instantly notify drivers when they rsquo re nodding off, making unsafe moves, or not paying attention to the road. AI can even reduce alert fatigue by up to 98 . nbsp Longer term, AI can help fleet managers identify which drivers need coaching to improve their habits. Motive rsquo s Safety Score helps you understand each driver rsquo s risk profile at a glance, while the Motive Driver App delivers automated coaching to the drivers who need it. When paired with occasional in-person coaching , automated coaching can help drivers develop their skills and reduce risky behaviors as they develop. nbsp And when an emergency strikes, AI can deliver safety managers the information they need to act. Motive collects location and telematics data every one to three seconds , even if workers are busy reacting to the situation, helping you respond quickly and precisely. nbsp How AI can boost fleetwide productivity and customer satisfaction Finally, AI can help optimize a fleet rsquo s entire operations, from smart dispatching and maintenance to automating much of the compliance paperwork. nbsp Flying Star Transport has made significant productivity gains thanks to Motive rsquo s AI-fueled solution. CFO Jayson Boydstun says, ldquo Motive rsquo s geofencing and detention time reports helped us realize a 10 to 15 improvement on our efficiencies, measured by hours per load. We gain so much when we can move faster. rdquo nbsp Flying Star is also using Motive rsquo s AI-generated insights to explore ways to improve average wait times and inspire conversations about efficiency with customers and drivers. Minimize wait times and give customers realistic ETAs Motive rsquo s GPS and geofencing give you real-time updates about the location of your drivers, assets, and equipment, so you can track arrivals and departures. These geofences can alert you when equipment enters or exits a site mdash enabling you to proactively send customers an accurate expected arrival time. That can minimize your own driver rsquo s wait time while improving customer satisfaction. nbsp The Motive Fleet Dashboard helps Cordy Environmental build trust with customers. Cordy rsquo s Allen Chatten says, ldquo I showed the customer how to use geofence and telematics on all of our trucks, so she could do a query on her own. The fact that we were able to teach our customer how to do this, well, that just raised our accountability. rdquo Shift to predictive maintenance that limits downtime AI-optimized maintenance also improves overall productivity. Predictive maintenance that rsquo s based on a vehicle rsquo s actual condition and usage can reduce the need for unplanned maintenance. Motive can alert you to diagnostic fault codes as they occur , so you can act before a driver is left on the side of the road with a breakdown mdash and before they miss a delivery. nbsp Predictive maintenance combines sensor data about vibrations, temperature, pressure, and noise to detect early warning signs of malfunction. AI modeling can then predict when a part should be serviced or replaced, before it breaks. On average, fleets that shift to more preventative maintenance cut maintenance-related downtime days by about 20 . nbsp Automate compliance to reduce costs and violations AI can also simplify and streamline your fleet rsquo s compliance, saving hours while reducing violations. For example, AI can resolve unidentified trips faster by automatically matching trips and drivers. Motive rsquo s Compliance Hub and Fleet App make it easy to Identify critical issues and violations. Monitor driver logs and duty status. Match unpaired drivers. Resolve form and manner errors. All that paperwork adds up. When using Motive rsquo s compliance solution , fleets have seen 50 fewer hours-of-service violations. They also spend up to 50 less time on compliance tasks, and have seen as much as a 25 reduction in insurance costs. nbsp Learn how Motive can help oil and gas fleets reach their sustainability goals Motive rsquo s AI-powered solutions can help your oil and gas fleet reduce fuel consumption, improve driver safety, and optimize your productivity.

Keep reading for a front-seat view into the key factors influencing the U.S. economy. nbsp Big Picture Q1 brought mixed signals Q2 is the quarter to watch Freight recession persists. New company formations are up due to lower operating costs but total capacity is contracting as small carriers exit the market. Retail isn rsquo t rebounding. Decline in retail warehouse visits indicates weakness in consumer demand, but surprisingly may also be a sign of recovery in the supply chain. Lower operating costs are contributing to an increase in new trucking company formation The average cost to fill a heavy-duty Class 8 truck tank has decreased by 22 from its 2021 peak of 521 to 403. With operating costs namely fuel still on the decline, companies were motivated to enter the market. However, the second quarter will be critical to observe as rates are gradually rising and inflation is still a concern. New trucking company formation bounced back after Q4 decline but more firms left the market than were created nbsp I In March, 11,000 new trucking companies were formed, contributing to a total of 31,200 in the first quarter, indicating a rebound from the declines seen in Q4. However, despite the increase in new formations, the number of companies leaving the market exceeded the number of new companies created, resulting in a net decrease of approximately 2,000 authorized carriers. This trend suggests the freight recession is getting worse. Retail warehouse visits are still down indicating softness in consumer demand In March, there was an 18 year-over-year decline in the number of big box retail warehouse visits, which follows a 22 year-over-year decrease in February. The decrease in visits to retail warehouses suggests a weakness in consumer demand, but it could also indicate a positive development in the supply chain s recovery. Retailers now have reduced lead times to restock inventory, after experiencing highs in 2021 and 2022. This has given them the confidence to deplete their existing inventories, knowing they can replenish them quickly.

            "Research from ATRI suggests fleets can t afford to wait on deploying driver-facing cameras DFCs . Learn why, and how to get driver buy-in.\n",
            "Commercial fleets have had an interesting relationship with vehicle-based cameras, with a number of fleet operators rushing to the front and adding cameras inside and outside their vehicles. And recent research backs that up mdash in 2021, nearly 3 million camera units were in use, with more than 6 million expected by 2026. nbsp Other fleets have been reluctant to go all-in on cameras. They rsquo ve dipped their toes in with road-facing cameras RFCs while holding back on driver-facing cameras DFCs due to driver pushback over privacy concerns, confusion over how the video will be used, and fear that any driver negligence or distraction will be highlighted. nbsp While those concerns are understandable, the stakes are too high not to deploy DFCs. New research from the American Transportation Research Institute ATRI today supports that stance, showing that fleet leaders can rsquo t wait any longer mdash the risk now outweighs the benefit of avoiding conflict with drivers. nbsp What rsquo s at stake? nbsp One word Liability. Without cameras, a fleet rsquo s exposure to litigation is massive. Lawsuits are defining the landscape of the industry, and simply stated, more coverage is better. The ATRI research suggests that fleets that don t use driver-facing cameras are potentially increasing their liability from accidents. The report also found that DFCs can help mitigate that liability and improve safety for both drivers and fleets. According to legal and insurance experts surveyed for the report, ldquo DFC footage, when available, exonerates drivers in 52 percent of insurance claims and 49 percent of litigation cases as well as leading to settlements in 86 percent of cases versus proceeding to trial. rdquo It rsquo s not just about proof. nbsp DFCs can give fleets the information they need to rectify any risky driving behaviors before they become an issue. The more information that you have about the activity of your fleet, the more engaged and effective you can be when coaching drivers, and the more easily you can develop a defensive strategy for your team. Don rsquo t knock it until you rsquo ve tried it. nbsp Drivers who have never experienced DFCs are understandably wary. But once a driver uses DFCs, approval ratings go up. The report found that ldquo current users rate DFCs more than twice as high as drivers who have never used DFCs. rdquo Driver-facing cameras seem to be the monster under the bed for truckers. All they need to do is take a peek to realize there was never anything to be scared of. Or put simply, the more drivers interact with DFCs, the more they accept them. If you don rsquo t go with DFCs, you better have a really good reason. There rsquo s little doubt that DFCs will become commonplace in trucking just like they are for passenger transportation. So if you decide against DFCs, and you have an incident where video evidence would have been available had you deployed them, you rsquo re going to have to defend your choice, potentially in court. Legal and insurance experts surveyed in the ATRI report suggest fleet operators document the thoroughness of their safety program or highlight the cost of DFCs if they choose not to use them. But even so, there rsquo s no guarantee that those justifications will hold up. Making a case for DFCs. If you re a fleet manager who is considering introducing DFCs, here are some things ATRI suggests keeping in mind Communicate clearly with drivers . One of the biggest concerns drivers have with DFCs is the invasion of privacy. As a fleet manager, it s important to communicate clearly with your drivers about why you re implementing DFCs and how they will be used. Be transparent about how the footage will be accessed and who will have access to it. Set clear policies. It s important to have clear policies in place for how DFC footage will be used. Make sure drivers understand the consequences of violating policies and that policies are consistently enforced. Consider the technology. There are different types of driver-facing camera technology available, each with its own pros and cons. Consider the features that are most important to your fleet, such as video quality, real-time monitoring, and integration with other fleet management systems. Be mindful of driver fatigue. DFCs can be useful in detecting signs of driver fatigue, but it s important to also address the root causes of fatigue. Ensure that drivers are receiving adequate rest breaks and that scheduling is designed to minimize driver fatigue. Train drivers. Provide training for drivers on how to use DFCs and how to respond to alerts generated by the technology. Make sure drivers understand that DFCs are not meant to replace good driving habits and that they still need to be alert and focused on the road. Drivers have a tough job with long hours. And the last thing they want is for someone to be able to watch them while they rsquo re at work or, worse yet, asleep in the back of the cab while off-duty. But fleets can rsquo t sit on this mdash the benefits of DFCs far outweigh any privacy concerns, warranted or not. By communicating clearly with drivers, setting clear policies, considering the technology, addressing driver fatigue, and providing training, fleet managers and safety leaders can introduce DFCs in a way that improves safety, reduces liability, and addresses any concerns drivers may have.

            "A geofence is a virtual perimeter around a particular location or zone. It can be as broad as a country rsquo s border or as narrow as a specific loading dock. Using WiFi, cellular data, RFID, and or GPS data , geofencing software can trigger alerts whenever an asset crosses in or out of a designated boundary. Offering the ability to track assets in real time, a geofence is a useful tool for fleet managers who are looking to improve productivity and gain efficiency. Explore the Motive Tracking amp Telematics solution. Types of geofences A geofence is a digital boundary. You might think of it as a virtual fence that has the added capability of reporting when an asset goes in or out of the boundary. Using a mapping software, you set up a geofence around the target area. It could be a single line e.g., the gate to a plant or warehouse or a collection of coordinates e.g., around an entire construction worksite or the state in which your fleet does business . The fence can also be any shape, whether a square, rectangle, circle, or something irregular. Importance of geofencing Geofences offer many advantages in fleet management . Because drivers don rsquo t have to communicate with the back office, and fleet managers don rsquo t need to have actual eyes on assets, your business can enjoy the following benefits. Reduce administrative burden Reduce or eliminate phone calls between drivers and the back office since geofence data provides real-time updates for fleet managers. Automated alerts can also trigger notifications to customers about delivery arrival times. Knowing drivers are about to reach a drop-off, you may be able to notify the recipient in advance and help speed up processes, increase productivity, and reduce detention time. You might also use geofencing to simplify timekeeping and payroll. Set up a digital, geofenced perimeter around your job sites and get an accurate log of when drivers appeared on their job sites and how long they worked before leaving. Increase asset safety Once you rsquo ve established virtual geofence boundaries, the GPS tracking data can help protect against vehicle and cargo theft as well as unauthorized vehicle use. Fleet managers can be alerted whenever a vehicle deviates from its approved route or an asset is moved from within its virtual boundaries. nbsp Getting a real-time alert as it rsquo s happening can enable you to react more quickly to see whether the incident is authorized or not. This may help you combat cargo and equipment theft. Support compliance Establish geofencing to help you effectively manage traffic restrictions. If your fleet vehicles aren rsquo t meant to be on certain roads at particular hours, you could set up a geofence to alert you of a truck about to enter an off-limits area. Enhance driver safety Keep your drivers safe with geofencing. A geofence is a good way to alert your drivers that they rsquo re about to enter an area you rsquo ve determined is dangerous. Knowing via the geofencing that drivers are at risk of going that way, fleet managers can re-route that vehicle to a safer path. Gain data insights Geofencing isn rsquo t only useful in the moment. The data you get from vehicle tracking and automated alerts can help you see trends. For example, you might identify a shipper or receiver that keeps your trucks longer than competitors. You could decide to avoid the detention time costs in the future by avoiding doing business with that company. How can a geofence be used in fleet management? There are many ways fleet managers can use geofencing technology to simplify and improve fleet management . This section shares sample use cases in which a geofence is beneficial to fleets and their drivers. Geofence use cases in fleet management In the physical economy, vehicles and other equipment are often on the move. Yet you don rsquo t want unauthorized movement and you want to streamline processes. Geofencing helps fleet management in many ways. Construction sites can combat theft of costly equipment with alerts whenever an asset is moved or used unexpectedly. Energy and oil and gas companies can benefit from knowing when field crews arrive or depart from remote sites. Trucking fleets can reduce detention times with alerts, providing advance notification of a pending arrival at a loading dock for shipping or receiving. Delivery companies can use geofencing to trigger notifications to customers for last-mile delivery. Rental companies can know when their vehicles are taken across state lines or international borders. nbsp Business fleets can be confined to assigned zones with alerts that warn drivers and fleet managers of departures from the geofenced area. How do you set up a fleet geofence? To set up a geofence, you rsquo ll need to connect your WiFi, cellular data, GPS, or RFID data to your fleet management software. You rsquo ll set up a virtual perimeter on the software rsquo s digital map. Then, you rsquo ll create alerts when certain actions take place around your designated boundaries. nbsp 1. Choose a geofence solution There are many geofence solutions available today. In selecting the best one for your business needs, you rsquo ll want to consider the software rsquo s ease of use, how the notifications are sent, breadth of data collected, and accuracy. Find out whether your drivers and fleet managers can use the technology conveniently with their iOS and Android devices. nbsp 2. Create a geofence First, find your location on a digital map. Then, set the boundaries for your virtual perimeter. nbsp When creating a geofence in Motive rsquo s dashboard, you can select which entities you want to include e.g., groups, drivers, vehicles, and assets as well. 3. Set up notifications Finally, set up your notification alerts. Typically this is an if-then type of alert. For example, ldquo if X leaves the lot, then email and text Joe. rdquo These could also be specific to a particular time frame, e.g., ldquo if Y equipment moves from this site on weekends, deliver a notification to Janis immediately. rdquo nbsp The geofence software will often let you choose who gets which alerts, how frequently, and whether notifications are by text or email, or both. Motive lets you program alerts to send to external recipients too. Geofencing best practices nbsp Knowing what a geofence is doesn rsquo t mean you know how to make the most of the technology. These best practices can help you see productivity and profitability gains. Define your goals and metrics A good geofencing software is easy to use and makes it simple for you to set up virtual boundaries and alerts. But putting a boundary on everything, and alerting anyone you can think of, can undermine the value of the technology. Have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish with each geofence before you set it up. Then, you rsquo ll better understand which notifications that boundary should trigger and to whom. nbsp Communicate with drivers and employees When setting up a geofence and configuring your alerts, take time to think about who will most benefit from the notifications provided. A good geofence can improve efficiency and productivity for drivers and fleet managers. But they rsquo ll need to get the necessary notifications for your efforts to have real value. If one manager is getting a weekly email summary of data that could be helpful to others in real time, you rsquo re not fully leveraging the power of this software. Review and analyze the geofence data A geofence is a useful way to monitor drivers and your assets in real time. However, that rsquo s not the only advantage of the data you collect. Fleet managers can review and analyze the information gathered to better understand driver behavior and vehicle use. This can help you to streamline operations , simplify processes, and identify opportunities for cost savings e.g., through reduced idle time, avoiding cargo theft, cutting fuel costs . nbsp Improve fleet productivity and equipment utilization Geofencing can increase vehicle, asset, and driver safety. It can also reduce administrative burden, support compliance, and improve customer experience. There is a lot that fleet managers can do with the valuable data and insights gained from geofencing.

Ensure compliance The Motive Driver App is a useful truck driver app for compliance. Take West Coast Distributing WCD , an East Coast meat and produce hauler. With 57 refrigerated vans, WCD was trying hard to protect its CSA score, but relying on manual logs was leaving them open to HOS violations . After months of using the affordable Motive Driver App for simple electronic logging, the company rsquo s safety record was spotless. WCD rsquo s safety and compliance manager, Keith Buchanan, nbsp even wrote customers to tell them about the revamped compliance efforts and saw positive results. He said, ldquo Anytime you can improve safety while keeping an eye on your bottom line, your customers notice. rdquo How do trucking apps affect fleet operations? The best trucking apps prioritize drivers rsquo needs, help simplify tasks, and increase productivity. With driver recruitment and retention so critical to a fleet rsquo s success, an effective Driver App can make a real difference in how drivers feel about working with your fleet. We rsquo ll talk a bit more about how trucking apps affect fleet operations in the next section. Streamline fleet operations The Motive Driver App consolidates important processes and paperwork in one, easy-to-access place.

            "GPS tracking for trucks helps commercial drivers navigate their routes efficiently. At the same time, fleet managers can know where their vehicles are at any moment. This visibility offers many benefits and can improve overall fleet management. nbsp GPS tracking for trucks GPS truck tracking monitors asset and fleet vehicle locations and activities using cellular and satellite technology. When fleet managers can locate vehicles and assets in real time, they can make strategic decisions to shorten loading times, boost daily productivity, estimate fuel consumption and emissions levels, and track asset usage. Get real-time vehicle locations with active GPS tracking from Motive. There are two types of GPS tracking for trucks active GPS and passive GPS. In the active approach, GPS trackers process and send data in real time, providing visibility anytime and anywhere. A passive GPS tracker will gather and send data when triggered e.g., at a time interval or by the arrival or exit of a vehicle through a geofence . Most modern tracking for trucks leverages a combination of both active and passive GPS technology. nbsp How does GPS tracking work? Fleet owners and operators attach a GPS fleet tracker to a commercial vehicle. The tracker identifies the vehicle rsquo s location by connecting and sending data to a group of satellites. By analyzing that location data in relation to the positioning of at least three satellites from the global navigation satellite system GNSS network, vehicle latitude and longitude coordinates are calculated. The GPS tracker data also identifies the time and elevation. A wireless carrier tower picks up the signal and the transmitted coordinates for relay to a cloud server. Fleet tracking or management software connects to that server to access the real-time GPS data that fleets need. 4 benefits of GPS truck tracking A GPS tracking system can do much more than just help drivers get from point A to point B. Consider these four benefits of GPS tracking for fleets . nbsp 1. Increase efficiency and productivity Tracking trucks with GPS provides real-time visibility across fleet operations. This can support productivity by reducing dependency on manual communication. Managers can easily access real-time and historical operational data for drivers, equipment, and vehicles without having to reach out to drivers during their jobs on the road. Knowing where fleet vehicles are by tracking trucks with GPS enables real-time route optimization as well. Anticipating changing weather conditions or noting traffic or accidents on a planned route, managers could reroute vehicles to keep deliveries on schedule. nbsp 2. Improve safety Knowing where the driver is on a route at all times can also alert managers when a fleet vehicle enters a dangerous area to combat vehicle and cargo theft. Geofencing tools provide real-time alerts when a vehicle enters or exits a particular area. nbsp GPS tracking systems for trucks can positively impact driver and road safety. With access to telematics data regarding speed or harsh braking, fleet safety managers can monitor driver behavior. This can help identify drivers who are good candidates for coaching and focus continued training on areas of improvement relevant to individual drivers. 3. Reduce costs GPS tracking data provides access to a real-time, bird rsquo s-eye view, but insights can also be gained from historical location reports. Knowing where vehicles have been, which routes drivers picked, and how long it took them to complete trips makes it possible to optimize future trips. This can help managers identify which routes to avoid e.g., to avoid idling time or high theft-risk areas . By selecting safer, more efficient routes, fleet managers can improve fuel savings, cut maintenance expenses, and counter asset theft . 4. Enhance customer satisfaction Tracking trucks with GPS comes with the added benefits of geofencing and dynamic ETAs. With a geofence around the pickup location and the drop-off destination, customers can be informed of a truck rsquo s progress. nbsp Dynamic ETAs mdash those that continuously update based on current trajectory, traffic, and weather conditions mdash also help provide managers and customers with the most up-to-date information of when to expect a truck. This level of communication can help improve customer relationships. How GPS tracking benefits fleet management With GPS tracking , fleet managers can know exactly where drivers, vehicles, trailers, and equipment are, in real time. This has benefits for all types of commercial vehicles including delivery, passenger transit, construction, oil and gas, and other fleets. nbsp Mohawk Materials , which produces and delivers high-quality concrete and sand across Oklahoma and Kansas, used GPS tracking to upgrade fleet visibility. Being able to track inbound vehicles and start preparing the outbound load for that driver has improved productivity. Plus, using location history, Mohawk is able to track how long employees are at a certain location. This simplifies invoicing and, if a driver is at a facility for over two hours, the company can charge for the extra time. 5 ways GPS truck tracking can improve fleet management Tracking trucks with GPS provides more visibility into fleet vehicles so overall performance can be improved. This section outlines five ways GPS truck tracking helps fleets of all types and sizes become better, smarter, and more effective. 1. Real-time vehicle tracking Real-time nbsp GPS fleet tracking nbsp and location history records can help fleet managers identify if a vehicle is being misused or take quick action if a vehicle deviates from its planned path. Fleet tracking data can also help reduce administrative burden by helping managers know where vehicles and assets are and how long they rsquo ve been there. This location-based data can help the back office easily manage billing, invoicing, and payroll. 2. Route optimization Route optimization requires advanced calculations of many different factors. With GPS tracking data available, a fleet can engage in dynamic routing. Managers can plan routes to meet expected delivery times. Then, with the ability to track where the driver is and estimate when they rsquo ll arrive at their designated stops while avoiding known traffic congestion or inclement weather. Meanwhile, drivers are provided with a full view of the route, each stop along the way, and how long it rsquo ll take to get there. 3. Maintenance scheduling GPS truck trackers can provide a wide range of useful data about fleet vehicles including fuel levels, barometric pressure, battery voltage, coolant temperature, engine intake temperature, engine load, reefer temperature, and more. With this information, scheduling preventative maintenance is simplified . Drawing on utilization reports analysis, managers can take steps to ensure fleet health rather than having to deal with unexpected downtime. nbsp Fault code reports indicate potential issues. In some cases, when immediate attention is needed, a manager could use GPS data to route the vehicle to the closest reliable service. 4. Combat fuel fraud nbsp With GPS truck tracking it rsquo s easier to counter fuel fraud because managers know where each vehicle is and whether it actually needs fuel. nbsp Combining the Motive fleet card with GPS truck tracking, helps managers verify that the truck and card are at the same location. If they rsquo re not, and fuel is purchased, the fleet manager will get a notification about potential fraud. 5. Support compliance Compliance can be simplified when tracking systems integrate with driver hours-of-service data as well. When drivers are notified that they need to take breaks to avoid HOS violations , this system can also suggest the most convenient places for them to rest while on their planned routes. With truck tracking also monitoring refrigerated trailers and retrieving temperature logs, your fleet can easily meet Food Safety Modernization Act nbsp FSMA reefer compliance needs . Integrate GPS tracking systems for trucks in your fleet Real-time visibility into the location, utilization, and health of vehicles, equipment, and assets can transform your fleet.

            "GPS technology is omnipresent today. Companies can find their product in warehouses using GPS. The technology has replaced paper maps for directions. Parents even track their offspring via GPS in our phones. The uses of GPS technology continue to grow. For commercial companies, GPS fleet tracking helps improve productivity, streamline dispatch , secure assets and much more. We rsquo ll discuss various industry applications too in this article exploring fleet tracking solutions and how they help commercial fleets. What is GPS fleet tracking software? Fleet GPS tracking solutions track the location of an object using triangulation. We rsquo ve been using triangulation to locate objects for over one hundred years already. But GPS tracking technology uses satellites in medium-earth orbit to measure distances and give fleet managers live updates in real time. This advanced technology pinpoints specific addresses and provides transparency into vehicle speed and direction. Today rsquo s GPS functions with a latency typically as fast as a few seconds. A 30 second update frequency would be slow, reflecting the vehicle is in a location with slower network connectivity. How does GPS fleet tracking work? GPS tracking devices emit radio signals that use cellular and satellite transmissions. By knowing where that cell tower or satellite is, and measuring the strength of the signal and its direction, fleet vehicle GPS tracking systems can triangulate where that signal originated. This signal is what makes it possible for a commercial fleet manager to determine where a vehicle is, how fast it rsquo s traveling, and its estimated time of arrival. Don rsquo t worry, the manager isn rsquo t doing the actual triangulation, the technology does that and simply serves up the accurate locations and times. You attach a GPS tracker to your commercial fleet vehicle. That transmits data to at least three satellites from the global navigation satellite system GNSS network. This is used to determine the tracker rsquo s distance from the satellites and identify the vehicle rsquo s latitude and longitude coordinates including time and elevation . When you use vehicle GPS tracking systems, you can connect to the cloud server that picks up the transmitted coordinates to gain real-time data about your vehicles. Uses of fleet vehicle GPS tracking GPS fleet tracking offers many benefits for fleet managers and drivers. The many applications for fleet and asset tracking include Live fleet tracking and reporting. With GPS technology, fleet managers can locate vehicles and assets in real time and make more data-informed strategic decisions and to increase asset and vehicle return on investment ROI . Route optimization and planning. Tracking amp monitoring systems can let managers know how long drivers stay at loading docks before moving on. If the duration is too long, the manager can change dispatch expectations or find ways to make pickups to shorten loading time and boost daily productivity. Geofencing. Prevent asset theft and unauthorized use by setting up notifications to alert management if a vehicle or fleet equipment leaves an established boundary. Or, know when assets arrive at a certain location when the fleet tracking shows arrival within a geofenced area . Vehicle health monitoring. GPS fleet tracking isn rsquo t just about location. You can use that accurate data on vehicle movements and locations to better understand fuel consumption and emissions levels, time spent on site, and equipment usage. Benefits of using a GPS fleet tracking software Real-time GPS fleet tracking can help simplify daily fleet operations. When GPS data is paired with fleet management software you can track your fleet and extend visibility into your operations all in one dashboard view. Commercial fleets enjoy several advantages including Improved productivity . Integrating GPS tracking with telematics data about speed, direction, and fault code, you can improve fleet efficiency. The technology also reduces your dependency on phone check-ins and manual communication to keep everything running smoothly, more simply. Enhanced driver and asset safety . Knowing where your drivers, vehicles, and equipment are at all times you can optimize routes to avoid danger areas, bad weather, or traffic. Plus, you rsquo ll know when vehicles or other assets detour from the planned routes and confirm when assets arrive at their intended destination. Simplified compliance . Confirm driver HOS availability, trailer type, and other vehicle details in one, comprehensive data source which also automates workflow and streamlines reporting. Realized cost savings . Improved productivity and fleet efficiency translate to operation gains. Being able to optimize routes to prevent collisions can directly impact the bottom line. So can cutting fuel costs, anticipating maintenance needs , and avoiding valuable asset losses. Boosted customer satisfaction .

Streamline dispatch with the ability to track locations, find drivers by proximity, monitor schedules, and notify receiving clients when they can expect arrival. nbsp Construction Construction fleets can use a fleet GPS system to improve overall efficiency, productivity, and financials. With GPS-based fleet tracking and geofence warnings you can track expensive equipment and prevent thefts . Being able to view the precise locations of every asset and driver can also help improve cycle times and utilization. nbsp Food and beverage Accurate ETAs and optimized routing depend on full visibility into your vehicles and drivers. GPS tracking provides critical delivery information to help managers find the shortest, fastest, most efficient routes in real-time. Customer experience also benefits when food and beverage fleets have GPS-enabled ETA data to draw on to communicate scheduled arrival. nbsp Delivery ldquo When will my package be delivered? rdquo That rsquo s the million dollar question delivery fleets face every day, with every order. Late deliveries are a major concern. Yet with GPS trackers on fleet vehicles, you can know exactly where vehicles are and communicate with customers exactly when to expect delivery. With accurate, real-time information, you can also optimize routes on the fly to save fuel and time. Passenger transit Passenger transit is another industry where customers want to know exactly when to expect to be picked up and dropped off at their destination. GPS function improves communication and provides greater accuracy for better customer service. Fleet managers can optimize asset utilization as well with the monitoring tools making it possible to find the nearest driver, track locations, share details, and message drivers to coordinate smooth trips. nbsp Agriculture With agriculture , assets can be spread out with monitoring challenged by location and conditions. Yet, GPS tracking protects equipment and vehicles from misuse and theft by providing accurate, real-time insights on everything, anywhere, in a dashboard view. Rely on this technology to simplify deliveries with the benefit of the full picture on road conditions, weather, and more to anticipate delays or reroute drivers as needed. Limitations and challenges of GPS technology As with any technology, there are some limitations and challenges that need to be addressed with GPS fleet tracking. For one, securing the satellite system and GPS tracking data requires ongoing attention. Cyber attackers are always on the lookout for new targets. Another fear is that a foreign entity or other bad actor might find a way to jam the GPS signals. However, the federal government, military agencies, and other entities are all intent on protecting GPS communications and finding alternatives to provide backup in the event of an issue. nbsp GPS signal failure is a more commonplace challenge. No ill-intentioned individual needs to be involved. It could simply be a mountain in the way. Or being too far from the receiving tower or satellite. Still, new additions to the satellite and cellular infrastructure are always helping while manufacturers simultaneously work to enhance signal deliverability. Fleet GPS trackers are also power gobblers, yet they are typically solar or battery operated. At the same time, they must be manufactured compactly in order to be mobile.

            "Commercial drivers and fleet managers know the importance of compliance. They also know the administrative headaches that can come with meeting compliance. Yet sometimes they encounter unidentified trips. This means the back office has to do some sleuthing, and figuring out who drove a specific vehicle can be time-consuming and tedious. Motive rsquo s AI Trip Assignment feature maximizes productivity by saving fleet managers from doing this kind of manual work. Motor carriers and drivers are required to maintain records of duty status RODS . The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association FMCSA calls for every driver to prepare logs containing driving totals for every 24-hour period. RODS require drivers to log Date Vehicle number Total driving hours Total miles driven in the 24 hours logged Carrier rsquo s name Starting time for the 24-hour period Address Driver rsquo s certification or signature Remarks, when necessary Failure to comply could lead to costly violations. A non-record-keeping penalty can reach as much as 15,876 3,969 for drivers . Unfortunately, many fleets will still face unidentified trips. The consumer demand for businesses to deliver quickly while maintaining the same quality of service has forced fleets to their limits in order to remain competitive. At the same time, the shortage of drivers exacerbated by the pandemic makes recruiting and retaining qualified drivers more difficult. These conditions can make record-keeping more challenging, and the consequences aren rsquo t good. nbsp Ultimately, the back office spends too much time manually matching trips and drivers, drivers get more violations , fleet compliance suffers, and compliance, safety, and accountability CSA scores rise. This can cause insurance rates to go up and customers to leave. It all means unidentified trips can rsquo t be ignored. What are unidentified trips? As part of electronic logging device ELD regulations, drivers and commercial fleets must account for all time that a vehicle rsquo s speed is above five miles per hour. Motor carriers must account for all unassigned trips from their ELDs. They either need to assign the time to the correct driver or explain why the time is unassigned. Manually assigning these events can be time-consuming and takes away from other revenue-generating activities. nbsp Motor carriers must also retain records of unidentified trips for at least six months as a part of its hours of service HOS ELD records , and make them available to authorized safety officials. AI Trip Assignment simplifies driving records Many fleets are upgrading from unreliable, legacy ELDs to fleet management technology that simplifies compliance for drivers and the back office. The Motive Compliance Hub provides a complete view of fleet compliance health and allows users to nbsp Manage data easily with full fleet visibility. Identify critical issues with proactive CSA monitoring. Resolve violations faster. Stay compliant from anywhere. Motive created AI Trip Assignment to simplify processes, save time, and reduce violations through automation. Motive is the first fleet management provider to offer this type of tool, and the benefits are already apparent. In the first quarter of the tool rsquo s launch to Enterprise customers, AI Trip Assignment feature helped Automatically resolve 15 of all unidentified trips. Save fleet managers 15-60 minutes daily. nbsp How does AI Trip Assignment work? The AI Trip Assignment tool improves back office productivity by automatically identifying unidentified trips. Our proprietary AI models analyze historical patterns including vehicle inspections, GPS data , and last-known driver to automatically assign unidentified trips to the right driver. Fleet managers can see the recommended driver for the trip in their Fleet Dashboard. Drivers can accept or reject the automatic log edit suggestion in their Driver App. While other fleet management offerings may provide visibility into unidentified trips, they don rsquo t automate matching. Instead, the matching is still done manually by the fleet manager or dispatcher. nbsp Motive customers can also still manually match drivers and vehicles. Simply disable the automatic assignment feature from Company Settings gt Driver Identification Settings . nbsp When disabled, Motive will continue to display AI-suggested drivers in the Trips and Trips Detail pages. However, trips will require manual assignment by the fleet manager. How to avoid unidentified trips The easiest thing to do is avoid unidentified trips in the first place. Start by communicating to drivers that they do more than just drive a truck. Their administrative work is key. Trying to recall driving status after the fact can be challenging. High-quality ELD devices make driver status updates fast and simple. You rsquo ll also need to keep up to date on requirements from FMCSA to avoid violations. nbsp The right fleet management tool can help with that too, as it will update and keep you informed as regulations change. Modern, AI-backed fleet management Automating compliance management can help your back office expedite routine tasks and quickly address compliance issues. And the AI Trip Assignment is only one benefit you rsquo ll gain with Motive rsquo s Compliance Hub. You can also simplify IFTA reporting with automatic tracking of mileage and fuel by jurisdiction and digital management of fuel receipts. Tracking and sharing your forecasted CSA scores can help reduce audit risk, lower insurance rates , and earn more business. Plus, by pairing CSA scores with driving data, safety scores, and external contextual data, compliance managers can better identify drivers who need further coaching and training. Drivers see the advantages, too.

            "Fleet management is a critical aspect of running a business that relies on transportation. It involves coordinating and organizing a range of activities, from vehicle maintenance to fuel management. One of the most important tools in a fleet manager s arsenal is the fleet card. In this article, we ll take a closer look at cards for commercial fleets, including the basics and the benefits of using a dedicated fleet card . What are fleet cards? Fleet cards are payment cards that are designed specifically for commercial fleets. They are issued to fleet managers and their drivers and are used to pay for fuel, maintenance, and other expenses associated with operating a fleet of vehicles. Fleet cards are accepted at a network of service stations, repair shops, and other authorized vendors, but are often closed loop , meaning the card can only be used at a specific vendor for a specific use, e.g., fuel purchases. Some cards are more widely accepted and can be used anywhere a regular credit card is accepted. Benefits of using a dedicated fleet card 1. Improved cost control One of the most significant benefits of using a fleet card is that it enables fleet managers to gain greater control over fuel and maintenance costs. These cards typically offer detailed reporting that enables managers to track expenses in real time, allowing them to identify areas of overspending or inefficiencies. This, in turn, allows them to make data-driven decisions to reduce costs. 2. Streamlined spend management Certain fleet cards can streamline spend management by eliminating the need for drivers to carry cash or personal credit cards. This reduces the administrative burden on fleet managers, who can easily reconcile expenses and monitor activity on the card. However, if a card can only be used for fuel, managers must either rely on a second card or rely on a reimbursement process for non-fuel expenses like maintenance, tires, or incidentals. nbsp With most fleet cards, managers can also set up spending limits, purchase restrictions, and other controls to prevent unauthorized spending. 3. Enhanced security and fraud prevention Fleet cards also offer enhanced security features that are not available with traditional credit cards. They can be restricted to specific vendors or fuel types, and they often require driver identification and PIN codes to complete transactions. This makes them less susceptible to fraud and misuse although it doesn rsquo t stop fraud entirely . Card fraud is a growing problem for fleets. Modern fleet card issuers recognize the impact fraud can have on a business and have incorporated telematics and mobile capabilities to enhance security and help prevent instances of friendly fraud and third-party fraud. Want to learn more about how Motive Card can help you save on fuel, maintenance, and more? Click here to explore our no-hidden-fee fleet card! 4. Access to discounts and rebates Many fleet card programs offer discounts and rebates on fuel purchases, which can help to offset the cost of operating a fleet. These can add up to significant savings over time, particularly for larger fleets. Unfortunately, they are also commonly offset by hidden fees that can quickly erase or even outweigh discount savings. It rsquo s important to understand what, if any, fees a program charges. It may require a fleet manager to sift through the fine print of their card agreement, as these fees, and how they rsquo re triggered, are often hidden. Some fleet cards offer no hidden fees and a vast network of locations that offer significant discounts. 5. Improved cash flow Fleet cards can also help to improve cash flow by offering flexible payment terms and eliminating the need for drivers to pay out of pocket for expenses. This can be particularly beneficial for smaller fleets or businesses that are just starting out. 6. Cash advances Some fleet cards offer drivers cash advances to drivers, so they can make personal purchases while on the road. Those expenses are usually deducted from the driver rsquo s pay but this benefit is convenient for drivers who don rsquo t want to carry a personal card or cash. This increases driver flexibility and helps with worker retention. nbsp 7. Productivity improvements Modern fleet cards integrate with other business systems to increase productivity by automating activities like tax calculation and filing, bookkeeping, fuel route optimization, and other manual processes, all resulting in time and cash savings. Are fleet cards right for my business? Fleet cards are an essential tool for any business that operates a fleet of vehicles, and can help businesses save thousands of dollars per vehicle per year through fuel discounts and productivity enhancements. They offer a range of benefits, from improved cost control and streamlined spend management, to enhanced security and access to discounts and rebates. If you re looking to improve your fleet management practices, consider investing in a dedicated fleet card program .

            "Traffic had slowed to a crawl, then to a stop. While most drivers realized traffic was at a standstill, one commercial driver did not. nbsp ldquo The driver wasn rsquo t paying attention, rdquo says Diane Woodruff, DOT Compliance and Safety Manager at Sabel Steel . ldquo They took out about six vehicles in their path, including ours. It was raining. There were accidents everywhere. They were going way too fast. In instances just like this, distracted driving claimed 3,522 lives in 2021 . Each of these deaths could have been prevented if drivers had kept their eyes on the road. nbsp Commercial workers who spend any length of time driving during the workday are exposed to distracted driving all the time. Sometimes it rsquo s the work of others. Other times, themselves. While fleets can rsquo t keep workers out of harm rsquo s way completely, they can use dual-facing dash cams to root out distracted driving. nbsp As Distracted Driving Awareness Month winds to a close, here rsquo s how Motive customers are using the Motive AI Dashcam to prevent distracted driving and create safer roads. Dual-facing dash cams lsquo instrumental rsquo to curbing distracted driving At Texas-based AJL International , training and DOT Compliance Manager Shannon Vaught implemented Motive dual facing AI Dashcams in the company s fleet of executive buses and cars just over a year ago. Rolling out Motive AI Dashcams was among the first decisions that were made upon Vaught joining AJL. ldquo We implemented Motive AI Dashcams to set more targeted safety goals and let the data drive our focus, rdquo Vaught says. ldquo We did not have access to much data at the time. We also wanted more visibility into safety performance in real time. The Motive dual-facing AI Dashcams delivered that for us. rdquo The Motive AI Dashcam has been pivotal to bringing distracted driving to the forefront in commercial fleets. For AJL, the AI Dashcam captures cell phone use, speeding, and lack of seat belt use most frequently. nbsp Detect unsafe driving with unrivaled accuracy with the Motive AI Dashcam. With its newly enhanced distraction detection capabilities , the Motive AI Dashcam alerts drivers whenever they look down for more than five seconds at speeds faster than 10 mph. Drivers may look down due to drowsiness, cell phone use, smoking, eating, or general inattentiveness. nbsp Whatever the reason, the AI Dashcam recognizes and alerts to distraction almost instantly. With the accuracy of Motive rsquo s artificial intelligence , fleet managers can feel confident knowing that when there rsquo s an alert, there rsquo s a distraction. ldquo I don rsquo t know how we would curb distracted driving without the dual-facing AI Dashcam, rdquo Vaught says. ldquo It rsquo s been instrumental in rooting out unsafe behaviors in our fleet. I don rsquo t know how you could monitor distracted driving without it. rdquo Video-based coaching the key to safer performance According to the National Distracted Driving Coalition , dual-facing dash cams help stop distracted driving in real time, reducing the risk of injury or death. The NDDC s article How Technology Can Help Reduce Driver Distraction rdquo points to a study commissioned by U.S. Department of Transportation . The study shows that dash cams and driver coaching work in tandem to reduce the frequency and severity of unsafe events. For Vaught, automated coaching through the Motive Driver App is the first line of defense. Whenever a distracted driving event takes place, the dash cam video is automatically sent to the driver through the Driver App. The driver can then review the video, along with personalized coaching tips that help them improve. nbsp ldquo Automated coaching with Motive is awesome, rdquo Vaught says, ldquo It makes things so much quicker when you have as many drivers and vehicles as we do. The only thing I have to do is make sure drivers are logging in to the Motive Driver App and following up on the messages and notifications in there. Not having to coach in person saves me a lot of time. rdquo nbsp However, Vaught does coach in person when a driver continues to demonstrate unsafe behavior. The in-person session helps him review safety best practices with the driver. Education and growth via dash cam footage When distracted driving is captured on the AI Dashcam, Vaught uses the video clips as educational tools. When one driver was caught using an iPad, for example, Vaught aired the video in the break room as an example of behavior to avoid. ldquo Over time, drivers have become more appreciative of the AI Dashcam as a growth tool, rdquo he says. At Sabel Steel, Woodruff has ramped up her safety messaging in support of Distracted Driving Awareness Month. ldquo I tell my team, lsquo When you rsquo re driving and you re thinking about picking up your phone, treat it like your family is in the car ahead. You re working for us, you re driving our truck. But safety is your responsibility. rsquo God forbid you get distracted, hit somebody, and injure them or worse. I mean, that s something you have to live with. rdquo Don rsquo t settle for distracted driving in your fleet Download our fleet safety coaching guide and start building a safety culture today. Distracted driving by the numbers Did you know that hellip 8 of fatal vehicle-related accidents involve distracted driving According to Forbes, ldquo while this is a far lower percentage of crashes than impaired driving, which accounts for approximately 30 of all fatal accidents, it still reflects the extreme risk presented by driver distraction . rdquo 324,652 were injured in accidents due to distracted driving in 2020 Not all distracted driving crashes are fatal. But driver inattention can also result in collisions that cause serious injury. The toll of driver distraction is far greater when considering crashes that caused injury but were not fatal. In fact, 324,652 people were hurt in distracted driving crashes in 2020. Cell phone use is involved in 12 of road-related accidents While there are many causes of driver distraction, cell phones remain a major obstacle to focused driving. The National Traffic Safety Administration reports that phone use is involved in 12 of all car accidents on U.S. roadways . Distracted driving happens most between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. Distracted driving is a problem at all hours, but inattention increases in the evening. ldquo In fact, between 6 and 11 p.m., drivers were distracted for an average of 1 56 minutes per driving hour , rdquo Forbes writes. nbsp Distracted driving happens least between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. There is some good news. Drivers are typically more focused on the road during their morning commute. Between the hours of 6 and 9 a.m., motorists are distracted for only an average of 1 04 minutes per hour of driving . This is nearly half as much time for unfocused driving as evening hours. Taking your eyes off the road for 5 seconds at 55 mph is equivalent to traveling the length of a football field without looking ldquo Many drivers don rsquo t realize how far they can travel even when distracted for a brief period, rdquo Forbes writes. ldquo The reality is, motorists can drive the equivalent of an entire football field blind if they take their eyes off the road for just five seconds when they are traveling at 55 mph. With so much ground covered, it rsquo s not a surprise that the risks of a crash are high when motorists lose focus. rdquo Source rdquo Distracted Driving Statistics and Facts in 2023, rdquo Forbes, Feb. 23, 2023.\n",

            "Welcome to the May edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report, where we analyze the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform during the past month. Keep reading for a front-seat view into the key factors influencing the U.S. economy. nbsp Big Picture Freight recession or reversion to the mean? Early signs indicate a return to pre-pandemic norms. The trucking industry is rebalancing, with some regions experiencing bigger drops in carrier exits. Southern states like Texas and Florida have seen the most losses, but this may be a return to normal following their 2021 growth. Overall, the freight market is shrinking, but new companies are still forming in line with six-month averages. In the retail sector, major distribution hubs are seeing more visits, but the top 50 retailers are not rushing to fill inventory as they have in previous years. Regional view of market contraction shows the bigger the pandemic pop, the steeper the commensurate correction While the April data showed a sharper decline in the number of carriers nationwide compared to March -4,000 , new regional and state-level data show these losses were not even across the country. Southern states like Texas and Florida, which saw the largest gains during the industry rsquo s pandemic highs, are seeing a similarly stark contraction. The ten states with the highest number of carriers all saw retraction with the exception of slight growth in Indiana. However, the fall across the overall market has not been precipitous, indicating the market may be moving toward more stability. The freight market rsquo s rebalancing continues Despite new fleets being added in aggregate nationally, new company formations declined again in April, dropping 17 compared to March. The freight recession is continuing when compared to pandemic highs, but it s likely more of a rebalancing given the fact that the 27 year-over-year industry growth seen in 2021 was almost quintuple the 10-year average of 5.6 . Carrier start data is also showing resilience, with starts remaining in line with the rolling six-month average. This indicates there are still businesses seeing enough opportunity to enter the market. It rsquo s critical to monitor Q2 to see if the recession is indeed a recession or a reversion to the mean. Top 50 retailers see more warehouse visits, but aren rsquo t rushing nbsp to fill inventories Motive rsquo s Retail Freight Index now includes the top 50 retailers by revenue The top 50 retailers by revenue saw more visits to major distribution facilities in April, which is typical coming out of Q1. But unlike the past two years, retailers are not rushing to fill inventory, and this trend is expected to continue throughout Q2. This may mean that inventory purchasers have more modest expectations for the coming quarter, as consumer demand falls and supply chain health improves. Key takeaway nbsp Efficiency and flexibility are key as pandemic-related swings disrupted previous norms and retailers aren t rushing to restock inventories. Some regions are seeing larger market swings. Therefore, carriers must take both a macro and localized approach to assess demand in real time. nbsp Data Methodology The Motive Monthly Economic Report uses aggregated and anonymized insights from the Motive network, as well as publicly available government data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and U.S. Department of Transportation.\n",

            "Lana Nichols learned early on to put her mind to something and get after it. nbsp ldquo Seeing my mom work long, hard hours while juggling her role as a wife and mother inspired me, rdquo Nichols says as she prepares for Mother rsquo s Day. Nichols worked her way through college, taking shifts at the same factory where her mom worked. Later, she earned an MBA and moved out West. As Vice President of Women In Trucking , Nichols, and the entire WIT organization, are celebrating Mother rsquo s Day in the best way they know how by showing support for mom drivers and participating in the Make-A-Wish Mother rsquo s Day Truck Convoy . As a first-time participant in the annual fundraiser for critically ill children, Women In Trucking will showcase a wrapped educational trailer from its WITney outreach program . It rsquo ll be driven by a mom driver from the Women In Trucking Image Team . nbsp The WITney program ldquo Our WITney program educates and amplifies how a career in trucking can be rewarding for women, including moms, rdquo Nichols says. ldquo The trailer reads lsquo Safe, strong, independent, rsquo because that rsquo s the kind of confidence we want to inspire in our members and those aspiring to hold careers in the trucking industry. rdquo The WITney program works to minimize obstacles for women drivers. Advertisements and videos highlighting women can help recruitment efforts just as much as seeing women climb into the cab. ldquo When they see others like them driving mdash and driving well mdash it helps attract more women, including moms, to the industry, rdquo Nichols says. ldquo They rsquo re doing what they love and providing for their families. rdquo Women and the trucking industry WIT estimates that 13.7 of drivers are women , 3 more than in 2019. The percentage grows every year, but there rsquo s more work to do. For the moms among them who value and need as much home time as possible, employment options are growing. Regional and local jobs are a good fit, offering regular hours and the chance to be home nights and weekends. For moms who have a hard time being away from their kids, any time spent at home is welcome. To attract more diverse talent, fleets are working to provide a better work-life balance for moms in their ranks. ldquo I speak to so many women who were struggling single parents or needed to contribute to their family financially and found a really successful truck driving career, rdquo Nichols says. ldquo There is a place for them out here. rdquo It rsquo s a place where moms can grow, advance, and feel empowered. Women tend to be safe drivers, risk-averse, and dedicated. And carriers are seeing that in their performance. How can fleets recruit more women? Fleets looking to recruit women should know that they value a positive work culture, flexibility, and longevity with their employer . All of this is becoming more common as companies diversify their workforce. Safety continues to be a concern for all drivers on the road, and women should take extra precautions. Nichols suggests parking at well-lit truck stops being vigilant and avoiding distraction. She also recommends that drivers use safety technology to their advantage. nbsp In closing, Nichols wants moms to know how much they rsquo re appreciated. ldquo Happy Mother rsquo s Day to all the moms, grandmoms, aunts, friends, and supporters out there, working hard and getting it done, rdquo says the mom of four. ldquo We rsquo re behind you and grateful for all you do. rdquo Moms on the road this Sunday should head to TravelCenters of America for a free dessert.

            "Not all fleet cards are created equal. Some should be avoided like roadwork during rush hour. Discover 10 essential attributes of a fleet card.\n",
            "In today s fast-paced fleet environment, effective spend management is crucial for optimizing operations and controlling costs. One tool that has become indispensable for any business that operates vehicles is the fleet card , which streamlines fuel and maintenance expenses while providing valuable insights into fleet spending. However, not all fleet cards are created equal . And some should be avoided like roadwork during rush hour. This article covers 10 essential attributes that fleet managers, CFOs, and business owners should consider when choosing a fleet card. nbsp 10 essential fleet-card attributes 1. Low fees and fee transparency A fleet card with low fees and transparent pricing is essential for responsible fleet managers. Look for a provider that offers low or no transaction or account management fees, and no hidden charges. This may require you to ask some tough questions or take a deep dive into the fine print of card agreements, but it rsquo ll be worth it in the long run. Clear fee structures allow you to accurately forecast expenses and avoid unpleasant surprises. Many cards charge hidden fees that can rapidly multiply in the event of a payment failure or credit change, resulting in big unexpected expenses when they are least welcome. nbsp 2. Discounts and rebates Find a card that offers a discount or rebate program for your biggest fleet spending categories. These programs can help offset costs by providing cashback, discounts on fuel and maintenance purchases, and special deals with partner merchants. Look for discounts at quality vendors to ensure you rsquo re saving where drivers want to fill up. This increases driver retention and ensures that you rsquo ll take advantage of discounts, as drivers will be happy to fuel where you save. These discounts can make a huge difference for fleets, especially now, during times of compressed margins. nbsp See how you can save on fuel, maintenance, and more with the Motive Card. 3. Advanced fraud prevention Fraudulent transactions can be a significant concern for fleet managers. Industry experts believe that 3 to 5 or more of fleet card spend can be attributed to fraud or unauthorized spending. A robust fleet card must offer advanced fraud prevention features. These include Real-time fraud monitoring nbsp Cards that are locked by default nbsp Telematics integration for GPS and fuel detection nbsp Card-level purchase restrictions nbsp The ability to immediately suspend or deactivate cards in case of suspected misuse These fraud mitigation features ensure that your fleet s finances are safeguarded against third-party scammers or ldquo friendly fraud rdquo from cardholders. 4. Detailed and customizable spend controls Every fleet has unique requirements when it comes to spending controls. A fleet card should offer granular controls that enable fleet managers to Set specific purchase limits by amount, day, and time nbsp Restrict purchases to certain merchant categories nbsp Automatically enforce spending policies nbsp The ability to customize these controls easily ensures that the card aligns with your fleet s unique needs. These controls should be changeable by the fleet manager in real time in case a driver has a legitimate out-of-policy spending need like a rental car or tow. nbsp 5. Integration with fleet management systems If your fleet already utilizes a fleet management system , consider a fleet card that integrates seamlessly with it. This lets you manage your fleet and spending in a single window. Integration enables automatic data transfer between systems, reducing manual data entry and improving accuracy. It strengthens features like automated fraud detection, fuel efficiency tracking, and IFTA automation . It also provides a holistic view of fleet operations, making it easy to track expenses and optimize efficiency. 6. Cardholder decline messaging If a cardholder finds themselves stranded with a declined card, it rsquo s annoying at best and potentially dangerous. No fleet manager wants to be woken up in the middle of the night by a cardholder calling to ask why they can rsquo t make a purchase. This situation often results in a call to the card company and time spent waiting for support. Look for cards that send managers and cardholders detailed alerts about declines, allowing cardholders to solve decline issues on their own, get moving faster, and save the back-office hassle. nbsp 7. Universal acceptance network Ensure that your card is widely accepted across a vast network of fuel stations, maintenance providers, and other merchants. A broad acceptance network eliminates the need for drivers to deviate from their routes in search of specific locations, making fueling more convenient and efficient. It also allows your fleet to take advantage of the cheapest providers available. Furthermore, drivers won rsquo t have to pay out of pocket and collect receipts to execute reimbursements. Finally, it ensures that you can use your card on maintenance, parts, and other business expenses that other cards don rsquo t support. nbsp 8. Online and app-based account management Look for a fleet card that provides a user-friendly online account management platform. This allows fleet managers to monitor transactions in real time, review invoices, easily report on spending, manage cards, and update account settings conveniently from anywhere. Seamless online account management simplifies administrative tasks and saves valuable time. 9. Driver-friendly features Fleet cards shouldn rsquo t only benefit fleet managers. They should make life easier for drivers too. Look for features like mobile apps that provide real-time transaction information, easy-to-use expense tracking, and convenient access to account details. Driver-friendly features improve transparency and empower drivers to better manage their fueling and maintenance needs. In a tight labor market, and in an industry with cherished driver relationships, employee happiness and retention are critical to success. nbsp 10. Excellent customer support Reliable customer support is crucial when dealing with any service provider. Choose a fleet card provider that offers responsive customer support channels, including phone, email, and live chat. A dedicated support team can quickly address issues or questions, ensuring smooth operations and minimal disruptions in the event of a stoppage or card decline. nbsp The right fleet card Selecting the right fleet card is a critical decision for managers and fleet owners. Businesses with fleets can choose a fleet card that optimizes operations, controls costs, and provides valuable spending insights by considering these essential attributes nbsp nbsp Low fees and fee transparency nbsp Advanced fraud prevention nbsp Decline messaging nbsp Detailed and easily customizable spend controls nbsp A wide acceptance network nbsp Online account management, nbsp Integration with fleet management systems nbsp Driver-friendly features nbsp Excellent customer support nbsp Discounts Each fleet has unique requirements, so it s essential to assess your specific needs and prioritize attributes that align with your goals. By doing so, you ll be equipped with a fleet card that not only meets your fleet s needs but also empowers you to make informed decisions. Along the way, you rsquo ll improve efficiency and streamline your fleet management processes.

            "From construction to oil and gas, workers are being encouraged to voice their concerns without fear of retaliation. Psychological safety has been a focus in several industries. Now it rsquo s gaining traction in the physical economy too. Whether workers are worried about jobsite hazards or something else, employers want to know about it mdash before it jeopardizes safety or production. The merits of this new safety trend have been widely publicized everywhere from Fast Company to McKinsey . But what does psychological safety entail? And how can it lead to a more engaged workforce? nbsp Studies have shown that improving psychological safety can lead to a 12 increase in productivity. According to Google s research on what constitutes a successful team, it rsquo s the most crucial factor in determining a team s success. In this article, we explain why psychological safety should be a top priority for your organization and how it can improve worksite and road safety. Read Drive success in construction fleet management . What is psychological safety? Employees in psychologically safe environments speak up, admit mistakes, and have confidence mdash all because they rsquo ve been given the freedom to voice concerns without retaliation. Along the way, they become less focused on themselves and more focused on the good of the team. As Construction Executive magazine puts it, ldquo psychological safety creates an environment where team members can talk openly or ask for help , allowing them to get the support they need to effectively perform. rdquo nbsp An apprentice, for example, can voice inexperience to field management and receive proper training. A contractor can find resources to address health concerns without worry. nbsp ldquo When employees feel psychologically safe, they rsquo re more likely to defend themselves and others who face bullying and harassment, rdquo says Kevin Cannon, Senior Director of Safety and Health Services for The Associated General Contractors of America AGC . ldquo Voicing concerns has the potential to impact several other outcomes, including safety performance. rdquo Why psychological safety is often low among contractors Today rsquo s construction crews ldquo struggle with serious problems that erode the effectiveness of teams, rdquo Construction Executive writes. There rsquo s harassment on jobsites, labor shortages , high-risk situations, and a suicide rate that rsquo s four times the national average . Challenges like these contribute to presenteeism on the jobsite, meaning workers are present but not fully functioning. That rsquo s often due to illness, depression, exhaustion, or fear. As the Great Resignation continues, workers who feel they can rsquo t voice their concerns may be more likely to seek employment elsewhere. ldquo These employees create a greater risk of physical injury for the rest of the crew, rdquo Construction Executive writes . ldquo This could be due to their distraction from the task at hand, or because they rsquo re afraid to speak up. Either way, field management loses team buy-in, innovation, and proactive safety practices, resulting in the likelihood that not all crew members will demonstrate the safest and most productive behaviors. rdquo Firms can counter these challenges by offering teams a greater sense of psychological safety. Here rsquo s where to start. Encourage workers to speak up ldquo Engaged workers are those who bring recommendations to management. That rsquo s what engagement is, rdquo Cannon says. ldquo When workers raise a concern that would make for a safer, more productive process and their words are received, they rsquo ll feel more comfortable speaking up in the future. rdquo Frontline workers may actually have the best insight into how to complete a task safely. So use daily ldquo toolbox talks rdquo on the jobsite and other gatherings as opportunities to listen and learn. ldquo The more you can keep workers engaged, the more they rsquo ll feel that they have a voice, rdquo Cannon says. ldquo When workers provide input that makes the process safer and more productive, the company can use that knowledge to enhance policies going forward. rdquo National Safety Council statistician Ken Kolosh encourages firms to remember the importance of buy-in at every level. ldquo Every employee owns safety, not just managers, rdquo he says. ldquo Getting everyone involved is really where it works best. rdquo Commit to a ldquo Culture of CARE rdquo AGC devised its ldquo Culture of CARE rdquo curriculum to encourage DEI efforts among its members. CARE stands for commit, attract, retain, empower. ldquo A culture of care ensures that everyone, regardless of their background, feels welcome and heard, rdquo says Cannon. A caring culture shows concern for worker safety at every level. That concern might be expressed in written communication, conversation, or well-designed fleet safety policies . ldquo A company that cares doesn rsquo t just commit to the general idea of safety, rdquo Cannon says. ldquo They do whatever it takes to ensure that employees return home safely every night. rdquo Use coaching sessions to build rapport A recent study nbsp of psychological safety in the coach-athlete relationship showed that the more freedom athletes had to be transparent with coaches, the greater their sense of psychological safety proved to be. Transparency also strengthened the relationship between athletes and coaches and helped to build trust. If this is true in sport, it rsquo s also true in construction. When a contractor exhibits unsafe behavior, they rsquo ll have an easier time owning their safety lapses in a coaching environment that encourages openness, respect, and accountability. Construction firms can use coaching as an opportunity to build psychological safety among workers. Conversations don rsquo t even have to be in person. As workforces have become more remote, coaching has too. nbsp Proactive safety tools like the Motive AI-powered safety platform allow contractors to self-coach right from their smartphones. Managers can follow up with contractors however they choose, reinforcing safe driving behavior virtually or in person. Help people live their purpose at work ldquo Knowing your purpose at work is the most important step in developing psychological safety, rdquo a CNBC article on the topic nbsp states. In other words, help workers understand why their work matters in the broader scope of your company and the world. Connecting safety to brand reputation or a stronger bottom line helps workers see that their efforts help everyone. A nbsp recent McKinsey report nbsp shows that 63 of people surveyed said they want their employer to provide more opportunities for purpose in their day-to-day work. With a labor shortage continuing from one year to the next, construction firms would be wise to find ways to deliver. Otherwise, they risk losing the valuable talent they already have. nbsp Some companies offer community service programs or paid time off for workers to pursue their passions. ldquo While such efforts are laudable, and even beneficial, your starting point should be opportunities that help employees find more personal meaning in their day-to-day work, rdquo McKinsey says. Employees will feel more fulfilled, and your company will benefit too. Unlock your team rsquo s potential with Motive Empowering your people starts with you.

            "Dash cam video can help fleets improve driver safety, reduce liability, enhance efficiency, and gain insights into fleet performance. Yet fleet managers relying on this essential tool often settle for the minimum recording time. Learn the benefits instead of having access to longer fleet dash cam videos to support operational success. Why longer fleet dash cam videos matter Often installed on a vehicle rsquo s dashboard or windshield, dash cams are road-facing, driver-facing , and or dual-facing that record the road and the driver. And many dash cams, regardless of which way they face, default to short recording times. nbsp However, there are many advantages gained when you have access to Motive rsquo s default of 15 seconds of video rather than a shorter recording e.g., seven seconds or less . Fleets have comprehensive evidence and better insights with longer clips, which can help enhance safety and improve driver behavior. Detect unsafe driving with unrivaled accuracy and speed. Comprehensive evidence With dash cams for trucks offering longer clips, you don rsquo t just see the few seconds of an event. You can also see what happened immediately before and after the event. When you have only a short, seven-second video, you might see the driver swerve on the road. By doubling that to show 15 seconds of driver behavior, you can also see they were getting out of the way of an obstacle on the road. nbsp This kind of contextualization can provide a clearer picture of what happened, which can be helpful in exonerating drivers and avoiding nuclear verdicts. Plus, this bigger picture can help managers make more informed decisions about how to coach and train drivers. Better insights Having more data for analysis from a longer video can give managers insight into unsafe driving behaviors such as hard braking, hard cornering, rapid acceleration, or speeding. With the enhanced visibility, you can take corrective action to improve driver safety and reduce the likelihood of accidents, which can save your company money and potentially even lives. A longer video might also help fleet managers identify areas on a route that consistently causes delays or increased fuel consumption. With the added information to identify a trend, fleets can make changes to optimize performance. Enhanced safety The more you know, the easier it is to identify potential safety hazards. With longer dash cam videos at your disposal, without having to request them from the manufacturer, you not only can see what led to a behavior but also how the driver reacts. You rsquo ll also have more time to observe road conditions or other factors that could be addressed in driver coaching . For example, with longer dash cam videos you rsquo ll be able to hear the audio coaching alert telling the driver to buckle up . Plus, you rsquo ll have enough footage available to see if the driver actually does. Alex Amort, VP of Compliance at Cascade Environmental , found many new opportunities for fleet improvement after installing Motive rsquo s dash cams. ldquo I quickly learned that you can rsquo t fix what you don rsquo t see, rdquo he said. With Motive rsquo s Smart Dashcam detecting high-risk behaviors, and Motive rsquo s proprietary, predictive DRIVE risk model objectively identifying higher risk drivers, the field services contractor was able to target its coaching efforts and help make drivers safer. Improved driver behavior A shorter video may not provide sufficient evidence to convince a driver to change their behaviors. The longer videos give you the data you need to identify patterns in driver behavior, such as speeding or aggressive driving. nbsp Kentuckiana Trucking rsquo s Dispatcher Driver Safety Manager Wayne Milby credited AI Dashcams with a 30 to 40 drop in accidents in an interview with Fleet News Daily . He also said, ldquo The AI Dashcam has inspired one of our most aggressive drivers to completely change his style of driving. When we first implemented dash cams, the driver rsquo s habits triggered four or five unsafe driving alerts a day. Now, that driver may get one alert every few weeks. It rsquo s been an amazing improvement. rdquo The information gained from analysis of longer videos can also help you target driver training to particular fleet behaviors, or individual driver habits, to improve behavior and reduce the risk of accidents. nbsp Longer dash cam videos can be used to promote self-awareness among drivers. By reviewing their own footage , drivers can see how they are performing and identify areas where they may need to improve. This can help drivers become more aware of distracted driving and other unsafe behaviors and take more responsibility. Other factors to consider in fleet dash cam video The popularity of fleet dash cams has grown, driven in part by the increasing availability of affordable, high-quality cameras. As more companies adopt the technology and see the benefits of this vehicle safety technology , it s likely that dash cams will become even more common in fleets of all types and sizes. nbsp Fleet managers and operators have many options to select from. Today s fleet dash cams are often equipped with features like GPS tracking, motion detection, and live streaming capabilities, making them even more valuable tools. They can also provide real-time updates on driver behavior, vehicle location, even weather conditions, allowing fleet managers to make more informed decisions about operations. Research video quality and storage capacity when choosing the best dash cam for your unique business needs. You rsquo ll want to clearly see what is happening on the road or in the driver rsquo s cab. Truck dash cams with a wide dynamic range WDR and wide-angle lens offering HD resolutions can help you see more important details. Plus, you rsquo ll want to investigate how the dash cam footage is stored and for how long. Typically, you rsquo ll be choosing between cloud storage and memory card or micro SD card . Cloud storage can generally hold a higher volume of footage than memory cards. Ease of installation and use are also important factors. You can configure an internet-connected truck dash cam to back up on a consistent schedule. But it rsquo s useful also to make it easy for drivers to send important videos when needed. Read Introducing the AI camera that will help you see more . Integrating your dash cam with fleet management software Effectively integrating dash cam video with your fleet management solution can enable you to streamline operations and track and manage your fleet in a single platform. Accessing dash cam footage, driver data, and vehicle performance information all in one place, can improve your efficiency and save you time and money while also improving overall fleet performance.

            "Fleet maintenance helps keep vehicles in good condition to maximize their reliability, safety, and lifespan. With maintenance best practices, fleet operators can reduce downtime, minimize repair costs, and ensure road safety. Effective fleet maintenance also supports compliance, improves driver retention, and can have significant financial benefits over the long term. nbsp This article outlines best practices in general fleet maintenance before taking a closer look at how to best maintain and service fleets in specific industries. Develop a fleet maintenance schedule Keeping a regular maintenance schedule can prevent unexpected vehicle breakdowns and avoid major repairs that lead to costly downtime. When you develop a schedule for maintenance, you can also identify potential safety hazards in advance, such as worn-out brakes or tires, and prevent accidents on the road. nbsp Maintenance scheduling also helps extend the lifespan of your vehicles and can save your business money in the long run by getting the most out of your asset investment. You rsquo ll also see sustainability gains as a properly maintained fleet is more fuel-efficient and reliable, which can lead to significant cost savings for the business. Simplify fleet maintenance with Motive. Create a maintenance schedule Creating a maintenance schedule for fleets requires careful planning and ongoing monitoring to ensure that vehicles are well-maintained and running smoothly. Maintenance scheduling involves several steps Evaluate fleet vehicles to determine their individual maintenance needs. Consider factors such as age, mileage, usage patterns, and manufacturer recommendations. Identify the maintenance tasks that each vehicle requires, including preventive maintenance, inspections, and repairs. Consider tasks such as oil changes, brake inspections, tire rotations, and fluid checks. Develop a maintenance schedule that outlines when each vehicle requires maintenance tasks. This can be based on a combination of time, mileage, or usage metrics. Using fleet management software or other technology tools can help you manage the maintenance schedule and track performance metrics. This provides valuable insights into fleet performance to help identify areas for improvement. Determine who will be responsible for carrying out the maintenance tasks, whether it s an in-house maintenance team or an outsourced provider. Assign specific tasks and timelines to ensure accountability and track progress. Monitor the effectiveness of the maintenance schedule and make adjustments as needed. This may involve tweaking the schedule to better align with actual usage patterns or modifying maintenance tasks based on performance data. Scheduling factors to consider nbsp When building out your fleet maintenance schedule, there are several factors to consider. These include nbsp Vehicle age. Older vehicles generally require more frequent maintenance as wear and tear can take a toll on various parts and components. Vehicle usage. Vehicles that are driven more frequently, carry heavier loads, or operate in harsher conditions may require more frequent maintenance. Manufacturer recommendations. These account for the vehicle s specific design and intended usage. Regulatory requirements. Depending on the industry and location, there may be regulatory requirements for vehicle maintenance. Seasonal changes. Weather and temperature impact the maintenance needs of vehicles. Performance metrics . Use performance data to inform maintenance scheduling decisions. Data on vehicle breakdowns, fuel consumption, and maintenance costs can provide insights into when and how often maintenance tasks should be performed. Budget. Consider the available budget and prioritize essential maintenance tasks and ensure that the budget can accommodate the necessary repairs and replacements. Conduct regular inspections Fleets should schedule regular inspections to ensure that their vehicles are operating safely, reliably, and efficiently. These inspections can help identify issues before they become more serious and costly. nbsp Inspections help ensure regulatory compliance as well. It rsquo s important for fleet operators to know the industry- and jurisdiction-specific safety regulations that require regular inspections and maintenance. nbsp Regular inspections optimize vehicle performance and improve fuel efficiency, which can save you money and reduce environmental impact . At the same time, you can cut your liability risks. By prioritizing safety through regular inspections and maintenance, fleets can reduce the risk of accidents and associated liability claims. Types of inspections to conduct Fleets should conduct various types of inspections to keep vehicles in optimal condition. Vehicle type, the industry, and regulatory requirements will play a role in your inspection schedule, but typically fleet operators consider the following Drivers should conduct pre-trip inspections before operating the vehicle each day. A pre-trip inspection typically involves checking basic safety features such as brakes, lights, tires, and fluid levels. Regular maintenance inspections should be conducted on a schedule, which may be based on mileage, time, or usage. These inspections typically involve checking various systems such as brakes, suspension, steering, tires, and fluids. Depending on the industry and location, fleets may be subject to Department of Transportation DOT inspections which typically involve a more comprehensive inspection of the vehicle, including the engine, transmission, and exhaust systems. In some areas, fleets may also be required to undergo an annual inspection to ensure regulatory compliance. If a vehicle is involved in an accident, conduct a post-accident inspection to assess the damage and identify any issues that may have contributed to the accident. Fleets may need to conduct specialized inspections as well. For example, a fleet that operates hazardous materials vehicles may need to conduct specialized inspections to ensure that the vehicles are properly equipped and maintained Frequency of inspections Prioritize regular inspections to ensure fleet vehicles are in optimal working condition. Operators should consult regulatory requirements, manufacturer recommendations, and industry best practices to determine the appropriate frequency of inspections for their specific needs. nbsp You rsquo ll want to track your inspections with driver vehicle inspection records DVIRs . Whether you complete a DVIR on paper or electronically, nbsp electronic DVIRs eDVIRs nbsp make the process more efficient. Especially if you rsquo re using an nbsp electronic logging device ELD nbsp with vehicle inspection functionalities. Keep maintenance records on fleet vehicles Fleet maintenance records are essential for the effective management of a fleet. Your records provide a comprehensive history of vehicle maintenance and repairs, which can be used to track maintenance costs, identify trends, and make informed decisions about future maintenance needs. nbsp Further, keeping accurate maintenance records can help ensure compliance with regulatory requirements . Many fleets must meet specific requirements for maintaining maintenance records. Failure to comply can result in penalties and fines. Your maintenance records can also help support warranty claims, and maintain the resale value of the vehicle. They could prove useful as well in the event of an accident. Having a comprehensive maintenance history available can demonstrate that the fleet took reasonable steps to maintain the vehicle and ensure its safety. Types of records to keep Fleets have many types of maintenance records to track for effective management of their vehicles. By prioritizing record-keeping and maintaining accurate and up-to-date records, fleets can improve compliance, reduce costs, and mitigate liability risks. Common types of maintenance records operators retain include Vehicle information. Basic information about the vehicle, such as the make, model, and VIN number can be used to identify the vehicle and ensure maintenance records are associated with the correct vehicle. Maintenance and repair history. A comprehensive record of all maintenance and repairs performed on the vehicle includes the date, type of service, parts used, and cost of the service. Preventive maintenance schedules. This records preventive services such as oil changes, tire rotations, and brake inspections and the mileage or time interval for each service, and the date and cost of each service performed. Inspection reports. Retain reports from any inspections performed on the vehicle, such as DOT inspections, annual inspections, and pre-trip inspections. These reports should include any defects or violations found during the inspection and the actions taken to correct them. Warranty claims. If you submit a warranty claim for the vehicle, keep a record including the date of the claim, the type of claim, and any documentation required to support the claim. Fuel and usage records. Tracking and recording fuel purchases and vehicle usage, such as mileage or hours of operation, can help fleet managers gauge fuel efficiency and identify opportunities to reduce fuel costs. Implement preventive maintenance Preventive maintenance refers to the proactive, periodic, and routine upkeep of vehicles, equipment, and other business assets. Fleet managers perform preventive maintenance while their vehicles and assets still function well. The purpose is to keep assets in optimal condition, maximize availability, and prevent sudden, expensive malfunctions and subsequent downtimes. Running an effective preventive maintenance program in fleet management offers several benefits including improved vehicle reliability for maximized availability. This supports improved fleet productivity. nbsp Further, you can uncover issues before they become serious concerns requiring larger-scale repairs. This can lengthen vehicle life span and lower your total cost of ownership, which directly impacts a business rsquo s bottom line. Plus, your drivers can feel more confident on the road. With an ongoing truck driver shortage, anything you can do to help retention and recruitment has a real, positive impact. Typical preventive maintenance activities nbsp Preventive maintenance activities will vary for every vehicle classification. Some may require more regular fluid or parts replacements while others may need more rigorous compliance inspections. Still, some common examples of preventive maintenance include Oil changes Tire rotations Brake inspections nbsp Electrical system component checks Cooling and fuel system inspections Filling, changing, and repairing fluids Transmission and engine mount assessments Suspension and steering system evaluations Use fleet maintenance software Fleet maintenance software streamlines all these best practices making it simpler for you to develop your schedules, track inspections, keep accurate records, and plan preventive maintenance. Providing fleet maintenance managers with software to automate manual processes such as scheduling maintenance, tracking fuel usage, and managing driver logs can reduce administrative overhead and increase operational efficiency. With the technology enhancing insights into fuel consumption and vehicle downtime, optimizing maintenance schedules to take a proactive approach gets easier too. nbsp No longer having to rely entirely on manual processes, written driver logs, and files crammed with paper documentation, you gain real-time visibility into vehicle status and usage. This clear understanding of fleet operations supports informed decisions, ensures regulatory compliance, and improves overall fleet performance. Integrations for fleet maintenance software Fleet operators can get even more value from their fleet maintenance software by integrating it with a fleet management solution. Look for an integrated solution that empowers users with features such as Real-time GPS tracking with location history to help fleet managers nbsp analyze routes , cut paperwork and administrative burden, and increase efficiency.

Driver risk scoring and benchmarking to help you easily nbsp identify at-risk drivers, better target nbsp driver coaching nbsp programs, and track improvements among drivers over time. nbsp Industry-specific fleet maintenance practices Fleet maintenance means different things across various industries. The above best practices still apply. Yet, successful fleet managers recognize the individual needs of their business area when working to maintain and service their physical assets. Oil and Gas nbsp The oil and gas industry presents unique challenges due to the harsh environment, rugged terrain, and heavy equipment used. Yet fleet maintenance is particularly important to smooth and safe operations. nbsp Regularly inspect vehicles, heavy equipment , and specialized tools used in drilling, extraction, and transportation. Schedule checks for tire wear, brake performance, and engine oil levels, among other things. Your preventive maintenance activities should include routine fluid changes, filter replacements, and component lubrication to prevent equipment breakdowns. These can help you to minimize equipment downtime and avoid costly repairs. It rsquo s also important to maintain safety equipment such as fire extinguishers, first aid kits, and personal protective equipment. You rsquo ll want to ensure fleet vehicles are equipped with spill-prevention and response equipment as well. Fleet management best practices can also help ensure compliance with the numerous safety and environmental regulations for the oil and gas industry, such as complying with hours-of-service HOS rules and ensuring proper disposal of hazardous materials. nbsp Construction Maintaining vehicles and equipment is critical for successful construction project completion.

            "When a Norfolk Southern train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, 11 of the 38 train cars that derailed carried toxic chemicals, threatening the town rsquo s air, soil, and water. Later, the chemicals were set ablaze in a controlled burn that sent black smoke billowing toward the sky and residents fleeing. The incident, one of two derailments involving the railroad in a single month, set off a firestorm of debate about the impacts of precision-scheduled railroading PSR and a push for freight efficiency that some say compromises safety . nbsp Transportation companies don rsquo t have to choose between efficiency and safety. With the help of safety technology, they can maximize both. nbsp In this story, we explore important lessons from the Norfolk Southern derailment and show how technology brings safety and efficiency together. To provide insight, we turned to two former safety execs mdash Don Osterberg formerly of Schneider and Sam Faucette formerly of Old Dominion . nbsp Download our Ultimate Guide to fleet safety today. What is precision-scheduled railroading? The Class 1 railroads introduced PSR as a strategy to drive efficiency and reduce costs. Under the program, railroads use fewer and longer trains, with fewer terminals and operators. The trains operate on fixed schedules for more consistent service . But the system carries risks. In the PSR model, the railroads increased train length to maximize capacity. The Norfolk Southern train, for example, had 151 cars that stretched for nearly two miles. The added stress on the track and equipment increases the need for maintenance. And because crews must walk the length of the train to identify problems, making repairs mid-route isn rsquo t feasible. We asked Osterberg and Faucette, each with extensive fleet safety experience, to highlight key lessons from the Norfolk Southern derailment. Here are their top takeaways for the trucking industry. 1. To reduce accident severity, reduce accident frequency When the Norfolk Southern derailment occurred on Feb. 3, it wasn rsquo t the first time the train experienced problems on the route . On Feb. 1, after originating in Madison, Illinois, the train broke down at least once before derailing two days later. For commercial fleets, it rsquo s a cautionary tale. ldquo The more frequency you have, the larger your chances of a severe accident, rdquo says Faucette. ldquo To improve fleet safety, you have to control accident frequency and severity over time. The key is to use safety technology to drive down frequencies as much as possible. And to keep driving them down. rdquo nbsp AI dash cams, for example, proactively reduce the frequency and severity of unsafe driving behaviors on the road. Fifty-four percent of dash cam customers surveyed said they rsquo ve used dash cams to reduce cell phone use, close following, and other unsafe driving behaviors. Another 43 of respondents said dash cams have helped to reduce the frequency of accidents. As unsafe incidents become more frequent , the level of risk rises. Not only because frequency can lead to severity. But because operators become desensitized to potential dangers. ldquo When fleets and operators cut corners without a negative outcome, they don rsquo t believe anything bad will happen to them, rdquo says Osterberg. ldquo The reality is that cutting corners works great mdash nbsp until it doesn rsquo t work. And when it doesn rsquo t work, we have tragedies like derailments and truck crashes. rdquo nbsp 2. Safety technology prevents accidents, improves efficiency With tragedies and crashes come injuries, lawsuits, repair costs, high insurance premiums , and downtime. The takeaway? Safe performance isn rsquo t only profitable, it rsquo s productive. Accident prevention keeps your fleet moving and your people healthy. nbsp Artificial intelligence AI , computer vision, and automation are exactly the sorts of tools that reduce risk and keep brand names out of the headlines. Businesses can leverage AI to prevent close following, unsafe lane changes, and distracted driving in real time. Out on the road, dangers come on quickly. Through AI and automation, operators can take corrective action just as fast. ldquo In-cab alerts and dual-facing AI dash cams are pivotal to rooting out unsafe driving behaviors and preventing accidents, rdquo Osterberg says. ldquo And while some drivers push back against dual-facing dash cams, the safety insights that dash cams provide are so valuable, it rsquo s worth it for fleets to work through any resistance they may get to enjoy their benefits. rdquo nbsp Unsafe driving habits like speeding, hard braking, and hard acceleration also happen to be big fuel guzzlers. Speeding alone hurts a fleet rsquo s bottom line by running up fuel costs and requiring more maintenance. Fleets can improve fuel efficiency and cut costs by reducing unsafe driving habits and their impact. Use GPS to plan more direct routes. Rely on fuel insights to improve fuel economy and reduce fuel spending. 3. Coach drivers to root out unsafe behaviors While the NTSB rsquo s preliminary report didn rsquo t indicate human error as a factor in the East Palestine derailment, it rsquo s been said that human error causes between 80 and 90 of serious injuries and accidents . nbsp In light of these statistics, the ability to change human behavior before unsafe habits have time to take root is crucial. Fleet safety technology alone can rsquo t change human behavior. But frequent coaching can. Automated and in-person coaching tools like those from Motive allow drivers to grow and improve in different ways. nbsp By accessing self-coaching tips through modern driver apps, operators can improve independently, without manager intervention. When incidents continue to occur, managers can reinforce safety expectations during an in-person coaching session. nbsp 4. Fleets can invest in accident prevention mdash or settle claims With nuclear verdicts commonplace today in trucking, commercial fleets have become financial targets. It rsquo s an unsettling thought when you stop to consider the crippling monetary impacts large verdicts and settlements have. In 2021, a Florida jury awarded a landmark 1 billion verdict in a wrongful death case involving two trucking fleets. That rsquo s not the norm. But even smaller verdicts can be costly. The mean payment size of smaller verdicts and settlements hovers around 427,000 . ldquo When you recognize that the cost side of awards is going up exponentially, most fleets will be surprised to see that they rsquo re under-investing in prevention and overpaying for failures, rdquo Osterberg says. ldquo Ask yourself which preventive technologies make sense to implement and err on the side of action. rdquo 5. Safety must be a profit center, not a cost center Fleets of all sizes and across industries believe safety is a priority. But how many of them have made safety a core value? As Osterberg notes, ldquo priorities change, values rarely do. rdquo nbsp While some managers realize that investing in a strong safety program will unlock revenue opportunities and cut expenses, too many fleets view safety programs as costly ldquo nice-to-haves. rdquo nbsp ldquo The fleet operation itself has to be a profit center, rdquo Faucette says. ldquo If it s not profitable, the company won t be in business long. A successful transportation operation focuses on safety and efficiency at every department level. That rsquo s true whether it s maintenance, purchasing, hiring, or training. rdquo nbsp Profit generation comes from the hundreds of small decisions a company makes as it progresses and grows, Faucette adds. ldquo The wise decisions will have their effect, and the costly decisions will have their effect. If not today, then sometime in the future. rdquo Unlock the power of safety technology Don rsquo t wait for a tragedy to impact your fleet.

            "National Safety Council statistician Ken Kolosh explains what s behind an uptick in work-related incidents and how to prevent them. As summer heats up, the National Safety Council is drawing attention to the fact that preventable injuries are the fourth leading cause of U.S. deaths . Every industry works to improve safety. Recently though, more workers are dying on the job than before the COVID-19 pandemic began. In fact, the risk of death to workers is higher now than at any time since 2016. In 2021, the National Safety Council NSC tracked 5,190 fatal work injuries , an 8.9 increase over 2020. nbsp Two industries consistently account for the most worker deaths construction and transportation warehousing. The NSC reports that the construction industry experienced the most deaths in 2021, while transportation had the highest rates of injury and illness that involved days away from work. nbsp So why do the construction and transportation industries struggle to keep their fleet drivers and workers safe? We recently spoke with Ken Kolosh, statistician for the NSC. He explained, In general, our roads have been less safe since the pandemic, largely due to changing behaviors. nbsp With fewer cars on the road in the early days of the pandemic, drivers were more likely to speed or engage in risky behaviors. The National Highway Traffic Administration reported that crash deaths increased in 2020 despite a huge drop in the number of miles driven, with more deaths resulting from speeding, unbelted passengers, and high blood-alcohol concentrations. nbsp Even as stay-at-home orders ended and more drivers returned to the roads, these bad behaviors had become ingrained habits. Today, speeding is a factor in more than one in four traffic fatalities . nbsp As heavy users of public roads, construction and transportation workers are at greater risk of incidents. However, fleet managers can take important steps to increase the safety of their drivers and the general public. These four proactive changes can make the roads safer for everyone. nbsp 1. Use AI to identify the hazards Kolosh says that fleets can start improving driver safety by working to better understand which specific hazards their drivers face. We have to do a better job of identifying and resolving hazards before a worker dies, he says. The first step is the collection of data in order to identify those hazards before the worst happens. All organizations have to systematically make sure they re collecting the right data. Today s AI-powered fleet management solutions can help fleets collect this data to understand trends and opportunities for improvement. For example, Motive AI Dashcams can identify driver behaviors like speeding, following too closely, or seatbelt usage. These hazards can then be scored and ranked in a dashboard , helping a fleet manager quickly prioritize the most dangerous or prevalent behaviors. nbsp Such data are especially useful in industries like construction and transportation , where a fleet s drivers may be working solo, far from headquarters. nbsp Kolosh notes, The best way to keep workers safe is not by wearing PPE. It s by eliminating the hazards in the first place. Collecting and understanding data on incidents of all types enables fleet managers to identify new ways to reduce their risks. nbsp 2. Involve everyone in your fleet Fleet and driver safety doesn t improve by simply identifying hazards. Rather, Kolosh says, It s about taking proactive, preventative measures instead of reactive measures. And those proactive measures only succeed when drivers take part in the conversation. Every employee owns safety not just managers, Kolosh says. Getting everyone involved is really where it works best. Fleet managers can take the data they ve collected and prioritized, then use it to actively coach drivers to improve behaviors . Using footage from the Motive AI Dashcam , fleet managers can show drivers exactly how close they came to a crash or how their quick defensive driving prevented a crash. That same footage can also exonerate a driver from a false accusation. Coaching should be part of a larger, comprehensive driver safety program that involves the entire organization , Kolosh says. Workers need to be more involved in the solution. There s a critical component in a systematic safety program where they should be involved in reporting hazards and do hazard walk-arounds to identify environments and potential opportunities that could lead to an incident. That could mean toolbox talks or other types of team meetings where drivers learn from each other. And coaching shouldn t be a one-and-done occurrence. Rather, drivers should regularly receive coaching in various forms, from one-on-one sessions to reviewing their own dash cam videos. Ongoing reinforcement is the best way to foster lasting change. nbsp 3. Empower drivers to be safer As part of ongoing coaching, drivers should feel empowered to do their work as safely as possible. Help drivers connect the dots between their actions and their safety by sharing fleetwide data, celebrating safety improvements, and encouraging drivers to learn from each other. nbsp Don t let drivers despair about the growing risks on the roads. Rather, help them see how combining technology and coaching can help them take control of the situation. nbsp Most importantly, Kolosh says, connect your coaching and lessons with workers day-to-day responsibilities, so that when they get back on the jobsite, they know what to do in order to bend the curve and prevent workplace fatalities. Depending on the size of your fleet, you can try several things to track driver safety improvements, such as Creating a fleet dashboard to show improvements in safety metrics. Recognizing drivers with the safest records and those who improve. Sharing video of drivers whose quick thinking and smart defensive driving averted a crash. Also stress that you have your drivers backs. For example, dash cam footage can help exonerate drivers from false claims which can cut insurance and claims costs while protecting your fleet s reputation. nbsp 4. Stress the less tangible benefits of safety Improving your safety record not only saves lives and prevents injuries, but it can also improve fleet profitability. Kolosh says, Improving safety often improves productivity, quality, and the bottom line. It s not just about keeping employees safe it s good business. nbsp Make sure your drivers make this connection. After all, a safer fleet is a more successful fleet one that can improve job security and satisfaction. nbsp The National Safety Council has an important mission The National Safety Council highlights the leading causes of preventable injury and death so people can live their fullest lives. Visit nsc.org nsm to learn how to keep your workers safe in the summer and all year-round.

Focus on driver training programs Driver training plays a crucial role in promoting safety , reducing accidents, improving fuel efficiency, and enhancing overall fleet performance. nbsp Creating effective driver training and coaching programs helps instill safe driving behaviors and practices by equipping fleet drivers with the necessary skills and knowledge to navigate various road conditions, handle emergencies, and follow traffic laws. nbsp Well-trained drivers are more aware of potential hazards and less prone to accidents. Ensuring fleet drivers are aware of and comply with safety standards mitigates the risk of fines, penalties, and potential legal liabilities as well. Further, using driver training to promote a safety culture can lead to lower insurance costs, reduced vehicle downtime, and improved overall fleet safety. Simultaneously, driver training programs often focus on avoiding aggressive acceleration and hard braking, maintaining optimal speeds, and minimizing idle time. All these contribute to fuel-efficiency, which can reduce fleet fuel and vehicle maintenance costs while also lowering carbon emissions. Supporting driver training program success To ensure the success of a driver training program, efforts should first focus on a fleet s needs, industry, and operational challenges. Fleet managers might use telematics data to hone in on vehicle type, driving conditions, route, or other unique factors to customize training to effectively address specific skills and knowledge drivers need. nbsp Make training ongoing to help drivers stay current and continuously improve. Fleets with driver scoring systems could incentivize safer driving by rewarding those who consistently demonstrate safe driving practices and achieve fuel efficiency targets. The scoring can also help fleet managers identify drivers who would benefit from additional coaching. Offering after-trip coaching tailored to a particular driving behavior can also engage drivers and enhance learning retention. Dash cams can provide another layer of safety, and support more effective driver coaching programs. Using a clip of a critical safety event such as hard braking, hard cornering, or excessive acceleration can speak specifically to what that individual driver was doing and how to counter driving risky behaviors. 3. Prioritize route optimization Creating the most efficient routes can be challenging for the human fleet manager. Yet, route optimization software can efficiently and accurately consider multiple factors such as traffic conditions, vehicle capacities, delivery pickup time windows, and driver availability. nbsp Optimized routes reduce unnecessary mileage, minimize idle time, and improve overall fleet productivity. This can result in fuel consumption cuts, lower vehicle wear and tear, and reduced labor costs. These reductions also contribute to environmental sustainability by lowering the fleet s carbon footprint. Eliminating unnecessary detours, optimizing delivery sequences, and minimizing empty miles, can also net significant cost savings in fuel expenses , maintenance, and driver overtime. nbsp At the same time, customer satisfaction grows with improved, on-time performance. Reliability builds stronger customer relationships. Advanced route optimization software often incorporates real-time data and dynamic routing capabilities. This enables fleets to adapt quickly to unexpected changes, such as traffic congestion, road closures, or last-minute customer requests improving overall fleet responsiveness. Choosing your route optimization software The right route optimization software can streamline operations, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. When selecting a route optimization solution, look for the following Features such as address geocoding, multi-stop optimization, real-time traffic updates, and route customization Integration with other fleet management systems Ability to handle the size and complexity of your fleet operations Flexibility to accommodate various fleet types and industries Intuitive and user-friendly interface Analytical capabilities and reporting functionalities nbsp Data visualization tools Quality customer service 4. Track KPIs Key performance indicators KPIs can play a crucial role by providing measurable metrics to assess and track the performance of your fleet. Every fleet will track its own individual key KPIs to gauge fleet efficiency. Yet the following are four common fleet management metrics. nbsp Fuel Efficiency Metrics a fleet manager might track to better understand and improve fleet fuel efficiency include Fuel consumption per mile kilometer. Measuring the amount of fuel consumed by a vehicle for a given distance traveled helps track and compare fuel efficiency across a fleet and pinpoint opportunities for improvement. Miles kilometers per gallon. Calculating the distance a vehicle can travel on one gallon or liter of fuel allows managers to assess and compare different vehicles or drivers to optimize routes, and identify fuel-wasting behaviors. Idling time. Tracking the percentage of time a vehicle spends idling can significantly impact fuel consumption. nbsp Vehicle Downtime By monitoring and analyzing vehicle downtime KPIs, fleet managers can identify areas for improvement, optimize maintenance processes, implement proactive measures, and ultimately reduce vehicle downtime. Regularly reviewing the following metrics may minimize operational disruptions Vehicle use. Measuring the percentage of time a vehicle is actively used helps identify underutilized vehicles or potential overcapacity situations. This KPI can help to optimize fleet size, reduce downtime, and improve operational efficiency. Average vehicle downtime. Calculating the average time a vehicle spends off-road or out of service helps identify maintenance issues, improve maintenance planning, and minimize disruptions. Planned maintenance compliance.

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the June 2023 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the June edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report, where we analyze the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform during the past month. Keep reading for a front-seat view into the key factors influencing the U.S. economy. Big Picture May saw no reprieve from the freight recession with slumps in Memorial Day Weekend demand Registrations of new carriers dipped to their lowest levels since June 2020, while carrier exits maintained April levels. The top 50 retailers did not increase inventories to support Memorial Day Weekend sales, though ldquo peak season rdquo around July 4 will be a better indicator. Despite the ongoing rebalancing, labor disputes on the West Coast bring the threat of renewed supply chain disruptions. Carrier registrations and exits indicate the freight recession charges on The slowing of carrier exits expected in Q2 has not yet materialized, as May saw 3,500 carriers exit the market, similar to levels seen in April. Meanwhile, there were less than 7,200 new carrier registrations last month. This represents a 22 month-over-month decrease that matches levels last seen in June of 2020, before the pandemic freight explosion. Regionally, the sharpest declines in carrier starts were once again seen in Southern states down 31 since April 2022 . These are being driven by Texas and Florida, which represent 40 of the new company starts. The freight market rsquo s rebalancing continues Motive rsquo s Retail Freight Index now includes the top 50 retailers by revenue Retailers showed little appetite to increase inventories for the summer, and Memorial Day didn rsquo t see its typical acceleration of traffic in the 2 weeks leading up to the holiday. Memorial Day brought no significant increase in traffic to distribution centers for the top 50 retailers by volume, and retailers in all regions saw lower traffic compared to 2022. nbsp For the moment we have seen no change in sentiment from retailers wanting to increase inventory levels. nbsp As in April, the Midwest saw the smallest year-over-year dip in traffic 12 . The July 4th holiday is typically the stronger indicator of inventory strategies for the holiday season, but the May data nonetheless paints a negative picture for freight demand through the first five months of the year. West Coast port negotiations could spell another supply chain crunch despite demand trends Recent data of daily truck visits at the Port of Oakland offer a look at what labor disputes on the West Coast could herald. The port saw sharp drops in visits on Friday, June 2 in line with breakdowns in negotiations and Tuesday, June 6, while Monday, June 5 saw the median wait time for a vehicle at the port rise 30 from a typical Monday. Coupled with an increasing number of ships heading for the West Coast, these occurrences could circumvent current demand trends to create a supply chain crunch. Key takeaway nbsp It is paramount that carriers plan for scenarios that buck traditional norms such as seasonal bumps in freight demand and maintain operational efficiency. Flexibility in both nationwide and local planning can help them weather a freight recession that hasn rsquo t yet shown signs of slowing down. A comprehensive understanding of current trends at various parts of the supply chain is also critical to avoid being caught flat-footed. Data Methodology The Motive Monthly Economic Report uses aggregated and anonymized insights from the Motive network, as well as publicly available government data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and U.S. Department of Transportation.\n",

            "A Driver Vehicle Inspection Report, or DVIR, confirms drivers have inspected their commercial motor vehicles before heading out on the road and again at the end of the day. The federal government requires drivers to formally record these pre- and post-trip inspections to help ensure that vehicle issues are identified and addressed. Completing DVIRs is vital for safety and compliance. Having an inspection process can also add fleet savings. nbsp nbsp What you need to know about DVIRs Commercial motor vehicle CMV drivers are federally mandated to document their pre- and post-trip vehicle checks on a DVIR form. The requirements vary for the type of inspection, yet the overarching goal is to identify and record any vehicle defects. The process supports safety for drivers, their vehicles, and others on the road. Legal requirements and regulations nbsp The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA , under the Department of Transportation DoT regulates pre-trip, post-trip, and periodic inspections. Fleet drivers need to know the requirements for each type of vehicle inspection. Discover more compliance solutions with Motive. Pre-trip inspection The FMCSA rsquo s nbsp Federal Law 49 CFR 396.13 nbsp requires pre-trip examinations. Drivers must thoroughly examine the commercial vehicle rsquo s components and systems before every trip. Checking the fuel tank, vehicle lights, tires, and other essentials before a daily haul helps ensure that the vehicle is safe to drive and in good condition. Drivers taking multi-day trips would perform a pre-trip inspection every day to remain road safe and compliant. Non-compliance with the Department of Transport DoT pre-trip inspection requirements can mean hefty fines and lead to certification and license loss. Post-trip inspection FMCSA Federal Law 49 CFR 396.11 requires drivers to perform a post-trip inspection of commercial vehicles at the end of the workday. Drivers operating more than one vehicle must complete separate DVIRs for each CMV. The post-trip inspection is an opportunity to identify vehicle defects that may have occurred during a trip. Any issues or defects found get reported to the fleet manager or motor carrier to ensure necessary repairs are made before the vehicle is put in service again. This helps minimize future delays that could seriously impact delivery times and operations. These reports can also help fleet managers better understand vehicle health and how different drivers operate their vehicles. Motor carriers must also maintain the original DVIR, certification of repairs, and certification of the driver rsquo s review for three months from the date of the initial report. Periodic inspection All CMVs must also undergo periodic inspection at least once in a 12-month period, per FMCSA Federal Law 49 CFR 396.17, 396.21 . Motor carriers must also retain the periodic inspection report for 14 months while keeping documentation of the most recent periodic inspection sticker, report, or decal on the vehicle. nbsp Types of DVIRs Drivers can complete DVIRs manually or electronically. Filling out a DVIR form manually, however, may be more time-consuming. Writing on paper can also require drivers to capture a lot of information in small spaces, which can undermine legibility. Additionally, drivers need to keep track of that paperwork and turn it in. Fleet managers must also monitor, manage, and store many different drivers rsquo paper forms with many inspections done per day . nbsp Electronic DVIRs, or eDVIRs nbsp make the process more efficient. Drivers can simply log into an app, enter their vehicle trailer details, select defects from a list, and sign. It rsquo s even easier if you rsquo re using an nbsp electronic logging device ELD nbsp with vehicle inspection functionalities. Note The nbsp DVIR regulation exempts driveaway-towaway, motor carriers with only one CMV, and private motor carriers that carry passengers but not as a business. Identifying and documenting vehicle defects Knowing a DVIR rsquo s meaning helps drivers understand that the purpose of these inspections is to identify and report any defects or maintenance issues. The aim is to ensure that vehicles are safe to operate. This makes it critical for drivers to be thorough and observant during their inspections. Looking for signs of wear and tear, leaks, loose or damaged parts, or any other abnormalities that could indicate a problem with the vehicle can protect drivers, assets, and others on the road. nbsp Pay attention to both the exterior and interior of the vehicle. Document any defects or issues found. This typically involves noting the nature of the defect, its location on the vehicle, and any additional details that may be relevant. Using clear and specific language to describe the problem, and including a rating of the severity, can help fleet managers make decisions about next steps. nbsp Now that we rsquo ve discussed what a DVIR is, the basic legal requirements for the types of inspections, and identifying and documenting vehicle defects, let rsquo s discuss the benefits of instilling basic inspection processes. Benefits of DVIRs DVIRs offer several advantages in addition to enhancing safety on the roads. The required periodic, pre- and post-trip inspections simplify early detection and prevention of issues. With drivers documenting any concerns at the end of the day, perhaps even photographing concerns, it rsquo s easier to maintain vehicles before heavy-duty repairs are needed. This is often referred to as preventive maintenance. Preventive maintenance can offer cost savings by Reducing unexpected downtime Optimizing vehicle performance Extending asset lifespan Maximizing productivity Avoiding large-scale repairs At the same time, with a vehicle inspection process in place, fleets can avoid costly compliance issues. Violations of DVIR regulations could lead to penalties such as 1,270 a day for failing to complete a DVIR Up to 12,695 for knowingly falsifying, destroying, or changing DVIR records Up to 15,419 for each non-recordkeeping violation Completing inspections for DVIRs makes fleet vehicles more likely to pass any roadside inspections. Otherwise, if a vehicle is deemed unsafe, the truck will be put out of commission for repairs. That can mean downtime, which affects revenue, and lower CSA scores, which can cause a loss of business. 4 DVIR best practices Along with following fleet management best practices , it is helpful to also focus specifically on inspection strategies for success. These four best practices can support safety, savings, and compliance. nbsp 1. Establish a standardized process Ensure that drivers can complete a DVIR following a consistent process Inspect vehicle interior and exterior, thoroughly. After completing the inspection, document any defects or issues. nbsp Follow the reporting process. This may mean labeling the severity of defects or issues and notifying a supervisor of severe issues. Or the inspection report might go to a specific department if there are no repairs to initiate after that inspection. Take corrective action. If defects are reported, appropriate action must be taken to address them promptly. This may involve scheduling repairs, replacing faulty parts, or conducting further investigations to determine the root cause of the defect. These are the basic steps in a DVIR process , but each fleet may want to customize its vehicle inspection form to address specific business needs. nbsp 2. Train drivers on procedures and expectations When onboarding drivers, make sure that training addresses what needs to be inspected before and after each trip. Also, educate your drivers about the DVIR process and its importance. Emphasizing the safety benefits as well as productivity gains can help motivate drivers to be thorough and observant. nbsp Plan to go over how to complete a DVIR form, whether manually or electronically, and what happens next as far as submitting the records. Remind drivers that retention of records is an essential component of compliance. 3. Use technology for efficient DVIR management Streamline the vehicle inspection process while improving accuracy by using technology to manage reporting. Options include DVIR app. Mobile apps enable drivers to conduct inspections using their smartphones or tablets, eliminating the need for paper forms. They can also capture images, record audio, and input data directly into digital forms, making the process more efficient and reducing the chances of errors. Electronic logging devices ELDs . ELDs connected to the vehicle s engine automatically record data related to the vehicle s operation. Many modern ELD systems let drivers complete and submit DVIRs electronically through the ELD, which simplifies the process and ensures accurate and timely reporting. Fleet management system integration. Integrating a DVIR management system with existing fleet management software enables seamless data transfer and consolidation, allowing for comprehensive reporting and analysis. Leverage the technology to automate reminders and notifications for DVIR completion. Connecting inspection reports to maintenance workflow can also streamline work order generation, repair scheduling, and issue resolution. 4. Review and analyze DVIR data nbsp Keeping records of completed inspection reports, repair orders, and maintenance records is required by law. A fleet could need this documentation for audits or compliance checks. nbsp These records also reflect a history of vehicle maintenance . That means these records can provide valuable data for fleet managers looking to better understand vehicle lifespan or maintenance trends. Analyzing the DVIR data can also help to identify and reward drivers who drive their vehicles more carefully. Electronic DVIR An eDVIR lets drivers record, compile, and store inspection information on electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. The eDVIR data can sync directly to fleet management software nbsp through a mobile application to allow for quick, easy, and secure information transfers among stakeholders such as drivers, fleet managers, and trucking company owners. eDVIRs offer several benefits Save time conducting vehicle inspections Ability to take photos of issues for supervisor review Reduce paperwork and keep reports easy to read Review and update eDVIRs anywhere and in real time Enable a proactive approach to issues or defects identified in vehicle inspections Increase data visibility with efficient, immediate access to all inspection reports in the system Customize and track DVIRs with Motive Drivers can use the nbsp Motive Driver App for Android nbsp or nbsp iPhone iPad nbsp to create electronic DVIRs.

            "If you run a business that relies on a fleet of vehicles, then you re probably familiar with fleet cards. These cards are designed to simplify the process of fueling up and maintaining your fleet, but there s an ugly truth that comes with them. In this article, we ll explore the downside of some fleet cards and how to protect yourself from getting scammed. Introduction Fleet cards are supposed to be a convenient and cost-effective way for businesses to manage their fleet expenses. However, some fleet card providers are not transparent about their fee structures and business practices, which can leave business owners with hefty bills. Here s what you need to know. What are fleet cards? Fleet cards are essentially charge cards that are issued to businesses with fleets of vehicles. These cards are meant to be used for fueling up, maintenance, and other expenses related to running a fleet. Fleet card providers promise to simplify the process of managing fleet expenses by offering features like online account management, transaction tracking, and customized spending controls. Want to learn more about how Motive Card can help you save on fuel, maintenance, and more? Click here to explore our no-hidden-fees fleet card! The ugly truth about some fleet card providers While fleet cards may seem like a great solution on paper, the reality is often far from it. Some fleet card providers engage in shady practices that leave business owners with unexpected charges and fees. Here are some of the most common problems with fleet cards Hidden fees One of the most common ways that fleet card providers make money is through fees, which can be hidden in the fine print. For example, some providers may charge a monthly fee for each card, a fee for using the card at certain gas stations, or a fee for accessing account information online. These fees can add up quickly and leave business owners with a surprise bill at the end of the month. Fraudulent charges Another problem with fleet cards is that they do little to protect holders from fraud. In some cases, fleet card providers may not have proper security measures in place, allowing fraudsters to make unauthorized charges on the card. In other cases, they do not have robust tools to detect when employees use the card for personal purchases or for non-work-related expenses. Poor customer service Many fleet card providers have notoriously poor customer service, making it difficult for business owners to resolve issues or get answers to their questions. This can be especially frustrating when dealing with unexpected charges or fraudulent activity on the card. How to protect yourself If you use fleet cards for your business, it s important to take steps to protect yourself from unexpected fees and fraudulent activity. Here are some tips to keep in mind Read the fine print Before signing up for a fleet card, make sure to read the fine print carefully. Look for any hidden fees or charges that could add up over time. If anything seems unclear, don t hesitate to ask for clarification. Monitor your fleet card account Keep a close eye on your fleet card account and transaction history. Look for any unusual activity or charges that you don t recognize. If you spot anything suspicious, report it to your fleet card provider immediately. Set spending limits Many fleet card providers offer customizable spending controls that allow you to set limits on how much can be spent on each card. Take advantage of this feature to prevent employees from using the card for personal purchases or for non-work-related expenses. Choose a reputable provider Do your research before choosing a fleet card provider. Look for providers with a good reputation, positive customer reviews, and transparent pricing policies. Avoid providers with a history of false advertising or poor customer service. Get started with a reputable fleet card provider Fleet cards can be a great tool for businesses with fleets of vehicles, but they also come with a significant risk of unexpected charges and fraud. By taking the time to choose a reputable fleet card provider , monitor your account closely, and set spending limits, you can protect yourself from these risks and keep your fleet operation running smoothly.

            "Summer might mean vacations, road trips, days at the beach, or just ice cream in the backyard. But summer also brings increased risks bee stings, sunburns mdash and traffic accidents. nbsp nbsp nbsp July and August are the most dangerous months on the road , with extra danger lurking around the Independence Day holiday . That rsquo s because summer brings multiple risk factors more people on the roads, people driving in unfamiliar areas, new teen drivers, severe weather, and road construction. However, you can help keep your fleet rsquo s drivers safe all summer long by building a strong safety culture, educating your drivers on summer hazards, and creating incentives that challenge your fleet to drive more carefully. nbsp Build a year-round safety culture An increased focus on summer safety can pay off year-round in terms of fewer incidents, lower insurance premiums , and a better reputation. The key is to build a strong fleet driver safety program . nbsp Fleet driver safety programs can help your drivers build and reinforce safe habits and behaviors. Safety programs should emphasize how important safety is to the entire company, while providing regular coaching to every driver who should receive it. These efforts should start at the top, with executive support. nbsp Fleet management technology can streamline your coaching efforts by prioritizing the riskiest behaviors and reinforcing lessons throughout the year. For example, AI dash cams can identify problematic behaviors and incidents, while also exonerating drivers in the event of false claims. Get tips to start developing a coaching safety program for your own fleet. Switch to preventive maintenance Avoid roadside breakdowns by staying on top of maintenance needs. Switching to preventive maintenance can help fix problems before they become lost time and roadside frustration. This is especially important during summer, when high heat increases the risk of engine trouble and tire problems. nbsp Simple things like conducting routine oil changes, checking coolant levels, and monitoring tire pressure can reduce your drivers rsquo risk of a surprise. Fleets that shift to preventive maintenance even cut maintenance-related downtime days by about 20 . nbsp Motive can go even farther by monitoring vehicle and asset health to enable predictive maintenance PdM , which uses data science and analytics to forecast when vehicles will need service. This predictive approach keeps your fleet moving while reducing the costs of premature upkeep. nbsp nbsp Pay attention to summer hazards Even if your fleet drivers are working routine routes, the drivers around them may not be. Vacationers or road trippers may be traveling unfamiliar roads or distracted by the kids in the backseat. Newly licensed teen drivers are out of school and on the roads. nbsp Remind your drivers to increase their following distance to allow for sudden lane changes or braking, and pay special attention to hazards that are more prevalent in the summer, including Motorcycles More motorcycles are on the road than ever, with more than 8.6 million on US roads in 2021, double the 2002 count . Bicycles Every year, nearly 1,000 cyclists die and more than 130,000 are injured in crashes on US roads. nbsp Pedestrians Pedestrian traffic deaths increased by 18 between 2019 and 2022 . Farm vehicles Summer is prime season for agricultural vehicles on public roads. While farm vehicles spend less than 5 of their operating time on public roads , they are overrepresented in crash rates ndash and since they are typically wider, slower, and heavier than other vehicles, crashes can be severe. nbsp Plan for work zones Orange cones are much more common in summer, when construction crews are active. Remind your drivers to plan for construction hazards by knowing their routes, budgeting additional time, and staying extra vigilant in work zones. About 30 of all work zone accidents are rear-end collisions , and another third are the result of speeding. During your coaching sessions, remind drivers to obey work zone speed limits and avoid the temptation to slow down to watch crews work. nbsp And remember, construction zone hazards like lane shifts, debris, and overturned barrels are present even when work crews are off the clock. Watch for weather While winter rsquo s ice and snow get all the attention, summer brings its own weather hazards. Strong rainstorms can quickly make roads slick, especially if it rsquo s been a while since the last rain. Hail, lightning, high winds, and other hazards can create dangerous conditions. Notify your drivers of impending severe weather, and consider routing them away if possible. And empower your drivers to make the decision about when it rsquo s too dangerous to drive. Coach drivers to respect their instincts when hazardous weather strikes. Encourage them to pull over in a safe place to let the worst blow over. Encourage friendly competition among drivers Give your drivers an incentive to improve their driving over the summer season. Use the Motive fleet dashboard to track each drivers rsquo overall performance, and reward drivers who have the fewest incidents or show improvement. Gift cards, company gear, or extra paid time off can be inspiring perks. nbsp As part of the competition, share the tips above with your drivers to emphasize summer rsquo s unique hazards. By educating your fleet, you rsquo ll empower them to be proactive mdash while a little friendly competition can provide just the right reward.

            "Many fleets fail to invest in dual-facing dash cams. They rsquo re too afraid of distancing drivers. But in their hesitance, these businesses miss something important the vast safety benefits that dual-facing dash cams provide. What if there were a way for drivers to accept dual-facing dash cameras right out of the gate? Actually, there may be. ldquo Take a more positive approach, rdquo says Dan Murray, Senior VP of the American Transportation Research Institute ATRI . And how can you do that? By following Murray rsquo s advice below. 1. Roll out dash cams gradually For faster acceptance among drivers, don rsquo t install dual-facing dash cams in all your vehicles at once. That won rsquo t go over well with drivers. Instead, be strategic in your approach. nbsp ldquo Start with drivers who are experiencing safety issues, then slowly roll out driver-facing cameras to the larger driver population, rdquo Murray suggests. Reduce accidents with the Motive AI Dashcam ldquo Many drivers will say, lsquo I haven t had a crash in 10 years, rsquo or lsquo I rsquo ve never had a crash, so why should I have a dual-facing camera in my vehicle? rsquo And that s a fair question. rdquo nbsp Starting with underperforming drivers allows you to use video clips to coach drivers to improve . Then you can use early success stories to build acceptance with others. 2. Focus on proactive driver coaching For driver coaching to be effective, it has to be timely. It doesn rsquo t get more timely than real-time alerts. Automated in-cab alerts from the Motive AI Dashcam signal unsafe driving instantly. So drivers can stop unsafe behavior instantly, before it leads to a crash. A proactive approach like this prevents accidents and contains costs. That rsquo s good for businesses and for drivers. nbsp Driver coaching has major benefits, whether you prefer automated or in-person. Motive customers who frequently coach, and who use AI dash cams across their fleet, saw up to 80 fewer accidents than those who don rsquo t. Respondents in the Motive 2023 State of Safety Report said they benefited from coaching as well 56 saw fewer unsafe driving behaviors 53 saw fewer accidents 44 saw insurance savings nbsp People will have you believe that commercial drivers are staunchly opposed to dual-facing dash cams. It rsquo s simply not true. What drivers oppose is a punitive approach. Proactive safety training takes a positive approach, and drivers prefer it. ATRI rsquo s recent study, ldquo Issues and Opportunities with Driver-Facing Cameras , rdquo showed that dash cam acceptance actually grew when they were used to help drivers become more skilled. Current users rate dual-facing dash cams more than twice as high as drivers who rsquo ve never used them. nbsp ldquo Our report showed that using dash cam video for proactive safety training not only had a benefit, but that drivers appreciated when the data was used to make them better drivers, rdquo Murray says. nbsp A recent Motive study of 60 active fleets and 40,000 drivers reinforces these findings. In the study, fleets using dual-facing dash cams retained 2.9 more drivers after 75 weeks than those using road-facing dash cams. Here rsquo s what Motive drivers have to say about dual-facing dash cams, in their own words. 3. When drivers show improvement, reward them for it For drivers to embrace dual-facing dash cams, companies have to start using dash cameras more positively. The safest fleets already do. ldquo Using dash cam clips as positive reinforcement isn rsquo t common, rdquo Murray says, ldquo but the drivers in our survey were really excited about the possibility of that. rdquo Murray recommends incentivizing drivers with timely rewards , especially when drivers improve or reach a milestone. All achievements should be rewarded, no matter how small. ldquo You could say, lsquo Last month you had 10 hard braking incidents, this month you only had two. I rsquo m going to reward you for that, rsquo rdquo Murray says. To incentivize drivers, consider gamifying safety nbsp Set up a safety leader board Offer badges and free merchandise nbsp Inspire friendly competition, with prizes for the safest drivers and teams Gamifying safety makes it easy for drivers to track their progress and invest in safe performance . Safety managers and driving coaches should reward safe behavior soon after it happens. This helps to create a positive association that shapes the learning process . By associating safe driving with reward, drivers will want to repeat safe behaviors going forward. nbsp Incentivizing safe habits motivates drivers that much more. The more recognition you give them, the more empowered they rsquo ll be to reach their safety goals. 4. Ask your youngest drivers to champion dash cams Younger drivers grew up with technology. They expect to work with it. Fleets should capitalize on this expectation by choosing a pool of younger drivers to trial dual-facing dash cams. Younger drivers can then champion the cameras with older drivers. ldquo Younger drivers were born with a smartphone in their hand, so to speak, rdquo Murray says. ldquo They can serve as a strategic blueprint for increasing adoption of innovative technologies in commercial fleets. That includes dual-facing dash cams and other technologies that companies are looking to onboard. rdquo Explore the Motive AI Dashcam Onboarding dash cameras doesn rsquo t have to be a challenge. It rsquo s all in the approach. The Motive approach couldn rsquo t be easier. Learn what the AI Dashcam can do for your safety capabilities , and contact sales to continue the conversation.\n",

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the July 2023 report.\n",
            "Welcome to a special edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report, where we are taking a look at summer retail freight around Independence Day. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. nbsp Big Picture Stronger than expected Independence Day surge in retail truck visits is the first bright spot for retail and freight demand, but we still expect a muted 2H Trucking visits to top 50 retailer warehouses jumped 3 in the week leading up to July 4th, marking a 9 jump since a slower-than-average Memorial Day Weekend. Increase in retail freight traffic marks a 2023 peak for visits but is still well below the heights seen in previous years. Supply executives are bringing in inventory later, mirroring behavior seen during the 2022 holiday season. Retailers continue to adopt a wait-and-see approach in the current environment, suggesting a cautious outlook for consumer demand in the second half of the year. Despite the glimmer of hope with the July 4th surge, there is little optimism of demand surging back, and we expect a muted 2H. July 4th brought an unexpected surge in trucking visits to retail warehouses ndash the first positive sign amid the freight recession Though retail visits between Memorial Day and June 26 were largely muted, the final week leading into July 4th saw an unexpectedly strong week-over-week jump of 3 , as well as a 9 increase in traffic from the end of May. Thus far, retailers have been cautious and are adopting a wait-and-see approach when it comes to restocking due to uncertainties in predicting consumer demand, showing a reluctance to accumulate inventory levels similar to those observed last year. However, this late surge ahead of the start of peak season is one of the first positive signs we rsquo ve seen amid the current freight recession. Interestingly, the surge in retail trucking visits has typically happened in the second to last week before July 4 ldquo -2 rdquo in the graph above . This year, however, the surge came in the last week before the holiday June 26-July 3, ldquo -1 rdquo above . This means retailers are bringing in inventory much later than usual, which is consistent with the behavior we observed during the 2022 Christmas holiday season . Shifting headwinds inflation and supply chains The better-than-expected surge in retail visits may have been caused by a combination of factors. One factor could be the signs of easing inflationary pressures, indicated by only a slight increase in consumer prices in June . Another factor could be the improvement in supply chains, allowing for leaner operations and bringing in supplies closer to the actual demand. This is similar to what was observed during the Christmas period in 2022, when there was a three-week delay in the increase in visits. It seems that customer demand, rather than supply chain challenges, remains the main bottleneck affecting retail visits in 2023. Moving forward, the recent increase in traffic reaching a peak of 71 on our Big Box Retail Index is positive but falls short of previous years levels. It remains uncertain whether this late surge indicates a shift in demand or simply a change in the timing of retailers restocking in response to demand. nbsp Key Takeaway There s a glimmer of hope amidst the changing landscape. The potential upward trend in the market is encouraging, but it has significant implications for carrier planning as retailers adjust supply to match tighter demand windows. This highlights the importance of monitoring month-over-month and week-over-week trends in addition to year-over-year comparisons. A more capacity-focused supply chain with inventory management as the primary constraint means businesses will operate with leaner buying operations. Data Methodology This edition of the Motive Monthly Economic report looks specifically at retail traffic around the July 4th holiday. Each edition of the report uses aggregated and anonymized insights from the Motive network, as well as publicly available government data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, U.S. Census, and U.S. Department of Transportation.\n",

            "We rsquo ve grown accustomed to near real-time delivery. Order an item today, expect it on the doorstep tomorrow. Since 2020, demand for online orders has surged. Shippers have rushed to keep up. As one law firm notes, ldquo Services like two-day shipping can be a Pandora rsquo s Box . Once opened, it rsquo s hard to close. rdquo nbsp Today, expedited shipping is the norm and the expectation. Deliveries are getting faster. In April, the time between order placement and final delivery fell to an average of four days , down from 5.6 days one year earlier. Retailers aren rsquo t just forecasting faster delivery times. They rsquo re achieving them. While faster delivery is great for consumers, it rsquo s not great for road safety. About 30 of all accidents happen in the last-mile segment . And those accidents have an impact. nbsp A study by the World Health Organization found that a 5 increase in average speed leads to a 10 increase in accident-related injury. Get one step closer to safe on-time delivery. Deadline pressure increases last-mile risk The last mile of a product rsquo s journey, from the warehouse to the customer rsquo s doorstep, is the most time-consuming leg of the journey. Any slowdowns hinder drivers rsquo ability to meet strict delivery deadlines. As drivers push their limits, stress is compounded by Inclement weather Road construction Traffic congestion Failed delivery attempts Unfamiliar neighborhoods to navigate When pressure increases, unsafe driving increases. Drivers tend to drive distracted , speed , or become fatigued . Automated coaching drives real-time awareness To prevent these risks, last-mile fleets are investing in safety technology . Not just any safety technology. AI dash cams . Powered by artificial intelligence, AI dash cams identify and alert to unsafe driving behaviors in real time, driving down risk instantly. nbsp Tendencies like close following , distracted driving, and unsafe lane change trigger a dash cam alert that reminds drivers Increase your following distance.

            "In recent years, U.S. roads have gotten more dangerous, even with fewer vehicles on the road . To shed light on this important issue, Motive rsquo s Gary Johnson, head of safety and compliance strategy, and Joe Vignolo, director of Content Marketing, recently hosted the 2023 State of Safety webinar. The session explores key findings from Motive rsquo s State of Safety Report download it here , along with tips on how fleets can improve fleet safety performance. Watch the full webinar now. Here are some takeaways from the webinar. 95 of those surveyed said driver safety performance is a priority On the surface, a stat like this sounds promising, and it is. However, a deeper dive reveals that as much as commercial fleets prioritize safety, it rsquo s not always enough of one. When fleets ranked their top priorities for 2023, safety actually placed third. nbsp ldquo Safety is absolutely a priority, rdquo Johnson observes. ldquo However, is safety a priority or a value? Priorities change with the circumstances, but values never change. It rsquo s really a matter of perception. Fleets should be clear on how they rsquo re approaching safety and what their expectations are. rdquo Most fleets have invested in safety, but too many still haven rsquo t On the positive side, many fleets surveyed implemented new tools to improve safety last year, and others plan to invest before the year is over. However, the Motive State of Safety Report showed that many fleets are underinvested in driver safety initiatives and technology. Another 8 are ldquo drastically underinvested. rdquo nbsp ldquo It rsquo s positive that more than half of respondents are staying on top of safety investments, rdquo Johnson says. ldquo However, it is alarming that you have some who say they rsquo re still drastically behind. rdquo When dash cams use AI, fleet safety is even better When fleets implemented dash cams, they improved safety and profitability in several ways. But adding artificial intelligence to the mix enhanced fleet safety even more. nbsp ldquo Artificial intelligence really helps take fleet safety to the next level, rdquo Johnson says. By having the visibility of the camera and the intelligence of the technology, AI dash cams can identify and alert to unsafe driving behaviors with incredible precision. As Johnson explains it, ldquo The AI kicks in and says, lsquo Yep, that behavior is unsafe. And because it rsquo s unsafe, I rsquo m going to give an in-cab alert and allow for self-coaching. rsquo rdquo When unsafe events happen on the road, artificial intelligence is proactive, ensuring there rsquo s an immediate response instead of a lagging response. ldquo AI is such a key part of safety technology today, rdquo Johnson says. ldquo It rsquo s one thing to invest in safety technology. It rsquo s another to continue that investment as technology advances. Continuing your investment is really the key. rdquo nbsp Watch the webinar on demand for all the highlights from the 2023 State of Safety Report.

            "Fleet telematics empowers managers with valuable real-time insights enabling data-driven decision making. Vehicle tracking, performance analysis, driver behavior monitoring , compliance management, cost optimization, and route planning can all benefit from fleet telematics. See how leveraging vehicle telematics enables managers to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, improve safety, and make informed decisions to drive their fleets forward. Telematics transmits information remotely over long distances, making it critical to fleet operations for many industries. Whether in oil and gas, construction , food and beverage, agriculture, logistics, or another industry, being able to access data using a combination of GPS technology, sensors, and onboard diagnostics codes increases operational visibility. nbsp Real-time data transfer improves communications, efficiency, and customer service by providing transparency into vehicle location, driver behavior, vehicle activity, and asset diagnostics. Fleet telematics systems let fleet owners and managers manage their assets remotely using software located at a dispatch center or in the fleet manager rsquo s office. Discover Motive s fleet telematics solution How do fleet telematics solutions work? Fleets install telematics devices into vehicles to transmit data via telecommunications networks to the nbsp fleet management software to process information about vehicle location and usage, fuel consumption, maintenance issues, and more. Fleet managers can also gain insights into driver behaviors and asset idle time to identify at-risk drivers, improve safety, and cut costs. nbsp Commercial telematics devices generally connect to the vehicle rsquo s onboard systems, such as the engine, sensors , and GPS receiver. The device collects data from these sources using sensors, connectors, and interfaces mdash and often includes a modem for communication and internal storage for data logging. nbsp The collected data is then packaged and transmitted using cellular networks, satellite, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth , to a central server or cloud-based fleet management platform. Once it rsquo s received, it rsquo s stored for further processing and analysis. In this central hub, managers and others can access the data for analysis, visualization, and reporting. From here, fleet managers are empowered to make data-driven decisions and take appropriate actions. Fleet telematics solutions for improved decisions Telematics allows fleet managers to gather and analyze real-time data from vehicles and drivers. This data can provide valuable insights and inform decision making across various aspects of fleet management by helping to Analyze driver behavior and safety Optimize route planning and dispatching Support continuous improvement Identity preventive maintenance opportunities Simplify compliance Let rsquo s look at each of these points a little closer. Analyze driver behavior and safety Telematics devices collect data on driver behaviors including speeding, harsh braking, and excessive idling. Monitoring driver behavior, along with vehicle and equipment performance using data can help identify at-risk drivers and training opportunities. A fleet can build out its new driver onboarding around known issues and tailor its ongoing safety program to coach drivers in a continuously relevant way by analyzing telematics data. Additionally, the real-time GPS fleet telematics data can be immediately helpful in the event of an incident with the ability to direct emergency assistance where needed. Optimize route planning and dispatching Data-driven insights not only help improve driver safety and reduce accidents but also help to lower fuel consumption and optimize vehicle utilization . With real-time telematics data available, managers can monitor traffic conditions and congestion to minimize travel time and enhance operational efficiency. nbsp The at-the-moment insight into routes in combination with historical data can lead to reduced mileage, fuel consumption , and asset wear and tear as managers can optimize route planning. At the same time, the centralization of data reduces the need for drivers to check in with fleet managers. Automating much of the process lets drivers focus on their most important work and increases manager resources. This optimized route dispatch can also enhance customer service. With visibility into where assets are and estimated arrival times, companies can communicate more effectively with customers to manage expectations. Support continuous improvement Collecting telematics data gives the business a longer-term view of operations. By analyzing data for trends and patterns, managers can identify opportunities for improvements. nbsp For example, based on performance analysis of the data, drivers who are unnecessarily hard on vehicles might be identified and given targeted training. Or leverage telematics data to monitor fuel usage and optimize fuel efficiency. With the ability to analyze specific factors, managers can dig into the data to determine whether driving habits, idling time , or route selection are negatively impacting fuel consumption. This could lead to substantial fuel cost savings and lower emissions . Identify predictive maintenance nbsp opportunities Collecting data on various vehicle metrics can help fleets to schedule predictive maintenance and also identify potential issues before they lead to costly downtime. Fleet managers can enjoy a consolidated view of telematics data about fuel consumption or engine diagnostics along with maintenance schedules to identify patterns, detect potential issues, and make data-driven decisions about vehicle maintenance, repairs, and replacements. nbsp Simplify compliance The data collected by telematics systems can also assist with regulatory requirements and industry standard compliance. Instead of having to rely on manual reporting and hand-written logs, fleet managers can immediately collect data on driver hours of service or vehicle inspections to make decisions that ensure compliance, minimize violations, and avoid penalties. Get started with telematics for fleet management The amount of data available from telematics devices may feel overwhelming. Still, you can incorporate telematics into your fleet management in four straightforward steps. 1. Find a fleet telematics solution You rsquo ll find many telematics provider options available. Start by evaluating different telematics solutions based on criteria such as Fleet size Vehicle types Data you want to collect Specific goals e.g., fuel efficiency, driver safety, maintenance optimization Provider rsquo s track record and industry experience nbsp Customer reviews Range of services offered Ease of installation Solution scalability Compatibility with existing fleet management systems Customer support provided Price and return on investment Training and technical support 2. Set clear objectives and KPIs Take full advantage of the abundance of data from telematics systems by aligning relevant key performance indicators KPIs with your business objectives. Then, use the collected data to measure performance and assess success. nbsp For example, fleet managers might set KPIs around fuel efficiency by monitoring fuel usage data within the fleet. Examining fuel consumption, idling time, and driver behavior data can help identify areas for improvement. Managers might use the data to implement fuel-saving initiatives and monitor the impact of driver training programs or vehicle maintenance on fuel efficiency. Driver safety score KPIs can also be supported by telematics device data. Gathering data on speeding, harsh braking, rapid acceleration, and other unsafe driving practices, fleet managers can determine how well drivers follow safe driving practices. Tracking performance over time helps identify high-risk drivers who could benefit from targeted training programs. Telematics data could provide a more accurate picture also of vehicle utilization rate, maintenance cost per mile, average delivery time, compliance with regulatory requirements, customer satisfaction ratings, and more. 3. Monitor fleet telematics in real time and set alerts The immediacy of the data is a main benefit of telematics. Tracking vehicle locations and statuses in real time saves drivers from having to check in with fleet managers. Meanwhile, managers can set up alerts to notify them of issues such as hard braking, speeding , potential HOS violations, critical maintenance concerns found in vehicle inspections , and much more. With the tools to monitor activity and understand the data in a larger context, managers can make more data-driven decisions in critical situations or help avoid them altogether . GPS telematics data can also work with geofencing to establish virtual boundaries. This can help managers track vehicle entry and exit time in designated areas or prevent unauthorized vehicle usage . 4. Gather and analyze fleet telematics data Managers can access a wealth of information from telematics systems. This can include GPS location nbsp Vehicle diagnostics Speed, acceleration, and deceleration nbsp Idling Fuel consumption nbsp Maintenance and service nbsp Driver behavior Geofencing Hours of service Environmental nbsp Leverage the full power of this data by gathering and analyzing it. For instance, managers might look at mileage and engine hours to determine preventive maintenance needs. Or analyze driver behavior data to identify risky driving practices and improve overall safety. Integrating telematics data with other business systems can further streamline operations, automate processes, and improve the bottom line. By consolidating meaningful data in easily accessible dashboards, with the benefit of reporting and visualization tools, regular performance monitoring can become par for the course for your business. nbsp A telematics solution designed to improve decisions Fleet telematics devices integrated with fleet management software can benefit driver safety , optimize route planning , improve customer satisfaction, drive continuous improvement, streamline maintenance, and simplify compliance. nbsp Motive rsquo s comprehensive fleet management solution enables your business to harness the power of fleet telematics for improved performance through ongoing monitoring and adaptation. nbsp Telematics can benefit your fleet and business.

            "Discover the results of a new study on AI-based dash cam systems from Lytx, Samsara, and Motive, conducted by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute VTTI .\n",
            "Motive successfully alerts drivers 3-4x more than Samsara amp Lytx in new study. Safety management is more than a job it rsquo s a commitment mdash nbsp to understanding what rsquo s happening on the road, knowing which drivers are in need of attention, having evidence to back up incident investigations, and helping your fleet become safer and more profitable. And that rsquo s just for starters. nbsp It rsquo s a critical job. If drivers hit the road without proper training or become distracted behind the wheel, the consequences can be severe. Costly crashes lawsuits that can drag on for years injuries and deaths mdash lives and livelihoods are on the line. In fact, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA data on fatal accidents that involve large commercial vehicles show financial impacts can be as high as 7 million per incident. Even small settlements can top 400,000. nbsp Here are more startling statistics According to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration NHTSA , five distracted seconds at a speed of 55 mph is the same as driving the entire length of a football field with your eyes shut. NHTSA also found that 94 of the primary contributing factors to crashes were attributed to the driver . With statistics like these in mind, most fleets prioritize safety, often turning to AI dash cams for help. Unfortunately, products don rsquo t always measure up when you get them into your vehicles. To really work in the field, cameras must be highly reliable, meaning the AI actually needs to detect events in real time. Otherwise, you have an expensive video recording system that creates more problems than it solves. nbsp For safety leaders, it rsquo s critical to sift through the noise to find out what really works before making an investment. Especially when the safety and protection of their team of drivers, the communities on the roads all around them, and the companies they represent are at stake. That rsquo s why we called on one of the transportation industry rsquo s most respected safety voices, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute VTTI , to put our solution, and a couple of others, to the test. nbsp As a global authority on transportation systems and strategy, VTTI is continually advancing transportation through innovation. The institute has influenced public policy on driver, passenger, and pedestrian safety. Given their reputation, we asked VTTI to complete a sponsored study measuring the performance of on-road driver monitoring systems from three dash cam vendors Lytx, Samsara, and Motive. nbsp The test was specifically designed to look at unsafe driving maneuvers like close following, rolling stops, lack of seat belt use, texting, and phone use mdash the actions that lead to millions of collisions each year. Study Methodology VTTI conducted a series of tests to gauge how effectively drivers were alerted to unsafe driving behaviors, including Talking on the phone Close following Lap texting Rolling through stop signs Texting at a 45-degree angle Not wearing a seatbelt To ensure fairness, tests were conducted during the day, at night, and at twilight. Camera placement in the cab was rotated to give each camera equal time in each position. nbsp Like any study, this one had assumptions and limitations. For example VTTI rsquo s on-road testing looked at the dash cams rsquo ability to respond to unsafe behavior through in-cab alerts and dashboard notifications. Testing also assessed time-to-alert from the start of each task. The systems were tested in three positions, three times a day, with five replications for each day night test and three replications for each twilight test. Some controlled factors may impact system performance, including Weather conditions . The trials were conducted in generally clear conditions. The driver . All trials included the same commercial driver, a trained VTTI researcher. Variations in technology. The Lytx system wasn rsquo t evaluated for Rolling Stop alerts, because the Rolling Stop alert was deactivated for their customer base during the study. See what really happened Faster, more frequent in-cab alerts Throughout the study, ldquo Motive was associated with statistically significant, higher likelihoods to successfully issue an in-cab alert for phone calls, lap texting, 45-degree texting, close following, and rolling stops. rdquo Across all times of day and camera placements, the Motive AI Dashcam performed well at successfully alerting unsafe driving behaviors. For multiple unsafe driving behaviors, it alerted 3-4x more than the latest models from Samsara and Lytx. Why does this matter? Because when safety is in jeopardy, time rsquo s not on your side.

            "Make a seamless transition to your next tech provider with advice from one of the industry rsquo s leading consultants. Throughout his illustrious safety career, Clay Merches learned from the best. He soaked it all up like a sponge, advancing to bigger and bigger fleets. By the time he hung up his fleet safety boots in 2019, he was VP of Safety at Roadrunner, a 4,000-vehicle operation. Over a 25-year career, Merches led several provider transitions. As president of LEC, LLC Leading Edge Consulting , he now guides others through the process. What does he tell them? He describes his approach here in 7 simple steps. 5 signs it s time to switch providers 1. Understand the problem According to Merches, the search for a new technology provider starts with a problem. ldquo Can your current provider solve the problem or not? If not, you need to seek out a provider who can. rdquo nbsp Maybe your AI dash cams don rsquo t alert to unsafe behaviors as they should, and you need an alternative with more accurate AI detection . Maybe your fleet card isn rsquo t delivering the cost savings you believe you can get elsewhere, or your savings are being eroded through fees. nbsp The sooner you identify the issue, the sooner you can move on to a better solution. It helps to work with a provider with an all-in-one platform that lets you manage your fleet and your spend in one place. Doing so will bring 360-degree visibility to your operations and let you scale your business without risk. nbsp 2. Start dating Just like actual dating, the hunt for a new provider requires building relationships . Merches likes the dating analogy, because the provider search is all about chemistry and commitment. nbsp ldquo The chemistry you establish with a potential provider is as vital as the technology itself, rdquo he says. ldquo Do you prefer your new friend to your old friend? If so, assess the pros and cons of dating someone new and decide if the relationship is worth pursuing. If it feels like a match, you rsquo re ready to pilot the technology. rdquo 3. Ensure the provider rsquo s road map aligns with your long-term goals The challenges of today will evolve tomorrow. So make sure your potential new provider can solve your current pain points and allow for future growth. ldquo Think about future opportunities you rsquo ll need to solve for and if the provider is well-positioned to support you long-term, rdquo Merches says. nbsp If the provider wants to address your pain points, and their solutions will benefit your fleet for years to come, you rsquo ve found a strong partner. Providers like Motive are always building new products and enhancing those in use. When the Motive AI Dashcam was first released, for example, it detected cell phone use and close following. With recent enhancements, it now also detects unsafe lane changes, drowsy driving, and imminent forward collisions. In spend management , the Motive Card rsquo s new Savings Finder helps cut costs by making it easy for drivers to find the lowest fuel price in the area. Location mismatch alerts from the Motive Fleet Card notify managers of fraudulent transactions instantly, whenever vehicle location and fueling location don rsquo t match. Capabilities like these prevent theft and stop fraud in its tracks. 4. Assess the terms of your current contract Technology providers that offer AI dash cams and electronic logging devices ELDs typically have long-term contracts that expire after three or five years. If you rsquo re considering opting out, determine where you are in your commitment and what the penalty will be for terminating the contract early. Keep in mind, opting out doesn rsquo t come cheap, but some providers will subsidize the switch from a competitor. ldquo Cost is a big consideration, rdquo Merches says. ldquo Discuss it internally to see if you can afford it. Work with your new provider to see if they rsquo ll cover some of the costs, allowing you to leave your existing contract early. rdquo 5. Assess the cost of swapping out hardware The cost of uninstalling and re installing hardware is an issue for enterprise fleets. The cost of a rollout is calculated in lost time as much as anything. nbsp ldquo Swapping out dash cams or ELDs on 4,000 vehicles isn rsquo t an easy flip of the switch, rdquo says Merches. ldquo There rsquo s vehicle maintenance and install time to think about. Installation leads to downtime. Not just for vehicles, but for drivers and operations as well. Will you lose utilization? What s the cost of that? There rsquo s a lot to consider. Being prepared for disruption is half the battle. rdquo 6. Specify how the lsquo rules of the game rsquo will change with the new technology There rsquo s an art to rolling out safety technology . If you rsquo re switching dash cam providers, you rsquo re well aware of that already. Before you install the new solution, communicate your plans across the organization. Merches recommends taking the following steps before any rollout Educate internal staff on what rsquo s coming, and why it rsquo s coming . If you rsquo re implementing a different set of dash cams, make sure to communicate with everyone impacted by the decision. Include safety, compliance, and operations personnel, and most importantly, drivers. nbsp nbsp Educate the team about product features and enhancements . Explain how the new dash cams work, what their trigger points are, and how drivers and dash cams will interact. Will the dash cams be rolled out fleetwide, or just partially? Which drivers will get them first? Discuss which data points the dash cams will collect. As AI dash cams become more customized , fleets decide where they want to focus. Do you want to capture speeding events and ignore unsafe lane changes? Will you focus exclusively on distracted driving? Customization lets you design your safety program however you choose. Just be sure to educate drivers about your approach. 7. Share your excitement with peers Once the first wave of technology units has been installed and you rsquo ve started to see improvement, spread the word among colleagues and friends. The transportation industry is a close-knit community. People are quick to share their success. If AI dash cams and driver coaching helped you reduce accidents by 50 , for example, your peers will want to know about it. nbsp ldquo Singing the praises of your new provider builds connection between you and your colleagues, rdquo Merches says. ldquo What better way for people to learn about what works than from a friend. rdquo Share your success on LinkedIn as well. Platforms that offer a sense of community are a great way to share ideas and benchmark your success against the best. Ready for a change? We rsquo re ready for you. At Motive, partnership begins with customer service and an all-in-one platform that lets you manage your operations in one place.

            "Discover how Motive, a leader in AI-based technology, is dedicated to achieving Zero Harm and Zero Preventable Accidents on North America s roads.\n",
            "By Shoaib Makani, Motive co-founder and CEO 42,915 . That rsquo s the number of people who died in vehicle-related accidents last year in the U.S. alone. Road accidents were the leading cause of death for everyone 54 and under. With so many lives lost, this epidemic of road deaths hasn rsquo t received the attention it deserves. And sadly, the problem is getting worse, not better . A leading cause of this tragedy is hiding in plain sight mdash distracted driving. And the risks aren rsquo t limited to drivers. Last year saw more U.S. pedestrians killed than at any other time in the last 40 years . For fleet operators, the cost of these accidents is both personal and professional. Putting vehicles on the road with so much at stake is a tremendous responsibility. Anything can happen at any time, and safety and fleet managers are under constant pressure to be prepared for it all. When a collision occurs, the cost of accidents is just beginning. There rsquo s vehicle damage, medical bills, and potential litigation to worry about, not to mention the welfare of those involved. The arrival of AI-based cameras is helping put an end to this epidemic of distracted driving, preventable accidents, and lives lost. Artificial intelligence gives us a chance to really impact the safety of our roadways, but to make a difference, commercial fleets need accurate and reliable AI that detects and alerts to unsafe driving behavior in real time. Accurate AI detection is crucial ndash it rsquo s the difference between preventing an accident and picking up the pieces after it happens. Using AI to detect risk in real time can fend off injury, prevent accidents, and create a more achievable path to Zero Harm . Companies and organizations like GM , Honeywell , Vision Zero Network , and the National Safety Council have started working toward the goal of Zero Harm. Road safety is personal for me. It s personal for each one of our customers and our employees. And it should be personal for everyone who shares our roads. That rsquo s why, today, Motive is committing to Zero Harm and Zero Preventable Accidents on North America rsquo s roadways. We rsquo ve been on this path for the last five years. In that time, we rsquo ve helped our customers prevent accidents mdash by up to 65 for some. Together, imagine what we rsquo ll be able to achieve in the next five years. To some, attaining zero preventable accidents on North America rsquo s roads has felt like a pipe dream. Is it even possible? We think it is and it s the right thing to do. That rsquo s why we rsquo re setting this goal. Accident prevention is made possible through risk detection that is both instant and precise. Despite numerous claims from vendors about how their advanced AI capabilities ensure driver safety, the reality often reveals inaccurate or slow AI-based detection systems. While having any accident prevention technology is better than having none, not all AI-based detection tools are equally as effective. We take the responsibility of getting it right very seriously. It rsquo s why we asked one of the most renowned transportation voices in the country, the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute VTTI , to complete a landmark study to measure the performance of on-road driver monitoring systems from three dash cam providers Lytx, Samsara, and Motive. The results speak for themselves. Through 234 tests, VTTI assessed 6 unsafe driving categories. They looked at close following, rolling stops, texting, and phone use mdash the actions that lead to hundreds of thousands of collisions each year. Motive successfully identified and alerted to unsafe driving behavior 86 of the time mdash compared to 21 for Samsara and 32 for Lytx . VTTI found that Motive was associated with statistically significant, higher likelihoods to successfully issue in-cab and dashboard alerts for phone calls, texting, close following, and rolling stops. These differences become even more dramatic as light conditions change at different times of day, with Samsara and Lytx alert success dropping at night. While these results are stunning, they rsquo re not surprising. Strategy Analytics ran a similar test last year and came to similar conclusions. The report clearly showed that Motive was the most accurate AI dash cam when compared to other leading competitors in the market, Samsara, and Lytx. nbsp But these results aren rsquo t about our competitors. They rsquo re about the driver who wants to make it home safely at the end of the day the safety manager intent on keeping their communities safe and their company profitable and the motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians who share the road with commercial vehicles every day. nbsp The reality is, the transport of people, products, and materials is complex for two simple reasons mdash mass and velocity. Tens of thousands of pounds traveling at highway speeds means the consequence of a collision is catastrophic. nbsp The value of human life cannot be measured, of course, but the soaring cost of accidents also cannot be ignored. The average cost of a fatal collision involving a large commercial vehicle is 3.6 million . With so much at stake, we have to be committed to doing zero harm. So does every commercial fleet on the road. The time is now to end the devastation on our roadways, and you can help. Commit to this pledge with us. Join the movement to get to Zero Harm and Zero Preventable Accidents. nbsp Benchmarking your fleet rsquo s safety success is easy with the right tools. If you rsquo d like to do a test like the one VTTI conducted, get in touch. We rsquo ll share the whole methodology with you. You rsquo ll have a crystal clear view of the power of accurate AI vision, and understand how it can bring your fleet closer to zero harm. nbsp\n",

            "Switching telematics providers is like going to the dentist. No one wants to do it, but wait too long and your problems could get worse. Besides, how can you tell when it rsquo s really time to switch providers? ldquo When the cost of doing nothing becomes too great, you rsquo ll know it rsquo s time to switch, rdquo says Clay Merches, president of LEC, LLC Leading Edge Consulting . nbsp As a consultant to transportation businesses, Merches advises fleets on provider relationships all the time. A former VP of Safety, he rsquo s seen the warning signs and knows the perils of ignoring them. If you rsquo re seeing red flags in your program like the ones below, start shopping for a new telematics provider. Customer service is lacking Being a fleet manager is tough enough without the hassle of poor customer service. Poor customer service isn rsquo t just an inconvenience. It hinders productivity, fuels frustration, and makes you feel like a number. You can tell a lot about a provider rsquo s culture by the way their sales team follows up. Or doesn rsquo t. nbsp Look for a provider that offers exceptional customer service and 24 7 support to help resolve issues quickly. Motive Chat , for example, gives customers a smart new tool for solving important issues in real time. ldquo I don rsquo t even have to pick up the phone, rdquo says Motive customer Heather Walerius . ldquo If a driver has a question about something, I just do a simple chat and continue doing what I need to do. rdquo nbsp The product is out of stock ldquo As your fleet grows and transitions away from equipment, your current provider may have an issue with product availability, rdquo Merches says. ldquo Perhaps the chip shortage has caused a lack of supply. Or suddenly you have more vehicles than your provider can accommodate. Fleets evolve, and when hardware is hard to come by, the provider is unable to evolve with them. rdquo Safety performance isn rsquo t what it should be If your safety solution isn rsquo t delivering the results you expect, it may not be your imagination. Some solutions are better at recognizing and alerting to unsafe driving behaviors than others. A recent Motive-sponsored study by the Virginia Tech Technology Institute VTTI showed that the Motive AI Dashcam successfully alerted to unsafe driving behaviors 3-4x times more than Samsara and Lytx. nbsp Across all times of day and camera placements, Motive performed well at successfully alerting drivers to safety issues in real time. nbsp A slight delay in alerting can make the difference between life and death. With the stakes so high, fleets aren rsquo t willing to take that chance. They want to protect their drivers with the fastest, most accurate AI around , and they rsquo ll switch providers to do it. There rsquo s a lack of transparency ldquo If you rsquo re constantly being surprised by invoices, your telematics provider probably isn rsquo t being upfront with you, rdquo Merches says. ldquo Clients who are ready to switch are at a tipping point. They ve been struggling for several months and the current provider is just flipping the bill, failing to provide options and resources the customer wants to drive forward to. rdquo nbsp Fleet card customers , for example, often face hidden fees . Some providers charge a monthly fee for each card, and another fee for using the card at certain fueling centers. Hidden fees can add up quickly, leaving customers reeling. With today rsquo s inflationary pressures, fleets are looking to trim costs however they can. Switching to a fleet card with no hidden fees is an easy way to improve profit margins. Equipment is outdated Older tech solutions don rsquo t always function like updated models. ldquo Fleets with legacy systems get short-changed on video quality, for example, rdquo Merches says. ldquo You may decide to invest in a 4k or 8k camera system that offers HD video and a crystal-clear picture of what rsquo s happening on the road. rdquo nbsp With a resolution of up to 1440p, Motive rsquo s AI technology captures every incident in high-definition HD . Enhanced visibility on the Motive AI Dashcam clearly shows when your drivers aren rsquo t at fault, quickly exonerating them from wrongful blame. In the court of law, a high-definition picture can easily persuade juries, protecting fleets from multimillion-dollar payouts . Why settle for a provider that rsquo s not meeting your needs? Don rsquo t wait until the cost of doing nothing becomes too great. Contact the Motive sales team to inquire about switching providers today. Still undecided?

            "Welcome to the August edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report, where we analyze the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform during the past month. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. nbsp Big Picture The freight recession is moving upmarket, trucking jobs decline, and after a stronger than expected July 4th, retail demand has corrected. July data showed continued declines in US carriers, but with a key difference fleets of 5 vehicles or less that are exiting fell by 5 , meaning more exits were mid-sized to larger fleets than we rsquo ve seen in 2023. Motive expects the current rate of contraction to continue, and more truck drivers could be unemployed as a result. Retail demand trended back downward post-July 4th, showing a 15 year-over-year decline. The freight recession may be a ldquo detox rdquo from the pandemic rsquo s artificial demand highs, as ecommerce growth is now back in line with pre-pandemic 10 year averages. Freight recession moves upmarket July brought another month of contraction in the number of authorized carriers, and a larger portion of them were fleets of 5 vehicles or more from 12 to 17 . Early in the freight recession smaller carriers got hit hardest by changing retail diesel and freight spot market prices, but as the conditions have continued, the larger fleets are feeling the effects more significantly. Evidence of this can be found in the recent news about Yellow filing for bankruptcy . New carrier starts continue reversion to pre-pandemic levels Not only have trucking jobs decreased in consecutive months June and July for the first time since early in the pandemic, but there are also fewer opportunities for displaced drivers. As more companies are leaving the market see above for Change in Authorized for Hire Carriers Index , new carrier starts declined over 7 in July, continuing the trend of reverting to 2019 levels and marking a 29 decline since the beginning of the year. Motive rsquo s data suggests the current rate of contraction to continue, meaning that more and more truck drivers could continue to hit the job market as these conditions persist. After a 4th of July surge, retail demand shifts downward again Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index that observes trucking visits to warehouses for the top 50 retailers in the US dropped in the last two weeks of July, showing a year-over-year decline of 15 . The first two weeks of July which included July 4th and Amazon rsquo s Prime Day seem to have marked the peak of demand for 2023 given this downshift. This further supports the idea that the freight recession will remain through the rest of 2023. Plummeting toward hellip normal? According to recent data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve , the downturn in e-commerce retail sales growth has actually brought it back in line with pre-pandemic 10-year averages. While the downturn in consumer demand and the resulting freight recession have been challenging for many carriers, it may also represent a ldquo detox rdquo from the artificial highs of consumer demand and gross margins during the pandemic. Similar to mortgage interest rates now being at more historically common levels, it may be that trucking rsquo s lack of growth is less a catastrophe and more a reversion to normal levels. U.S. Census Bureau, E-Commerce Retail Sales as a Percent of Total Sales ECOMPCTSA , retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis https fred.stlouisfed.org series ECOMPCTSA, August 4, 2023. Key takeaway In this challenging market, efficiency is king The pandemic created highly favorable economics for trucking companies with unprecedented demand as people spent more on goods than services. This created high rates for moving goods. Diesel prices were low, so these companies saw increased revenue growth. nbsp At the same time, interest rates were low and consumers and businesses received government stimulus. Some companies preserved cash while others spent it. But as consumer demand trends lower, retailers bring in inventory closer to demand, and rates continue to increase, businesses focused on operational efficiency and preserving cash are better prepared to weather the storm. In short, the focus for freight businesses right now and going forward has to be efficiency.

            "Ann Danko, Director of Safety and Compliance, Reliable Carriers ldquo I was born with diesel flowing through me, rdquo says Ann Danko, director of safety and compliance at Reliable Carriers . She says it with a laugh, but it could be true. Her grandfather worked for C amp O Railroad for 44 years, and he operated a small fleet of dump trucks. Her parents were owner-operators called the Driving Force, delivering expedited freight. With more than 30 years of transportation experience, Danko is a driving force all her own. She rsquo s spent the last nine years at Reliable Carriers, the largest specialized auto transporter in the United States. Reliable is a place where customers expect the best and people like Danko are quick to deliver it. nbsp In a recent interview, she talked about everything that sets Reliable Carriers apart from the competition, including the company rsquo s safety culture mdash which she champions. Safety starts at the top We rsquo re never stagnant. That mindset starts with our owner, Tom Abrams, who gets the word out that fleet safety comes first. It has to come first, because we re a rolling billboard. Our brand is our reputation. So the safety culture starts at the top and is universal throughout the entire company. Recruit and reward professional drivers We have about 300 drivers. They rsquo re specialized car handlers. They operate a piece of machinery that is 80,000 pounds, 75 feet long, and they take it up and down the roads all day, every day. They drive in inclement weather, construction, and heavy traffic. You name it, they rsquo ve seen it. We have drivers who have been working here for 30 years or more. There s something to be said about that. Recently, someone called with a compliment for one of our drivers. So I thanked him for how he rsquo s behaving on the road. I wrote him a thank you card and put 100 in there. nbsp People always pick up the phone when there s something to complain about. Very rarely do you see people picking up the phone to say ldquo Thank you for doing a good job. rdquo I believe in thanking our drivers. It gives them a boost. Spark a little competition Our drivers are competitive. We use driver scorecards, and they track their scores closely. A driver just called to say, ldquo I dropped a point, why? rdquo They want to know how they can get better. You know what we do when we have a driver call? We do a deep dive to find out why they dropped. Were there too many hard braking events, too many speeding events? We look into it and let the drivers know. And you know what happens? The next week, nbsp they rsquo re better. And the week after that, they re better. They want to improve, so they do. And we definitely hear them talking proudly about their scores in the driver rsquo s lounge all the time. A little friendly competition is good for everyone. Use technology to have visibility, be proactive and coach The AI dash cams we have show exactly which drivers to coach, and which behaviors to coach them on. Through our fleet dashboard, we track fleet safety performance on big screens right in the office. nbsp nbsp Our drivers live and work all over the United States. So when an unsafe driving event happens, we call the driver and coach them over the phone . That rsquo s our first line of defense. Motive gives us real-time alerts to let us know exactly what rsquo s happening on the road, and we take it from there. Emphasize the positive When a driver gets a compliment, I enter that into our systems. I don rsquo t want to just look at the negative. I want to look at the positive and see the overall picture. I know some people focus on the negative, but that doesn rsquo t boost morale. That doesn rsquo t make drivers want to go out and do their best. You gotta give them positive feedback . Motive helps me do that. Keep learning For 63 years, Reliable Carriers has made a name for itself delivering vehicles to celebrities, auction houses, and everyday folks. During the pandemic, when other fleets were pinching pennies, we ramped up our investment in safety technology . We re always looking for ways to improve. And Motive is right there with us. Right now, we rsquo re testing side and rear cameras on our trailers, and they show us exactly what happens in an incident. Having side and rear cameras in addition to the forward-facing AI Dashcams gives us four views and nearly a 360-degree view of what rsquo s happening in our fleet. It rsquo s really opened our eyes, and we can rsquo t wait to install them throughout our entire fleet. Safety drives profitability We re not a manufacturer. We don t build anything. We rsquo re about service and being on time, damage free. Having a strong safety culture helps us remain profitable. It helps us continue to be the largest specialized auto transporter in the whole United States.

            "Safety manager of Page Transportation, Scott Crawford, talks about driver and roadway safety, and how Motive has helped his fleet exonerate drivers.\n",
            "Page Transportation Safety Manager Scott Crawford admits he was not immediately sold on electronic logging devices ELDs and dash cameras. Fast forward a few years, and Crawford concedes, ldquo Now here I am on the other side of the camera and I rsquo m the biggest proponent of it. rdquo What made him change his mind? We found out in a conversation about the ways ELDs and dash cameras benefit his safety team at the trucking and logistics company in Weedsport, New York. An edited transcript of the discussion follows. First, we asked Crawford to share how he became safety manager for Page Transportation Inc. rsquo s nearly 300 fleet vehicles. nbsp Scott Crawford on ELDs and dash cams I drove trucks for 25 years. I had my own trucking company. I sold it about seven years ago. I rsquo d been on the road forever and wanted to scale back. I ended up at Page and driving locally. Then, the safety manager position came open and I got nudged into it. nbsp I rsquo ve been doing this for almost two years now, and I really enjoy it. It keeps me in an industry I love and Page is a great place to work. I also think it helps being an ex-driver because I can relate more. It rsquo s hard to teach someone or coach someone when you rsquo ve never done it. It gives our safety team a lot better communication with the drivers. nbsp Page already had its ELDs in place when Crawford took on his role, but his safety team has spearheaded the effort to get dash cams widely accepted. The transition met some challenges. nbsp We have about 300 trucks, but about 80 are owner operators . These drivers don rsquo t want somebody spying on them. A lot of times people don rsquo t like the camera because they say, ldquo If I nbsp did something wrong, that rsquo s going to prove that I did something wrong. rdquo I tell them, ldquo Yes, it is, but it also lets us set up our defense to begin with and if you rsquo re in the wrong we need to settle this as quickly as possible. rdquo Exonerating drivers nbsp Fleet safety technology has helped with exonerating drivers, Crawford says. nbsp The cameras help place the blame where it has to be. We rsquo ve had three or four exonerations. Even with a forward-facing camera , you can show our truck didn rsquo t change lanes and you can get that footage to the driver when they are still on the scene. They can show the police officer the facts and they will ticket the other driver. Improving driver behavior The technology is all the more important now as there rsquo s more traffic on the road and driving behaviors are changing, according to Crawford. There rsquo s a lot more technology in cars and trucks and I think a lot of drivers are getting distracted . Lane departure and collision avoidance things are great, but some of that technology gives a false sense of security. People depend too much on the technology and are not paying attention to their surroundings the way they used to. So, we want to be proactive. All of our company equipment has Motive equipment in it. We rsquo re also doing a beta test with Motive of the side-view cameras AI Omnicam . Most of any collisions we have mdash probably 75 in this past year mdash are side impact. So, that rsquo s going to be a great tool for us. We want to have the AI inward-outward facing cameras too to see if we have drivers following too close or on the phone. We rsquo re not using those on everybody at this point. nbsp Getting feedback on Motive dash cams Overall, Motive benefits Page in many ways, Crawford says. Even the most vocal opponents among drivers are now fans. nbsp The drivers sometimes say ldquo You don rsquo t need to tell me how to drive. rdquo But I ask them to just try it, see how it can help them to coach themselves. nbsp One of our drivers goes around telling people how every day now he sees all these things almost happen and he thinks ldquo Wow, if that was just a little bit different that camera would have saved me. rdquo nbsp For our safety team, it rsquo s great to have support making our drivers better at what they do. You have a camera with a hard brake, and you can call the driver up and say This is because you were following too close or it was six seconds before you responded to that lane change. rdquo nbsp We don rsquo t coach on everything that comes across. We look at it on a case by case basis, but we rsquo ll call the driver if we think it rsquo s serious. nbsp The dash camera video saves us a lot of time. Back when I first started, I looked at a lot of video. Now, we look at 60-75 of what I was looking at. So it does work. nbsp We ve even had drivers call us up to say ldquo Hey, you rsquo re going to see this, and I wanted to let you know. rdquo So, it s obviously making them more aware. Asked what he rsquo d say to someone else considering Motive, Crawford recommended embracing technology instead of fighting it. It rsquo s a good product. We rsquo ve made a lot of asks of Motive, and some strange situations, and we rsquo ve had outstanding customer support. I believe Motive rsquo s gone above and beyond to customize things for us.

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the September 2023 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the September edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report, where we analyze the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform during the past month. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Big Picture Key metrics in retail visits, number of carriers, and carrier starts all improved in August, reversing consistent declines seen throughout 2023. However, potential headwinds are on the horizon, particularly for smaller fleets. While August retail visits didn rsquo t match the highs driven by the 4th of July holiday the previous month, they still bested June and rose year over year. August brought the lowest net carrier exits since Q1, with 24 fewer leaving the market compared to July. Registration of new carriers also rose in August, an unexpected jump potentially driven by the relative consistency in freight rates over the last six months. While this data shows positive momentum, the expectation of these trends continuing should be tempered. Drivers saw fewer hours and miles driven in August, and rising diesel prices increasing credit costs are likely to have a disproportionate impact on smaller fleets. Motive still expects overall contraction to continue into early 2024 therefore, fleets must continue to prioritize operational efficiency. Prepare for the worst but hope for the best Economic indications from Motive rsquo s August data were better than expected and may even be a cause for cautious optimism. However, carriers ndash especially smaller fleets ndash should still be planning for potential challenges ahead. Diesel price fluctuations and higher borrowing costs disproportionately impact small fleets. Doubling down on operational efficiency and preserving cash will help fleets of all sizes protect their bottom line. The focus for freight businesses right now and going forward must be efficiency. Carrier declines soften While August still saw declines in the net number of authorized carriers, the contraction was the smallest seen since March of this year. 24 fewer carriers exited the freight market compared to July, marking one of the first positive signs in months for our capacity indicator. It is worth noting that one driver of this may be stabilization after many smaller carriers have been driven out of the market. An unexpected jump in new carrier starts nbsp nbsp Registrations for new carriers also saw a surprising jump in August, with 17 more carriers entering the market compared to July. Relative stability of freight rates in the last six months may be a factor here, creating a stable enough environment to encourage new business formations. However, the impacts of rising oil and diesel prices on these new carriers has yet to be seen, so a single month can rsquo t yet be considered the start of a trend. August retail visits up compared to June as results of retailer inventory management efforts start to show August continued the upward overall trend of Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index, which observes trucking visits to warehouses for the top 50 retailers in the US. While still down from the July 4th holiday spike, the index was up 8.1 compared to June, and the relative decrease in August year over year improved. However, this return of retail visits following a lackluster start to 2023 is due less to rising consumer demand and is more a reflection of retailers consistently bringing down their inventories, allowing for more normalized restocking patterns. Motive still expects contraction of the market to continue into early 2024 While August saw improving retail and carrier data, not every indicator showed improvement. Along with reports of a sharp decline in trucking jobs in August, Motive rsquo s data showed decreased driver utilization measured by mileage driven per week across carriers of all sizes, as well as a drop in the hours driven per week. The latter metric was especially true for the smallest carriers with 1-5 vehicles and midsized fleets ranging from 20-250 vehicles. In addition, headwinds including rising diesel prices and consistently elevated interest rates are maintaining an environment of high operating costs that will disproportionately impact these smaller fleets. Overall, we expect the contraction of the market to continue into early 2024, with volumes following similar trends to 2019 and carrier numbers still being severely inflated due to the 2021 bump. Data Methodology The Motive Monthly Economic Report uses aggregated and anonymized insights from the Motive network, as well as publicly available government data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, U.S. Census, and U.S. Department of Transportation.\n",

            "In trucking, fuel discounts are the default way to quickly cut fuel costs. While fuel expenses are undeniably a significant portion of vehicle-based costs mdash upwards of 28 mdash there is still 72 of all other operating expenses to consider when tapping into a fleet rsquo s full saving potential. Fleet card adoption is one of the most common strategies used to offset variable pump prices and fuel expenses, but in many cases hidden fees can erode these promised savings. While fuel discounts do offset these expenses, they often aren rsquo t enough to address the multifaceted cost centers that trucking companies face, including Repair and maintenance costs Truck trailer lease or purchase payments Truck insurance premiums Driver wages and benefits nbsp Fraud and fuel theft The list goes on. And this is exactly why most fleet card providers have it wrong ndash they only address a small piece of the pie when it comes to total cost of operations, ignoring the savings insights that could be gained by sharing data between fleet and spend management. nbsp There are better ways to save than fuel discounts Businesses that rely on fuel discounts alone to reduce costs cannot effectively identify the broader financial saving opportunities across their operations. nbsp This is due to the fact most fleet card vendors cannot also provide Advanced spend controls backed by real-time telematics data that proactively reduces the cost of fraud.

            "Recent ATRI research highlights that fleets that don rsquo t use dual-facing dash cams DFDC face increased liability. Still, some fleets remain hesitant to adopt in-cab cameras, citing privacy concerns and potential driver churn. DFDCs give fleets a range of benefits beyond offering indisputable evidence in defense of drivers. DFDCs equip fleets with actionable insights, enabling them to pinpoint and correct risky driving behaviors before they become an issue. But with attrition rates pushing towards 100 on an annual basis, things that negatively impact employee retention are dealt with very carefully. nbsp nbsp nbsp So what rsquo s the real story? Our team dove into the data to better understand the impact of dual-facing dash cams on driver retention. What we found should give fleet leaders confidence - DFDCs actually cause driver retention rates to go up. Dash cam type doesn rsquo t impact driver retention For this study, we compared retention rates between three driver groups DFDC users, road-facing dash cam RFDC users, and fleets operating without cameras. We analyzed data from 31,028 drivers across 65 active Motive fleets. Fleets had 250 to 1,000 active vehicles in the past two months. nbsp Our findings were clear dash cam type does not impact driver retention. There rsquo s no retention difference between fleets using DFDCs, RFDCs, or no cameras. In fact, fleets using DFDCs saw a 3 increase in driver retention after 75 weeks when benchmarked against RFDC users. To ensure a thorough analysis, we analyzed the weekly retention of drivers onboarded between December 28, 2020, and December 27, 2021. This gave us at least 75 weeks worth of data. Implementing more DFDCs doesn rsquo t affect driver retention Diving into specific fleet data, it rsquo s evident that adopting more DFDCs doesn t negatively affect driver retention. We saw this across fleets of all sizes, from those with 800 vehicles to those managing a fleet of 4,000 . Fleets with DFDCs tend to retain drivers longer In fact, fleets using DFDCs tend to retain drivers longer than those with RFDCs, as evident in this fleet with 800 vehicles. Crash rates halved after reaching 90 DFDC adoption. A notable observation from our study is the sharp drop in crash rates for a U.S. nationwide fleet with 4,000 vehicles. After reaching 90 DFDC adoption, the fleet saw a 50 reduction in their crash rate, dropping from 0.4 to 0.2 crashes per 10,000 miles in just 10 months. Our analysis, leveraging Motive s robust crash data, traced crashes per 10,000 miles, both pre- and post-90 DFDC adoption. In general, as the percentage of DFDCs increases, crash rates go down accordingly. nbsp Explore the Motive dual-facing AI Dashcam How to improve driver acceptance of dual-facing dash cams The data is clear the advantages of our dual-facing dash cams significantly outweigh any concerns about driver resistance.

            "Welcome to Motive rsquo s first-ever Holiday Outlook Report! The report looks at the current State of Freight, State of Retail, and State of Safety as we enter peak freight season with predictions for what to expect this holiday season and heading into 2024. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Big Picture In 2023, we ve experienced continued rebalancing following the economic surge driven by the pandemic and oversupply of capacity. These have shrunk and restrained the market. The trend is expected to continue into Q4 and early 2024, so carriers should adjust their plans accordingly. Climbing diesel prices are causing more financial stress for carriers. Carrier exits and new carrier starts trended back downward after brief improvement in August, but driver retention since 2022 has improved. nbsp The Motive Big Box Retail Index improved slightly, as retailers may be slowly ramping up at a higher rate than in 2022. Motive still expects overall contraction of the market and relatively delayed restocking to continue through the holiday season and into early 2024. nbsp Safety on the road becomes an increased concern for carriers around the holidays, especially on December 23 when collisions can more than double. In this economic climate, operational efficiency is one of the only things within a business rsquo s control. Therefore, it will be the key to carriers having a happy new year. State of Freight Motive rsquo s new Financial Health Index tracks financial health among carriers measured by payment delays and its correlation with fluctuations in diesel prices. 2023 has seen a strong correlation of higher fuel costs and increased financial stress. Though the summer brought some reprieve, net carrier exits from the market have continued to increase through 2023. New carrier starts, which saw a pop during the pandemic and for a short time afterward, have also steadily decreased in 2023. One metric that has seen improvement has been driver retention, where we have seen a 5 improvement from 2022 to 2023. Though overall churn remains a challenge, more drivers are staying put, particularly in industries like passenger transport, retail, and warehousing. The market and workers are craving stability With carriers consistently exiting the market, new carrier starts trending downward, and diesel price fluctuations driving financial stress, 2023 showed how impactful volatility can be for carriers. More drivers staying put indicates what they and the wider market desire more stability, both in their operations and the overall marketplace. As carriers have continued to struggle with post-pandemic market shifts, it will be crucial that they stabilize operations as much as possible. This includes prioritizing operational efficiency and appropriate spend management for the busy holiday season and heading into 2024. Diesel price swings are creating more financial stress Diesel prices, one of the biggest input costs for carriers, saw major fluctuations in 2023. Prices gradually declined from March to June but then surged 18 from July to September. Financial stress, which is measured as the change in payment delays for carriers, saw tight correlation with these swings. For every 50 cents diesel prices increased in 2023, Motive saw a 30 increase in companies financial stress. As credit delinquencies overall continue to increase , this financial stress particularly impacts smaller carriers. They have not seen spot rates increase at the same rate as diesel prices and are seeing their revenues squeezed at a time when debt options are more limited . Since September, financial stress has improved somewhat in correlation with diesel prices falling, but this simply shows that businesses that can cope with the price fluctuations are able to stay afloat, while smaller businesses that can rsquo t are more likely to be adversely affected Carrier exits and starts shift back toward record highs nbsp nbsp The number of carriers exiting the market increased in September, moving back toward the record highs seen in Q2. This indicates that the decreases last month were likely an anomaly versus signs of a changing trend. At the same time, new carrier starts saw a 10 drop, which also brought it back in line with Q2 and the overall decreases we rsquo ve seen in 2023. When the market will return to a level aligned with demand relies on external factors like diesel price fluctuations and interest rates. Driver churn drops amid economic uncertainty Companies that transport goods and people, like trucking and passenger transit, have struggled for a long time to retain drivers, but driver retention saw some improvement between 2022 and 2023. The number of drivers leaving their jobs each quarter went down by 5 , bringing it to 14.9 . Industries seeing the largest improvement include passenger transport, retail, and warehousing. However, this improvement might be due to carriers leaving the market, and hiring slowing down, limiting drivers job choices and making them more likely to stay where they are. State of Retail The Motive Big Box Retail Index improved in September, indicating that retailers are slowly replenishing warehouse inventories in preparation for the upcoming holiday shopping season. In addition, retailers that don rsquo t sell consumables like groceries may already be matching inventories to demand more closely, which would be a step toward stabilization of the market. We foresee retailers staying cautious, waiting until the last minute to match inventory with demand due to the prevailing risk-averse climate, even though the holiday season may pick up speed compared to 2022. Anticipate delayed inventory ramp-ups, and adjust accordingly With capacity running higher and supply chains operating leaner, carriers should anticipate that retailers are likely to ramp up their inventories closer to when they rsquo re needed for the foreseeable future. Doing so will help to account for potentially slower periods ahead of holiday ramp-ups, particularly due to recent decreases in consumer demand . Retailers start increasing volumes again Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index, which observes carrier trips to warehouses of the top 50 retailers in the US, saw slight improvement in September up 1.2 points to 74.7 . This continues a gradual upward trend following record lows in Q1 2023. After spending the first half of 2023 depleting excess stock, this data suggests retailers have slowly begun building inventories back up ahead of the 2023 holiday shopping season. Notably, when we exclude retailers that sell consumables such as groceries from our analysis, we see that the first half of 2023 saw relatively low inventories, but the second half has been significantly stronger. This may indicate that the biggest retailers are moving towards better alignment of inventories with demand, which would be a step toward stabilization of the market. Though the gap between where the Big Box Retail Index stood in 2021 and now is still wide, September rsquo s numbers bring us closer to where retail visits were in 2022. On a related note, we anticipate that, similar to 2022 , the ramp up in holiday restocking will still be delayed by roughly 3 weeks compared to previous years. Throughout 2023, retailers continued the trend of stocking up closer to peak demand periods rather than holding excess inventory for extended periods before holiday surges. State of Safety nbsp Safety can rsquo t be overlooked during the holidays Safety is more important than ever around the peak retail and, thus, peak freight holiday season when events like severe weather and busy roads are stacked against operators. It rsquo s critical to implement tools and protocols to protect drivers, ensure productivity, and keep the roads safer for everyone at this time of year. Increased violations, severe weather correlate with uptick in collisions Over the holidays, the businesses driving the physical economy make sure our gifts are delivered, our grocery shelves are stocked, and our homes are warm. Trucking plays a significant role, moving roughly 72 of the nation rsquo s freight by weight annually. But statistics show that more trucks on the road means higher risk of accidents, and the holidays often amplify this risk. nbsp Last year, we saw a 14 increase in critical speeding events around the holidays, likely due to the rush and demand associated with this time of year. In fact truck collisions more than doubled on December 23 in particular. Severe weather was another factor, as December 23 of last year also saw 73 of accidents happen at locations impacted by snowy, icy, and wet conditions. Finally, hours of service violations also tick up during the holidays, with December 2022 seeing a 10 increase, and December 2019 seeing a 28 jump. Looking ahead Predictions for the holiday season and 2024 The trucking market rsquo s contraction will continue We at Motive don rsquo t anticipate the contraction of the overall trucking market to abate going into the holiday season and early 2024. The capacity glut created in the aftermath of the pandemic rsquo s spending boom is still here, and current economic conditions aren rsquo t showing signs of that changing. Cost and demand volatility will carry into 2024 Diesel and insurance prices will continue to be volatile through the first half of 2024. Excess capacity will need to decrease and prices will need to go up in order for the freight market to be more stable. Consumer demand will also need to at least maintain or even grow to match capacity, which we don rsquo t see happening in early 2024. Fewer drivers will seek to change jobs nbsp Driver retention statistics in 2023 may indicate carriers will be part of a trend seen in the wider job market fewer people will seek to change jobs overall. This doesn rsquo t mean driver retention will be any less important for carriers in the coming year, but drivers may not have as many options to move to in the current economic and industry landscapes. Retailers will continue to operate leaner, bringing in less inventory and later nbsp Retailers will keep their inventory levels low and bring in goods closer to the holiday season. This trend is expected to continue because the holiday demand is not expected to be very strong. Even when demand increases in early 2024, retailers are likely to stick to this strategy, and carriers need to plan for it. Efficiency will be the key to carriers having a happy new year nbsp If the holidays and early 2024 will bring continued lack of demand, cost volatility and market contractions, then operational efficiency will continue to be critical moving forward. Using technology and solutions that optimize fleet management, spend management, and safety will help carriers maximize their bottom lines, making them as profitable and productive as possible in the current environment.

            "Unraveling hidden fees, poor customer service, and inefficient operations. nbsp For businesses that rely on fleet and asset management, fleet cards have become indispensable tools to stabilize expenses against variable costs, like fuel. However, not all fleet card providers are created equal. Many businesses that have been using Wex, Comdata, AtoB, and other similar providers are discovering that the grass may be greener with a better expense management platform. 1. Hidden fees The silent profit erosion One of the biggest gripes among fleet operators is the presence of hidden fees that often go unnoticed until they balloon into significant expenses. These fees may include transaction fees, maintenance fees, even hidden surcharges imposed on certain transactions. Despite claiming transparency, some fleet card providers often fail to disclose these charges upfront or bury them in lengthy terms of use contracts, leading to unpleasant surprises on monthly statements. Switching to a different fleet card provider that prioritizes fee transparency can help businesses regain control of their expenses. See the hidden fees common fleet card providers may charge gt 2. Poor customer service The frustration that keeps your drivers off the road Customer service can leave many drivers frustrated when their cards stop working at the pump, while managers may face frustration around card replacements, reporting and reporting fraud. Unfortunately, many users of certain fleet card providers report subpar customer service, with some providers even charging fees for these services. Long wait times, unresponsive representatives, and trouble resolving issues can lead to unnecessary downtime and added stress for fleet operators and drivers alike. Switching to a provider with a reputation for excellent customer service can ensure that any potential issues are addressed promptly, enabling smoother operations and improved peace of mind. 3. Limited acceptance Restricted discount networks and partners Some fleet card providers have limited acceptance networks, meaning that drivers may face restrictions on where they can refuel or make purchases imposed by their providers. This lack of acceptance can prevent fleet operators from optimizing routes and lead to additional fuel expenses. Switching to a fleet card provider with a broad acceptance network that routes to the best discounts ensures that drivers can refuel at a wide range of locations, maximizing convenience and efficiency. Beyond just fuel, fleet managers should consider fleet cards that address their most costly expenses. Things like maintenance services and parts, tires, fuel inefficiencies, and in-store discounts on food and drink. Explore the Motive Card discount partner network gt 4. Inflexible features Capabilities that don rsquo t suit your business Every fleet is unique, and fleet card providers should offer customizable features that cater to specific business requirements. Some providers, however, have rigid features that can rsquo t be customized. Switching to a provider that offers flexibility in setting spending limits, access controls, fraud detection, and reporting options allows fleet managers to tailor their fleet card program to meet these needs. nbsp Furthermore, fleet card providers may only address expense management while ignoring the full transparency provided when combining your financial and fleet operations, all-in-one platform . Subpar integrations from fleet providers into existing fleet management platforms can leave fleet managers with a limited view on saving opportunities that reach beyond fuel discounts. 5. Outdated technology The roadblock to efficient operations The fleet management landscape is continuously evolving, and advancements in technology are reshaping the industry. Some fleet card providers may lag behind in adopting new technologies, leaving businesses without access to modern tools that enhance fleet management. nbsp By switching to a provider that embraces innovation, businesses can leverage advanced capabilities. For example, they can manage spend in the same platform as their fleet. Through precise fraud identification, they can protect cardholders from scammers, and streamline fuel and operational efficiency through automation. nbsp Switching fleet card providers can be a strategic move that addresses common complaints such as hidden fees, poor customer service, limited acceptance, inflexible features, and outdated technology. By choosing a provider that prioritizes transparency, customer support, and innovation, fleet managers can gain better control over expenses, optimize operations, and focus on what truly matters ndash ensuring that their fleet runs efficiently. Before making the switch, it s essential to conduct thorough research, compare different providers, and read user reviews to ensure a seamless transition. Investing time in finding the right fleet card partner can be a game-changer, unlocking the full potential of your operations. If you rsquo re ready to give up manual IFTA reporting, protect your bottom line with automated fraud detection, and easily identify savings opportunities, consider the Motive Card. You deserve a better way of doing business with a partner that provides full visibility into your fleet and financial operations, all-in-one platform. Learn about the Motive Card gt\n",

            "Get ready for the California ELD mandate set to take effect on January 1, 2024. Discover the key differences from the federal ELD rules, exemptions, and what it means for transportation businesses.\n",
            "It rsquo s been six years since the ELD mandate went into effect for trucking companies engaged in interstate commerce. Now California is poised to become one of the last states to enforce ELD requirements for drivers who operate under intrastate regulations. Expected to take effect January 1, 2024 , California ELD rules mostly align with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration rsquo s FMCSA rsquo s existing mandate. Drivers who are required to keep a logbook in accordance with hours of service rules must do so using an electronic logging device listed on the FMCSA list of self-certified ELDs , with a few key departures from FMCSA rules. nbsp nbsp What to know about the California ELD mandate Like the federal ELD rules, California didn rsquo t alter its hours of service rules , only those governing how hours of service are recorded. With that said, there are some important differences between the two rule sets. For example There is no 30-minute rest break requirement for California intrastate operators California drivers have the flexibility to drive 12 of 16 on-duty hours, instead of 11 hours. Learn more about the California 16-hour rule . California also applies different standards to specialty operators like school bus drivers, tankers hauling flammable liquid, and those hauling freight for the motion picture industry. All of this makes for a challenging compliance picture. Carriers are encouraged to review the rules to confirm California ELD compliance. nbsp Is ELD mandatory in California? The California ELD Mandate is under review at the Office of Administrative Law. It rsquo s expected to be finalized soon, and intrastate motor carriers can expect a smooth rollout come January 1. The California Highway Patrol has been enforcing ELD rules on interstate drivers since 2017 when the federal mandate began. With valuable enforcement experience under their belts, California officers will be well prepared to issue violations when the California ELD mandate becomes effective. Transportation businesses should be prepared for the changes as well. Fortunately, intrastate operators new to using ELDs can learn from their peers, many of whom learned the hard way in 2017, when they received violations during roadside inspections. Common violations related to ELDs include The driver doesn rsquo t know how to transmit ELD data. The driver failed to present an ELD cab instruction card to the roadside enforcement officer. The driver doesn rsquo t have blank logbook pages in case of an ELD malfunction. The driver has been operating a vehicle with a malfunctioning ELD for more than 8 days. The ELD can rsquo t be viewed by roadside enforcement from outside the vehicle. nbsp Notable exemptions to the California ELD mandate There are a few exemptions to the California ELD mandate. They include The short-haul exemption California defines the short-haul exemption more narrowly than FMCSA. This is important because drivers operating under this exemption aren rsquo t required to maintain a logbook, and therefore an ELD, to prove hours of service compliance. nbsp In California, physical operations businesses conducting intrastate commerce exclusively can use the short-haul exemption, provided that the driver stays within a 100-air-mile radius and is released from duty within 12 hours of coming on duty. Under FMCSA rules, drivers operating within 150 air miles from their normal work-reporting location and released from duty within 14 hours of coming on duty can use the exemption. nbsp Logbook exemptions As with the federal mandate, a California intrastate driver who isn rsquo t required to keep a logbook for more than eight days within a 30-day period won rsquo t be required to adopt ELDs. Similarly, drivers operating in a driveaway-towaway operation and those operating a CMV manufactured before model year 2000 or manufactured in model year 2000 or later but with an engine replacement prior to model year 2000 are also exempt from California rsquo s regulation. nbsp Conclusion With the expected implementation date of January 1 fast approaching, California transportation businesses slow to comply with the California ELD Mandate may soon find themselves accruing unnecessary violations and attracting unwanted attention from law enforcement. That rsquo s a fate all motor carriers would like to avoid. nbsp As carriers work to adopt electronic logging devices in anticipation of the upcoming implementation date, a few key considerations should be noted. Many ELDs can be more than just devices to monitor hours of service. Many also come with back-office compliance and reporting functionality that can create new efficiencies and unlock additional data to drive compliance. Be sure to work with your chosen ELD provider o get the most out of your ELD. ELDs can be useful tools, even for drivers not required to use them to monitor hours of service , like those operating within a 150-air-mile radius. Adopting ELDs provides new layers of compliance management while providing additional visibility into fleet operations. Just because a driver isn rsquo t required to use an ELD doesn rsquo t mean he or she can rsquo t benefit from the technology. Start assessing your ELD options now. Adopting ELDs is more than just flipping a switch. Devices needed to be procured and installed and drivers and management need to be trained on how to properly use ELDs to maintain compliance and unlock their full value.

            "The Motive AI Dashcam has earned recognition for its exceptional accuracy in detecting unsafe driving behaviors. Studies by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute and Strategy Analytics show that the Motive AI Dashcam significantly outperforms competitors, detecting unsafe driving behavior 3x to 4x more accurately. For organizations, that leads to reduced risk and fewer accidents. Motive s industry-leading AI is the result of an exceptional machine learning engineering team and superior AI Dashcam hardware . But equally important is the Motive Safety Team, made up of 400 safety experts who watch every safety event video generated by the AI Dashcam to remove false positives and improve the performance of our AI models. This unique combination of cutting-edge technology and human insights from our Safety Team is why Motive leads the industry in unsafe behavior detection and accident prevention. This concept of human in the loop event review is unique to Motive, included for all customers at no additional cost, and absolutely critical to running a successful safety program. 1. Eliminating false positives No AI model is perfect, of course. While Motive detects 15 safety events with up to 99 accuracy , this means AI may sometimes inaccurately flag safe situations as risks, resulting in false positives. Unfortunately, false positives have real consequences, causing drivers to be punished for mistakes they didn t make. For a deeper understanding of the impact false positives have in the industry and why rooting them out is so critical, consider this Vice article that shows what happens when technology falls short. nbsp The Motive Safety Team ensures that safety managers are able to focus exclusively on what matters nbsp genuine safety concerns, not false positives. In only notifying managers of the most consequential safety events, the Motive Safety Team helps to safeguard the integrity of fleet operations and drivers themselves. And that s not the only benefit. Safety managers using other dash cam providers may spend nearly 10 hours a week reviewing false positives or watching videos with no coachable unsafe behavior. It s a significant waste of valuable time. nbsp Thanks to the dedicated work of the Motive Safety Team, Motive customers spend zero time watching false safety event videos. The team reviews every single safety video, removing any false positives. This ensures that only true safety events make it to the safety manager s dashboard, allowing managers to focus solely on the most pressing issues that deserve their attention. nbsp Let s take a look at some false positives removed by the Motive Safety Team. 2. Improving the accuracy of our AI models The accuracy of our AI models owes much to the Motive Safety Team s meticulous work in eliminating false positives and classifying videos. Our experts label every video, capturing as many uncommon, real-world scenarios as possible to continuously train and improve our models. By noting details like time of day, road type, and weather conditions, the team provides valuable insight into how well our models perform in different situations. nbsp It s important to note that increasing AI accuracy from 97 to 98 is much harder than moving from 80 to 90 , as it involves training the model on less frequent, more unique, real-world scenarios. The Motive Safety Team plays a pivotal role in our validation process, curating thousands of uncommon scenarios to refine each model. The Safety Team s insight into behavior frequency and model precision help the R amp D team prioritize the most critical scenarios. For example, through this process, we ve improved the performance of our close following model in low light and curved road scenarios. This continuous feedback loop not only improves our ability to predict risk, but also ensures that regular AI enhancements are deployed every few weeks, maintaining our leadership position in the industry. 3. Best-in-class collision detection Motive can proactively identify 99 of high-severity collisions and get video footage to safety managers in seconds, thanks to the Motive Safety Team. No other vendor can claim this. We re able to accurately capture such a high number of accidents because, for every real accident, we consider over 100 potential crashes. To ensure that we don t miss anything critical, we cast a broad net. The Motive Safety Team watches every video and filters out false positives. Managers only see the real accidents just 1 of what the team evaluates. Our AI model, trained on 10,000 collisions, is regularly updated for better accuracy. Importantly, you almost never have to go and manually pull accident footage through our Video Recall feature. We bring it to you. Safety managers are alerted immediately with video and automatic collision reports, allowing them to quickly share the footage with drivers for roadside exoneration. Let s take a look at some possible collisions identified by the Motive Safety Team. Full-stack driver safety solution Motive has taken a full-stack approach to AI-powered driver safety . Our foundation lies in exceptional engineering across hardware, software, and machine learning. But without expert human training, AI isn t accurate and can t deliver real value.

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the November 2023 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the November edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report, where we analyze the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform during the past month. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Big picture Despite a surge in visits from the top 50 retailers, the trucking market is still contracting amid the ongoing uncertainty of 2023. Expect increased turbulence in Q1 2024 with a shrinking freight market and rising consumer prices. Consumer prices have remained relatively stable, even with the overall increase in diesel prices in 2023 due to excess capacity. But that may change soon. Carrier starts and exits continue to show a market contraction that will likely persist into 2024 until demand and capacity are more balanced. Retail trucking visits saw significant jumps in October, closing much of the gap compared to 2022 as top retailers start to normalize their restocking efforts leading up to the holidays. Leaders must plan for uncertainties by assessing cost structures and creating realistic contingency plans for their company rsquo s best-, mid-, and worst-case scenarios. Carriers must prioritize efficiency and reduce wasteful efforts as market rebalancing continues 2023 has been a year of uncertainty, but there were not many major shifts in the trucking market. That may change as early as Q1 2024, as the supply of trucking capacity goes down and becomes more balanced with demand for goods. This means businesses need to start thinking now about what their operational priorities are, where efficiency can be improved, and how wasteful efforts or spending can be eliminated. Visibility into fleet operations, spend management, equipment health, and safety will be critical to making these determinations, which will allow business owners to be prepared for these shifts in the trucking market and wider economy. Will diesel price increases affect consumers? Diesel is one of the biggest expenses for carriers, but right now it isn rsquo t a cost carriers can pass to retailers or consumers to maintain their thinning profit margins. Excess trucking capacity compared to demand for goods means freight prices haven rsquo t been able to rise to make up the difference. However, as carriers exit the market and trucking capacity falls to a level that rsquo s more balanced with demand, these costs will be easier to include in freight prices. That will likely mean higher prices for consumers. Carriers keep exiting the market, while new registrations hit lowest level since June 2020 nbsp nbsp 3,168 carriers left the trucking market in October, keeping pace with the average for 2023. Simultaneously, registrations for new carriers dropped 7.5 month over month, hitting their lowest levels of 2023 mdash and since the peak of the pandemic in June 2020. nbsp We anticipate these trends to continue through December and into Q1. December and January will likely see more carriers closing as smaller businesses decide not to continue into the new year under the current market conditions. While carrier registrations might see a slight bump, which is typical for the start of the year, the lack of consumer demand is likely to make this continue trending downward as well. Trucking capacity needs to be more balanced with demand for freight prices to rise and market conditions to change. Big Box Retail Index jumps as larger retailer inventory management normalizes Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index, which observes trucking visits to warehouses for the top 50 retailers in the US, jumped by 7.6 points in October. Retailers that sell durable goods such as larger appliances or furniture saw an even bigger rise of 8.6 points compared to September. The top 50 retailers are now down just 4 from 2022 levels of activity, a significant improvement from the 15 year-over-year decline seen in June. Notably, this spike occurred in the second and third weeks of October, as a result of Amazon Prime Day and competing discounting efforts from other retailers. What does this represent? It rsquo s likely that instead of indicating overall higher demand, large retailers are returning to more normal inventory management. They rsquo re bringing in more stock as the holidays approach compared to the tighter stocking windows we rsquo ve seen this year. Overall, we maintain our prediction that November will see retail visits exceed those from 2022. How to secure your business and plan for uncertainties nbsp Transportation, retail, and logistics leaders can focus on enhancing operational efficiency by gaining visibility into major cost areas, such as fuel spend and fleet operations. This is true for every business, but especially for the freight market as it heads into another uncertain year and continues working through the complexities brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Plan for uncertainties by assessing cost structures and creating realistic contingency plans for your company rsquo s best, most likely, and worst-case scenarios. A key element of this is proactively identifying areas to improve efficiency. This can include leveraging cost visibility platforms and conducting software audits to eliminate wasteful spend that is not serving your customers. nbsp Data Methodology The Motive Monthly Economic Report uses aggregated and anonymized insights from the Motive network, as well as publicly available government data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, U.S. Census, and U.S. Department of Transportation.\n",

            "Discover the transformative impact of the upcoming 2024 ELD mandate on California s intrastate trucking sector.\n",
            "In recent years, the trucking industry has witnessed significant regulatory changes, and one of the most anticipated developments is the introduction of electronic logging devices ELDs in California s intrastate trucking sector in 2024. nbsp This transformation is set to bring about a myriad of changes and challenges that will reshape the way trucking companies operate within the state. In this comprehensive article, we delve into the implications of ELD implementation on California s intrastate trucking industry and how it will impact businesses, drivers, and the overall logistics landscape. Understanding the ELD Mandate Before we delve into the specifics of how ELDs will affect the intrastate trucking industry in California, let s first gain a clear understanding of what ELDs are and why they have become a focal point in the transportation sector. What are electronic logging devices ELDs ? Electronic logging devices, commonly referred to as ELDs, are digital tools designed to monitor and record a driver s hours of service HOS electronically. These devices are integrated with a vehicle s engine and are responsible for tracking driving time, rest breaks, and other crucial data. ELDs replace the traditional paper logbooks that drivers used to record their HOS, thereby enhancing accuracy and compliance. The California ELD Mandate - a closer look California has been at the forefront of adopting stringent regulations to improve road safety and compliance in the trucking industry. While the federal government implemented the ELD mandate for interstate trucking companies in 2017, California has extended this requirement to intrastate operations, with full enforcement set to begin in 2024. California ELD Requirements The CA ELD mandate encompasses several key requirements, including ELD Installation All commercial vehicles operating within California s intrastate boundaries will be required to have ELDs installed and functioning properly. Data Transfer ELDs must be capable of transferring data seamlessly to law enforcement authorities during inspections. HOS Compliance Drivers must adhere to California hours of service rules, as monitored by the ELDs, to prevent driver fatigue and improve road safety. Exemptions While the mandate applies to most intrastate operations, there are certain exemptions, such as the use of pre-2000 model-year trucks and short-haul operations. Implications for trucking companies The California intrastate ELD mandate will have a profound impact on trucking companies and how they manage their operations. Improved Compliance and Accountability California ELD requirements will ensure that drivers strictly adhere to HOS regulations . This will reduce instances of driver fatigue and enhance overall safety on California s roads. Trucking companies will benefit from reduced liability and improved compliance with state regulations. Operational Efficiency With real-time data on driver hours, trucking companies can optimize their operations more effectively. This means better route planning, reduced idle time, and improved fuel efficiency, ultimately leading to cost savings. Transition Costs While the long-term benefits are evident, there will be initial costs associated with the purchase and installation of ELDs. Trucking companies will need to invest in both the hardware and software required for compliance. Impact on truck drivers Truck drivers will experience significant changes in their day-to-day routines due to the implementation of ELDs. Adherence to Strict HOS Regulations To ensure California ELD compliance, drivers will need to strictly adhere to California hours of service HOS rules to avoid penalties and fines. This may require adjustments to their schedules and routines. Improved Record-Keeping The shift from paper logs to digital ELDs will streamline record-keeping for drivers, reducing administrative burdens and potential errors. Overall industry impact The broader trucking and logistics industry in California will also witness notable shifts as a result of the California ELD rules. Leveling the Playing Field With all intrastate carriers using ELDs, competition in the industry is likely to become more equitable. Smaller carriers will have access to the same tools for compliance and efficiency as larger counterparts. Potential Capacity Crunch In the initial stages of ELD implementation, there may be disruptions in capacity as companies adjust to the new regulations. This could affect supply chains and lead to potential delays in goods delivery. Conclusion The introduction of electronic logging devices in California s intrastate trucking industry in 2024 is a significant development that will impact trucking companies, drivers, and the overall logistics landscape. California ELD compliance will require many businesses to make changes to how they operate. While it brings about challenges and costs, it also promises improved compliance, safety, and operational efficiency in the long run. As we approach 2024, it is imperative for all stakeholders in the industry to prepare for this transformative change and leverage the benefits that ELDs can offer.

            "Learn insights from 1,000 physical operations leaders across 11 industries in the inaugural Physical Economy Outlook report.\n",
            "See what 1,000 physical operations leaders across 11 industries had to say about the challenges faced over the last year and the opportunities ahead. As 2023 winds down, we reflect on the challenges that physical economy leaders faced this year and map out the opportunities that lie ahead. If there was one thing leaders could count on in 2023, it was more uncertainty. Inflation was expected to subside, though it never did. The economy was stuck in neutral. And skilled labor remained elusive . nbsp Over the past year, we rsquo ve heard from customers who say they rsquo re overwhelmed and overworked. Labor, resources , and time have become increasingly scarce, and leaders are feeling the pressure . They need real solutions that help lift their burden, not an onslaught of data that adds to it. In surveying 1,000 physical economy leaders across 11 industries, including trucking and logistics, oil and gas, construction, field service, and more, we wanted to better understand the state of the physical economy and the 12-month outlook of the people we serve. The result of this effort mdash Motive rsquo s Physical Economy Outlook 2024 mdash presents the most quantifiable view to date of the challenges and opportunities facing leaders of the physical economy, as described in their own words. Challenges Rising costs were the biggest problem in 2023, yet far from the only one Nearly 60 of respondents said rising costs posed the biggest threat to their business over the last year, followed by an unstable economy, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions , and operational inefficiencies. Fraud also arose as a major theme, with 44 of leaders saying fraud is having a big financial impact on their business, even though they aren rsquo t sure how to find it. nbsp Leaders estimate that 19 of current fleet spend is lost to fraud or theft. It rsquo s even higher for industries like construction, where leaders estimate that 22 of their fleet spend is lost to fraud. As a result of these challenges, leaders report an average revenue loss of 867,634 mdash with businesses reporting average losses of over 1 million in trucking and logistics and oil and gas. That rsquo s an incredible amount of money when your business is operating on razor-thin margins, often due to variable costs such as fuel, maintenance, and insurance premiums. It highlights the immense pressure these leaders are under. Respondents told us ldquo I don rsquo t always know that my employees are safe or where my vehicles are. rdquo nbsp ldquo I struggle with the unpredictability and lack of software to manage and forecast the issues that arise. rdquo nbsp ldquo Our workload is insane and we can t retain workers at all. With the labor shortage, everyone else has to work 60 hour weeks. rdquo One thing is clear ndash leaders are lacking real-time visibility and a 360-degree view of their operations . Without visibility, they rsquo re working in the dark. With developments in artificial intelligence AI rapidly changing the way businesses operate , it rsquo s unfathomable to think that leaders are navigating so much complexity in the dark. But they are. About 42 of leaders said they lack a single view into their workers, vehicles, equipment, and fleet spend. More than 1 in 3 said they don t have the visibility to perform their jobs effectively. And many more said the sheer volume of tools being used makes data difficult to gather and track. Opportunities Leaders are betting on technology ndash especially AI ndash to transform their operations The top five opportunities for physical operations over the next 12 months include updated technology and software 33 , economic stability 31 , supply chain improvements 31 , increase in demand 30 , and operational efficiencies 29 . Amid economic uncertainty, a structurally constrained labor market, and fraud threats on the rise, leaders see technology as one of the only aspects of their operations that they can consistently control. Fully 80 of leaders agree that having a single, end-to-end solution to manage physical operations would make their job easier. ldquo One of our biggest issues was dealing with what we didn t know and what our previous system didn t tell us. In most cases, we found out about problems hours after they happened. We couldn t prevent issues or respond immediately. With AI, the game has changed. - Nick Oney, Fleet Director, Kendall-Xylem Leaders view AI as a game changer for their companies. Physical operations leaders, in particular, are counting on AI to help them keep tabs on assets and vehicles, make better use of resources, and make data-informed decisions. Seventy-six percent of leaders want to use AI to gain critical visibility across their physical operations. Twenty-five percent already are using AI, and 71 want to use generative AI. No matter how you look at it, physical operations leaders are embracing AI, with 69 recognizing its potential to positively impact their roles. Only 12 express concern about AI eliminating their jobs. Approximately one-third believe AI can help address the industry s labor gap.

            "In the market for an AI dash cam safety solution? Learn the questions you should ask when evaluation driver safety technologies.\n",
            "Introduction Safety management is not just a job it s a promise. It means understanding what s going on when your drivers hit the road, figuring out which drivers need attention, having proof for investigations when things go wrong, and guiding your fleet to be safer and more profitable. And that s just the beginning. These days, roads are becoming more dangerous, and the costs related to accidents are higher than ever. If you don t know what your drivers are up to in real time, reducing accidents and protecting your organization from losses becomes challenging. Physical operations leaders often turn to safety solutions that leverage dash cams powered by artificial intelligence AI for assistance. AI dash cams can enhance safety, spot risky driving behaviors, record video proof of safety events, and offer managers the visibility they need. Unfortunately, not all AI solutions deliver the accuracy you need, and products don rsquo t always measure up when you get them into your vehicles. To help you sift through the noise and find out what works before making an investment, we have compiled a list of questions to consider when evaluating AI dash cams. They can be bucketed into three categories nbsp People Process Technology This isn rsquo t meant to be a comprehensive list since every fleet has different needs but it rsquo s a good starting point as you evaluate different safety solutions. People Choose a partner, not just a vendor There are a lot of safety solutions from a variety of vendors to choose from. Whether your investment in, and subsequent rollout of, an AI-powered safety solution is successful depends on the support you receive before, during, and after deployment, so it is important to go with a company that will be your partner every step of the way. Does the vendor understand my business and its needs? Every business is different. Has the safety solution provider taken the time to learn about my unique needs? Are they just selling me dash cams or have they developed a comprehensive plan to address my pain points? Will the vendor help me install the hardware and train my employees? Depending on your fleet size, schedule, and other factors, installation can be a time-consuming, costly process if you don rsquo t have help. Ease of installation is a major differentiator. Even an extra 10 minutes per install can add up, especially for larger fleets. Will the vendor help install any hardware or do they have partnerships with experienced installers? Once the hardware is installed, your employees will need training. Is that left to you without guidance or will the vendor provide resources? What happens if something goes wrong? Choosing an AI-powered safety solution is a big investment. To ensure you get your money rsquo s worth, 24 7 support is critical. Can you get a hold of someone quickly if there rsquo s a hardware or software problem? Do you know who to call if you have a billing question? Good hardware is nothing without responsive support. VTTI put dash cams from Motive, Samsara, and Lytx to the test. Explore the results. Process nbsp Insights and best practices You have a hundred different things to worry about mdash researching best practices shouldn rsquo t be one of them. A vendor should not only provide world-class customer support but should also help ensure you are up to date with the latest industry trends and best practices. Does my vendor review my processes and make recommendations? There rsquo s always room for improvement but sometimes taking the time to analyze and optimize your operation is time you don rsquo t have. Will your vendor make recommendations to ensure you are getting the most out of your investment? Will they call out new regulations that affect your business? Are they producing educational content that will help me run my business more efficiently? Look for a safety solution provider that keeps track of your industry and develops content that helps you stay one step ahead. What is the process for reviewing video? Is there a team of human reviewers? Capturing loads of video is a given when it comes to dash cams. While AI should be analyzing and surfacing any critical incidents captured more on that later , having a team of human reviewers is a bonus to ensure you are not missing anything. Does the vendor employ a team of in-house experts who review dash cam footage? Is there a human failsafe in case the AI misses something important? Accurate AI can do amazing things but knowing a person is reviewing your footage provides peace of mind. Technology End-to-end platforms over point solutions Arguably the most important consideration is technology performance. Not all AI is created equally. Using an AI-powered safety solution that has accuracy issues can mean you don rsquo t have a clear picture of what rsquo s happening on the road. In fact, if your dash cam isn rsquo t detecting and alerting you of safety events in real time, you have an expensive video recording system that creates more problems than it solves. nbsp Furthermore, an AI safety solution needs to be powerful, customizable, and flexible enough to solve for your unique needs. Integations, feature release, product roadmap, and hardware performance should all be taken into consideration. And having a way to request improvements or functionality will ensure the product evolves as your business does. How accurate is the AI dash cam and is that accuracy independently verified? Accurate detection and alerting is critical when it comes to AI-powered safety solutions. Does the dash cam capture a variety of unsafe driving behaviors in real-world situations? Are drivers and managers alerted in real time? Are a vendor rsquo s performance numbers confirmed by reputable 3rd-party organizations? There are a lot of accuracy claims being thrown around but it rsquo s important to know what is true and what is just marketing. Can the dash cam connect to my existing systems? You probably use tools and software from several different vendors to run your business, so it rsquo s important that any new technology you bring on connects to your existing systems. Does the vendor have integrations with the solutions you currently use? Are there plans to expand integration offerings? Is the camera powerful enough to meet my needs? It rsquo s time to get technical. Processing power, connectivity, resolution, video clip length mdash these are all areas that should be evaluated when choosing an AI dash cam . Does the camera provide HD video? What rsquo s the resolution? How does the dash cam upload video? How long are the captured videos important to ensure you catch the lead-up and aftermath of an event ? How does the camera perform in low- or no-light conditions? Is it a front- or dual-facing camera? Can the solution help my drivers improve? Catching unsafe behaviors is one thing. Correcting those behaviors is the critical next step. Does the safety solution help coach drivers? Can drivers review video on their own and self-coach? Is there a way to benchmark driving performance, e.g., driver scoring? Having recordings of events is valuable but taking action to improve driver performance based on what is recorded should be included. Is the solution customizable? Too much data may be overwhelming and the most concerning driving behaviors may get lost in the shuffle. Does the safety solution allow you to narrow the focus to the behaviors that contribute the most risk? Once the most concerning behaviors are under better control, can you then expand your focus for overall safety success? Take your time Rolling out an AI-powered safety solution is a large investment that can improve safety and boost your bottom line. But getting it right is a must. The safety and protection of your team, the business they represent, and the communities on the roads all around them are at stake. Hopefully, this list gives you a framework to use when weighing your options. nbsp Motive is also here as a resource.

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the December 2023 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the December edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report, where we analyze the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform during the past month. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Big picture In November, retailers increased their inventories in anticipation of the holiday shopping season, while diesel prices continued to decline. Despite this, the trucking market contracted further, potentially influenced by seasonal factors. Though November had a slow start compared to last year, Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index saw trucking visits rise closer to 2022 levels. November rsquo s weekly average visits showed that the trend of delaying restocking nbsp has continued. nbsp Encouragingly, there s a positive trend in restocking for durable goods, with a notable 16-point increase nbsp from the beginning of October through November. Diesel prices dropped another 5 in the same period. Nevertheless, the market sustained its overall contraction observed throughout 2023, with seasonal pressures appearing to hinder new carrier starts and contribute to a rise in company closures. Every dollar saved is a dollar earned for these low-margin, capital-intensive businesses underscoring the significance of exercising control over controllable factors. Consider seasonal fluctuations in the right context Predicting the effects of holidays and seasonality in consumer and transportation demand can be deceptively complex. While we know the dates of demand-heavy holidays like Christmas, Chinese New Year, or Independence Day, the disruptions of the pandemic followed by the current freight recession have altered traditional patterns of ramping up inventories. As businesses finalize plans and projections for the coming year, they should reflect on how seasonality has changed and what might cause further change moving forward. For example, will businesses continue nbsp stocking inventories closer to these high-demand holidays? How will the current capacity in the trucking market affect rates around these high-demand times? While these can rsquo t be fully predicted, they should be included in a business rsquo s contingency plan to inform how businesses approach projections and operational flexibility. After a slow start to November, retail restocking moves closer to 2022 levels Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index, which observes trucking visits to warehouses for the top 50 retailers in the US, ended November down 3 compared to the same time last year. After a sharp dip from mid-October through the first week of November, warehouse visits rebounded heading into Thanksgiving. The rally in visits through November is more prominent when looking at durable goods such as appliances, electronics, furniture and other ldquo hard goods rdquo . The transportation of these items to retailer warehouses saw a 16-point increase from early October to the end of November. When comparing average activity for October and November, visits for companies focusing on durable goods were down 5.9 year-over-year, while those for focused on non-durable goods fell by 10.9 . Motive predicts that visits to the top 50 retailers will hit their peak this week and that the gap in visits between 2022 and 2023 will likely decrease further but remain marginally below 2022 levels. The market rsquo s contraction gets exacerbated by seasonal fluctuations, though diesel prices drop slightly nbsp The number of carriers exiting the trucking market jumped to 4,931 in November, a 55 increase compared to October. Simultaneously, new carrier registrations also declined, with 6,792 registrants representing a 9 drop since October and a 16 drop since the end of Q3. Both of these numbers represent the continued market contraction being compounded by typical seasonal changes. For example, Q4 has fewer working days and typically sees struggling carriers decide to exit by the end of the year, while many potential new entrants to the market decide to start up after the holidays. However, one market pressure that did ease for carriers in November was diesel prices, which saw a 5 drop from 4.40 to 4,18. While not as steep as the drop seen at the same time in 2022, prices are down nearly 50 cents year over year. How to learn from 2023 and take the reins in 2024 nbsp nbsp Motive rsquo s Physical Economy Outlook 2024 highlights that the biggest challenges leaders in the physical economy faced over the last 12 months were ones outside their control rising costs, economic instability, and labor shortages, to name some of the top examples. However, when discussing future opportunities, updating technology solutions and enhancing operational efficiency emerged as key priorities within leaders rsquo control. nbsp As we enter the new year, prioritizing practices such as enhancing driver safety, managing fleet expenses, preventing fraud, and ensuring the optimal functionality of vehicles, assets, and equipment becomes crucial. Recognizing that every dollar saved is a dollar earned for these low-margin, capital-intensive businesses underscores the significance of exercising control over controllable factors.

            "Physical economy leaders estimate that fraud accounts for 19 of fleet spending, on average. Learn how to minimize the effects of friendly fraud and keep bad actors out. It may have a catchy name, but there rsquo s nothing friendly about friendly fraud. It is fraud after all. Friendly fraud is committed by customers, employees, and others you think you can trust. And it could be costing your business a lot of money. More than 60 of merchants have reported an increase in friendly fraud since 2022, making it the second most common type of fraud today . And though the number of fraud reports recorded through the Federal Trade Commission rsquo s database has declined from 2.9 million to 2.4 million, the aggregate amount lost to scams has skyrocketed 44 to 8.8 billion . nbsp What can fleets do about this rising threat? We turned to fraud prevention expert Jeff Sakasegawa to find out. Having worked as a fraud analyst for Google, Facebook, Square, and now Persona , Sakasegawa shares how to recognize and stop friendly fraud before it ravages your fleet. What is friendly fraud? Friendly fraud is the abuse of corporate policies and procedures for personal financial gain. It often happens when an employee takes advantage of a lack of visibility at the company and makes a few purchases on the company card, for example. Other times, a customer might deny receiving a product or service , even though they did receive it. The customer rsquo s money is then refunded as a credit back to their account. ldquo People who engage in this type of fraud are usually in dire financial straits, rdquo Sakasegawa says. ldquo They rsquo re looking to get money back from a large corporation, based on the assumption that the business can afford to share the wealth. rdquo In the U.S., where providers want to protect their relationship with customers, they rsquo re hesitant to investigate these transactions. ldquo The money has to come from somewhere, and it usually comes from the merchant who processed the transaction, rdquo Sakasegawa says. Why friendly fraud is growing In 2023, Merchant Fraud Journal projected that chargebacks would cost merchants over 100 billion , with the average value of a chargeback 192. What rsquo s driving the rise in friendly fraud? A few factors. Workers believe they have no alternative. As inflationary pressure persists , friendly fraud is increasing. With less buying power, workers are looking for any form of financial relief. ldquo If it costs you twice as much to buy gas as it did last month, people will do whatever they can to make ends meet, rdquo Sakasegawa says. Some people feel that they rsquo re owed a treat, especially if they work long hours or don rsquo t feel valued. ldquo Their philosophy is lsquo I rsquo m so underpaid you wouldn rsquo t believe it, rsquo rdquo he says. ldquo They feel the least their employer could do is splurge on a treat here and there. It rsquo s this attitude of lsquo They can afford to give me 200 a month in gas. rsquo For some people, that makes a lot of sense. rdquo nbsp Businesses have done a great job of reducing the most hostile types of fraud. What remains is a larger percentage of friendly fraud. A surge in online activity in the last few years has caused a spike in fraud committed by customers. ldquo The more online transactions there are, the more opportunity there is for these kinds of disputes to occur, rdquo Sakasegawa says. Friendly fraud in transportation As friendly fraud grows, it rsquo s found a foothold in the transportation industry, where it often manifests as fuel fraud . Fuel stands among the top three fleet expenses , making it an easy target for operators looking to save a few bucks. To detect fuel fraud, physical operations leaders should beware of the following tactics. Fuel deceit With deception like this, employees may fill up their personal vehicles on the company card submit a fuel purchase that exceeds a vehicle rsquo s fuel tank capacity or pump fuel into a container for personal use, conveniently charging the business. nbsp ldquo In theory you should be purchasing only fuel, but who rsquo s to say you don rsquo t purchase a couple extra things for you and yours? rdquo Sakasegawa asks. ldquo Everyone rsquo s got a tool drawer in the garage, and your driver may want an extra wrench or screwdriver to add to the collection. Small purchases like this add up over time. As line items they rsquo re all too easy to miss. rdquo Sharing fuel cards Employees may share fuel cards with friends, colleagues, and family members, authorizing multiple pump purchases on a single account. Managers may presume that the fuel is going into a fleet vehicle, but it isn rsquo t always. Fuel type fraud This kind of fraud involves purchasing the wrong kind of fuel for the assigned vehicle mdash regular unleaded, for example, instead of diesel. When this happens, it could indicate that a purchase has been made for an unauthorized vehicle. How to minimize friendly fraud We recently surveyed 1,000 physical economy leaders in construction, oil and gas, and other industries . According to the results, respondents estimate that fraud accounts for 19 of fleet spending, and 40 of C-suite leaders expect fraud to be a major threat to their business in 2024. Nonetheless, a lack of visibility is making it tough for leaders to detect and prevent fraud. To gain visibility and control, it rsquo s best to invest in technologies designed specifically to protect against fraud. To reduce your exposure, Sakasegawa recommends the following. 1. Let employees know their purchases are being tracked. Whether it rsquo s a corporate credit card for managers or a fleet card for drivers, let your team know they rsquo ll have to account for their spending. nbsp When issuing a fleet card to a driver, give them a heads-up that they rsquo ll be responsible for every charge that goes to the card. Tell them the statement will be reviewed at the end of the month, and require receipts and invoices. nbsp ldquo When you create hoops that workers have to jump through to create fraud, it can be a strong deterrent, rdquo Sakasegawa says. 2. Use fleet cards with built-in spend controls. ldquo In the high-cost environment that we rsquo re in, limiting fleet spending is crucial, rdquo Sakasegawa says. ldquo Fraud scales quickly. It doesn rsquo t happen once and then stop. People will generally commit fraud until they are stopped. Having controls that automatically limit spending will curb fraudulent activity and protect the business. rdquo Tools like the Motive Fleet Card make it easy to reduce unauthorized spending. Fleet managers can Instantly control who uses the Motive Card and how they use it. nbsp Add spending limits. Improve security. Restrict card use to certain times and locations. And reduce unauthorized fuel spend. To proactively reduce misuse, the Motive Fleet Card requires drivers to unlock permissions using their smartphones instead of through a PIN number that can be shared. The Motive Card rsquo s Fraud Reduction feature instantly flags suspicious fueling activity based on vehicle location and spend data. Whenever vehicle location and spend data don rsquo t match, Motive instantly alerts managers to potential misuse. 3. Invest in AI-powered functionality that provides real-time visibility into fleet spend. A new Motive study conducted in partnership with Freightwaves shows that physical economy leaders still rely on outdated methods, such as manual tracking, to detect fraud. Many of them plan to leverage more advanced methods in the future. However, they rsquo d be wise to leverage these methods now. With real-time visibility into fleet spending, fraud becomes easier to see, measure, and stop. AI-powered functionality that alerts businesses to fraudulent spending in real time is invaluable today, when concerns about fraud keep leaders up at night. Motive s Physical Economy Outlook 2024 shows that 76 of physical economy leaders want to use AI to gain critical visibility across their operations. 38 of them value the potential of artificial intelligence AI to detect and prevent fraud. More than one-third plan to invest in physical operations software in the next 12 months. And 27 list theft or fraud as the biggest threat to their business over the last year. To address these concerns, Motive boosts fleet card security and reduces unauthorized spend by integrating spend management and fleet telematics data in a unified Integrated Operations Platform. As a result, managers can set up spend controls and detect fuel theft as it happens. The value of real-time protection like this cannot be overstated. ldquo Fraudsters tend to talk to each other and share what they learned, causing scams and financial losses to spread, rdquo Sakasegawa says. ldquo Having real-time visibility into illicit spending can prevent the spread of fraud and reduce its impacts. rdquo Protect your business from friendly fraud Learn how the Motive Fleet Card can deter theft, increase profitability, and maintain visibility into fuel spend, all while giving you discounts on fuel and maintenance at thousands of partner locations. About Persona Persona understands how important accurate detection and quick deterrence are in protecting your business from friendly fraud.

            "A former safety exec explains why consolidating to a single platform is still the best way forward. As the economy has slowed in the last few years, merger activity has too. Global M amp A value declined 44 in the first half of this year , and volume was down 37 . With a drop in mega-deals, executives are counting on mid-market transactions to drive transformation and growth. As CEOs look to prove they have a sound AI strategy , AI-based deals are a rare bright spot in the M amp A forecast. But even the best tech deals are no guarantee of success. After a merger, some leaders may treat tech integration as an afterthought. That would be a mistake when consolidation is critical to a deal rsquo s success . nbsp Victor Malchesky , a former VP of Safety for Swift Transportation, has seen technology integrations work, and the benefits that emerge when they do. In a conversation with Motive, Malchesky shows why integrating to a single integrated platform can be such a game changer for fleet operations. Why to integrate your tech stack To understand the value of integration, transportation businesses must understand what can happen when they don rsquo t integrate . For example, fleets may suffer from Lost data Reduced productivity Untimely feedback More accidents Higher costs Lower ROI Consolidating technologies on a single platform eliminates these problems and creates benefits like those below. More consistent results ldquo Southwest Airlines became successful because they had one type of plane and a consistent formula that worked, rdquo Malchesky notes. ldquo That wasn rsquo t a fluke. The lessons of consistency apply to commercial fleets on the road just as they do in the sky. rdquo Why consistency matters Having the uniformity of one system enables teams to work in the same environment and speak the same language. nbsp Where to start An integrated operations platform , like the one from Motive, lets businesses manage all their operations in one place. By accessing Driver Safety, Fleet Management, Spend Management, and Equipment Monitoring on a single platform, companies get the visibility and control they need to become safer, more productive, and more profitable. More buying power Having a unified operations platform allows businesses to fight for pricing based on their scale. If a small organization is coming into a larger one, for example, they rsquo re gaining buying power through the deal. As a larger organization, the value of the dollar will go farther on one platform. nbsp After an acquisition, consolidating technologies needs to be part of the big picture. Says Malchesky ldquo There has to be a time when the safety department comes together to learn what rsquo s being done and which technology investments make sense for the organization. rdquo Clean reports, clear understanding Safety thresholds and data interpretations are different from one system to the next. When Malchesky rolled out dash cameras for one fleet, for example, he tested two different vendors and the results weren t the same. One triggered an unsafe event, the other didn t . The benefit of clean reporting ldquo If you rsquo re working with two dash cam systems , inconsistency creates issues with driver coaching and coaching effectiveness, rdquo says Malchesky. ldquo When you rsquo re gathering data and trends, it rsquo s much easier to go to one system and get one report. When everyone rsquo s performance is measured the same, you rsquo ll get clean reports that show where opportunities exist and how to drive improvement. rdquo Tools like the Motive Coaching Dashboard streamline the coaching process, making it faster and more effective. The most relevant videos, speeding events, and coaching history are surfaced in one view, so managers can provide personalized, timely feedback. You rsquo ll see everything at a glance, including Drivers who need coaching The behaviors they need to be coached on Each driver rsquo s risk score Performance trends over time Having clear visibility into each of these metrics allows fleet managers to pinpoint areas of improvement and reward drivers as they grow. How to integrate your tech stack Integrating technologies is a strategic decision that requires years of planning and a firm understanding of where your program needs to go. By eliminating redundant roles and initiatives, companies can deliver products and services faster . While integration is important, it rsquo s not easy. Following the tips below will make it easier. Retain policies and roles that add value After a merger, some businesses may want to start fresh. As they clean house, processes that work get discarded with those that don rsquo t. ldquo When you rsquo re the one acquiring, it rsquo s easy to say, lsquo This is how we rsquo re going to do things now, rsquo rdquo Malchesky says. ldquo You tend to lose some of the good that made the company an attractive acquisition. Policies and procedures that could be learned from suddenly get lost. It rsquo s important to learn from the acquired business and understand what they do and how they do it. rdquo Show employees they have a voice After an acquisition, employees may feel uncertain. Do your best to make everyone feel represented. The ultimate goal is to make your new team that much more successful. ldquo Success will come more quickly when people from both sides come together to share ideas, rdquo Malchesky says. ldquo It doesn t matter which side of the deal you rsquo re on. Everybody should feel that they have a voice and the opportunity to share their expertise. rdquo Integrate technologies at a smart pace Plan for the long term It rsquo s never wise to shake things up on Day One. That level of disruption creates fear and distrust. The pace of integration is often dictated by contract terms anyway. ldquo Have some kind of roadmap that rsquo s been agreed upon, rdquo Malchesky notes. ldquo It should be a one- or two-year plan that addresses when specific changes will take place and what makes the most business sense. rdquo nbsp Why a roadmap is needed Not having a carefully planned roadmap leads to inefficiency and waste. If a fleet just bought brand new dash cams, for example, does it make sense to just throw them away? Or could they be resold? ldquo Take all of that into consideration, and have an agreed upon goal that brings your vision together, rdquo Malchesky says. ldquo Be able to picture what the final structure will look like. rdquo What rsquo s your consolidation plan? Do you have a consolidation plan? Motive can help. More than 120,000 companies use Motive to transform the safety , productivity, and profitability of their operations.

            "Ask professional drivers how they feel about dual-facing dash cams, and you may not get a positive response. But sentiment about dual-facing dash cams has changed the more that drivers have used them. Operators are starting to see that these cameras protect their livelihood and their reputation. A recent survey of Motive AI Dashcam customers showed that after implementing dual-facing AI Dashcams , respondents experienced driver turnover of less than 5 . In fact, businesses that use inward-facing cameras saw a 3 increase in driver retention after 75 weeks when benchmarked against road-facing dash cam users. This was true for fleets of all sizes. As dash cam acceptance grows, word is spreading about the ways inward-facing cameras support drivers. Here are some of the biggest ways that dual-facing dash cams are earning drivers trust. Protection from road rage and hit-and-runs If you think North American roads have gotten more dangerous, you re right. Deaths per million miles traveled have risen 18 since 2019 . Frequent speeding and a decline in enforcement are big reasons why. Officer resignations were up 47 last year compared to pre-pandemic 2019. Officer retirements rose 19 . In an environment like this, drivers need all the protection they can get nbsp and the AI Dashcam is quick to provide it. Motive s Quick Capture feature lets drivers instantly record the high-risk incidents around them. When drivers are cut off, boxed in, or worried about an aggressive driver, they can document the incident with the push of a button. Drivers can instantly share dash cam footage with their safety team, so the video can be used to exonerate drivers of wrongdoing or educate the team on best practices. When a collision does happen and drivers are the victims of a hit-and-run, safety managers get alerted automatically, letting them check on drivers and send help right away. That level of care can make drivers feel valued and earn their trust. Hear what operators like about AI Dashcams, in their own words. Exoneration Nobody likes to be wrongly accused, especially for something as consequential as an accident. For professionals who drive on the job, false claims can tarnish reputations and leave businesses on the hook for thousands of dollars . If a driver is falsely accused of causing an accident, dash cam video can instantly prove the operator s innocence . This is true whether fleets are using dual-facing or road-facing dash cams. nbsp With the Motive cameras, it took us about 17 seconds to understand what happened and exonerate our driver. Don Penepent, Concrete Division Manager at Tilcon nbsp The Motive AI Dashcam captures incidents in ultrawide, high-definition HD 1440p, leaving little doubt about what took place or who s liable. Since adopting dash cams, 80 of Motive customers surveyed have been exonerated for not-at-fault accidents . Recent data from the American Transportation Research Institute ATRI suggests that dual-facing dash cams exonerate drivers in more than half of insurance claims and nearly half of court cases . Professional development Over time, unsafe habits such as close following and distracted driving can easily become ingrained in drivers. Drivers may not even realize it s happening. AI fleet dash cams can improve these safety lapses in real-time, alerting operators to them as they arise. Unsafe driving behaviors get corrected before causing a crash, leading to fewer sit-downs with drivers after the fact. Driver approval of dual-facing dash cams is 19 higher when dash cams are used proactively , reflecting a preference for positive safety approaches over punitive ones. Dash cams facilitate continuous improvement As modern technology gives operators more autonomy, they re using this freedom to grow faster and smarter. Here s how they re approaching it. nbsp 1. Self-coaching through driver apps After every unsafe driving incident, modern driver apps like the one from Motive automatically deliver coaching tips to operators, allowing them to self-coach through their smartphones, without a manager s involvement. App-based coaching is fast and easy, empowering drivers to take control of their own growth on their own time. 2. Improving performance and morale Safer driving performance ensures better road safety, of course. It also boosts operators confidence. The longer drivers go without triggering an unsafe event, the more confident they ll become. nbsp A track record of fewer close calls and accidents creates opportunities for promotion, recognition, and peer respect, giving operators more pride in their work. 3. Using safety scores to track performance Driver safety scores serve as reliable tools for evaluating performance based on driving metrics cell phone use, speeding, and close following, for example . Beyond identifying areas for coaching, scorecards help managers recognize and reward drivers for improvement and excellence. Gamifying safety through scorecards sparks friendly competition among drivers, promoting a positive and collaborative environment that keeps teams engaged. Driver privacy When operators resist dual-facing dash cams, it s usually because they re concerned about losing their privacy . They don t often realize that some dash cams come equipped with features designed to protect their privacy . Driver Privacy Mode on the AI Dashcam, for example, gives drivers the option to disable the driver-facing camera while they re off duty. nbsp Admins can activate Driver Privacy Mode for a driver, a group, or the entire fleet. Motive can automatically enable Driver Privacy Mode when the engine is off or idling, so drivers can rest easy knowing that their private moments are just that private.

            "2023 was a busy year for the physical economy. Learn the new rules and proposed legislation that will go into effect in 2024 and beyond.\n",
            "The physical economy was in sharp focus for regulators and lawmakers around North America in 2023. State, provincial, and federal policymakers in the US and Canada spent the year addressing or attempting to address several issues that the businesses that power the physical economy have faced for years related to safety, operations, modernization, and sustainability. Their efforts yielded mixed results, prompted impassioned debates, and proposed interesting initiatives. Here rsquo s my take on some of the key developments we saw in 2023 and what we can expect to see in 2024 and beyond. Key takeaways Regulators rsquo efforts in mandating and incentivizing safety technology adoption were met with mixed reactions. nbsp Truck parking and its public safety impacts will finally be addressed with potential changes coming next year 2024 . Programs aimed at sustainability and modernization are going into effect soon, which are seen by some as models for other states and federal governments, and you may need to be ready. Speed limiters and automatic emergency braking AEB systems FMCSA rsquo s efforts at imposing a speed limiter requirement for commercial motor vehicles were met with a mixture of support and pushback from the trucking industry, with the ATA , CVSA , and safety groups voicing general support while OOIDA and some interested legislators in opposition. Bills in both the House and Senate were introduced to prohibit FMCSA from imposing this limit, though neither has seen much activity. nbsp Critics of the FMCSA proposal raise concerns about creating hazardous road conditions when trucks are unable to keep pace with passenger traffic. Proponents point out that a slower heavy truck is a safer heavy truck. FMCSA and NHTSA also explored a mandate for automatic emergency braking systems for commercial vehicles, a proposal that was met with a similarly mixed reaction. One thing rsquo s for sure The debates surrounding these safety technology mandates will continue into next year. Electronic logging devices ELDs Authorities in the US and Canada continue to consider changes to the functional requirements for ELDs. Forthcoming changes may include addressing the applicability of the ELD requirement, automatic duty status change functionalities, account configuration permissions, and ELD certification and removal procedures. Motive maintains close relationships with the decision-makers, stressing in our communications with them the importance of harmonizing functional requirements across the jurisdictions, avoiding stymying technological development, and ensuring that any changes they make closely consider the driver rsquo s and motor carrier rsquo s experience. nbsp Beyond Compliance A nearly forgotten congressional directive to FMCSA finally got the attention it deserves in 2023. The concept of Beyond Compliance emerged from a provision in a 2015 law, requiring FMCSA to identify ways to recognize motor carriers for going above and beyond existing safety requirements. In the years since, the agency has found it difficult to decide which tools and practices should be included in the calculus, and how motor carriers should be rewarded for employing them. nbsp In no small part due to Motive rsquo s consistent efforts, a coalition of influential stakeholders has emerged intending to help FMCSA meet Congress rsquo mandate by focusing on the technology and practices that have the greatest impact on road safety mdash AI-powered dash cams and driver coaching. Based on data within the Motive network, I can say with confidence that if every heavy truck were equipped with a Motive AI Dashcam and every motor carrier coached drivers on unsafe behaviors through Motive rsquo s coaching product, thousands of lives would be saved annually through the reduction of heavy truck accidents. nbsp The coalition members agree that motor carriers responsible for saving these lives should be recognized and rewarded by the FMCSA for furthering its mission to reduce commercial motor vehicle crashes early signs indicate that the agency is inclined to agree. I anticipate that we rsquo ll see meaningful movement on this important initiative in 2024. nbsp Truck parking and its impacts For years, industry and enforcement groups have been sounding the alarm on the lack of available safe parking options for commercial vehicles, not to mention the public safety risks it presents. By some estimates, there is only one parking space for every 11 trucks on the road. Some reports say the US is 40,000 spaces short of meeting the demand for safe parking for our nation rsquo s 3.5 million truck-driving professionals. nbsp In 2023, regulators and legislators got to work on addressing this problem. Using money specifically appropriated by Congress in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the USDOT announced numerous grants to states to build new parking facilities and improve existing facilities across the country. Legislative efforts continued with the bipartisan Truck Parking Safety Improvement Act, looking to allocate more than 750M over the next three years to commercial vehicle parking projects. nbsp In 2024, we can expect to see more of the same from regulators and legislators trying to ensure safe parking options for the trucking industry, and we should see fewer trucks parked on the berm or highway on-ramps. nbsp Modernization and sustainability While efforts to usher in the era of a clean and sustainable trucking industry are underway outside the Golden State, California still bears the standard. The Clean Truck Check Program is a new iteration of the California Air Resources Board CARB Heavy-Duty Inspection and Maintenance Program. nbsp With enforcement set to begin in January 2024, the new aspects of the program require most commercial vehicle owners whose vehicles operate in California at all to register with the CARB, pay an annual fee per vehicle, and submit test results to the CARB demonstrating that the vehicle meets the state rsquo s strict emissions standards. nbsp Another requirement, CARB rsquo s Advanced Clean Fleets rule adopted in April 2023, seeks to set the state rsquo s trucking industry on a path to becoming a zero-emissions industry by 2042. It requires fleets operating in California to use zero-emission vehicles to meet progressive thresholds. nbsp While the rule rsquo s first phase is slated to go into effect in January 2024, the California Trucking Association, with the support of many, is suing the CARB to prevent the rule from going into effect. Time will tell whether this effort will be successful. Still, we can be sure that 2024 will see continued regulatory activity trying to limit and ultimately eliminate the carbon footprint of the physical economy. nbsp Conclusion I will end it here by reiterating that 2023 had a lot going on with plenty that I didn rsquo t get to address in this piece including proposed changes to how FMCSA rsquo s safety scores SMS and safety fitness determinations work, changes to the DataQ and crash preventability challenge processes, and work going on related to autonomous vehicle regulation. 2024 promises to see as much or even more regulatory and legislative activity that will profoundly impact the physical economy. We will continue to monitor and influence regulatory and legislative developments that affect Motive and its customers. We look forward to continuing to build leading-edge technologies and providing the support that physical economy businesses need to be safer, more efficient, and more profitable in 2024 and beyond.\n",

Companies are increasingly choosing geographies like Mexico as a production hub, leading to a surge in freight flow from the country . This trend is driven by a growing demand for locally manufactured goods and a strategic shift in the supply chain as a result of the pandemic and international tension. East to remain healthier than the West The analysis of freight flows indicates a decline in volume from West Coast ports with a notable shift towards the East Coast. Adapting to these changing patterns will be essential for businesses in the upcoming year. Notably, in the second half of 2023, ports experienced a stronger return, similar to what we rsquo ve observed in inventory imports. AI to ease supply chain security challenges Freight theft continued to climb in the third quarter, with a 59 increase YoY across the United States and Canada , and tactics like strategic cargo theft up 430 . AI-powered asset tracking solutions are addressing these challenges by providing continuous visibility and monitoring to combat theft during transit. Deeper integration of AI and IoT in logistics The integration of AI and IoT is becoming a focal point for the physical economy as hardware costs come down and computer vision models advance. AI adoption will accelerate in 2024 ndash from addressing labor shortages to boosting visibility and road safety. Think monitoring cargo, detecting unsafe conditions around a vehicle, license plate reading in out of locations, facial recognition of workers on site, etc., AI is becoming critically important for managing physical operations . AI benchmarking will become a key focus Despite the upfront costs associated with AI investments, businesses are recognizing the long-term value and cost-effectiveness of AI-powered technologies. Benchmarking the quality and performance of AI technologies will be a significant trend in 2024 as everything around us is touting ldquo AI-enabled. rdquo It rsquo s critically important to understand that not all AI is created equal . This matters more in physical industries where workers and the public rsquo s lives are on the line . nbsp Benchmarking will need to become a stronger industry focus to determine real value and accuracy versus empty promises. Autonomous technology still a decade out While the promise of fully autonomous vehicles may take a decade to materialize, advancements in AI technologies, such as Computer Vision and Generative AI, are improving safety in the present . We ll see a shift toward AI as a copilot in 2024 versus AI as a replacement as many autonomous startups close up shop due to technology, risk, and regulation barriers while current AI camera solutions demonstrate real impact now . nbsp As we head into 2024, these insights may serve as a roadmap for physical operations leaders navigating the evolving landscape of logistics and our complex supply chain. By staying attuned to these trends, you can position your business to harness opportunities and overcome challenges in the year ahead.

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the January 2024 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the first Motive Monthly Economic Report of 2024! What follows is an analysis of the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform during the past month. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Big picture December brought a strong finish to retail warehouse visits and diesel prices continued to decline, but the trucking market rsquo s overall contraction persisted. Retail warehouse visits peaked in December, concluding at levels nearly identical to those of 2022. Diesel prices continued to fall and some experts are forecasting less price volatility in 2024. However, the trucking market continued to contract, with December seeing the highest levels of carrier exits and the lowest number of new carrier registrations in 2023. nbsp Motive predicts that while the freight market will continue to contract in early 2024, stability will come in the second half of the year. nbsp 2024 may give the freight market a sense of the ldquo new normal rdquo After three years of impacts from the pandemic and major external forces disrupting the freight market, 2024 may be the first time carriers will get a sense of what the new normal will look like. Retailers are re-stocking inventories again, potential interest rate cuts could mean better access to capital, and consumer demand could be less volatile if inflation keeps cooling . While we will likely continue to see overall contraction of the freight market, we expect that 2024 will be less volatile, creating more predictability in freight and inventory planning. nbsp Holiday retail surge brings highest traffic of the year to warehouses, while diesel prices continue to decline The December holiday shopping season saw the year rsquo s highest levels of trucking visits to warehouses for the top 50 retailers in the US, as measured by Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index. The index reached its peak at 96 during the first week of December and sustained a level less than 2 below that of 2022. Durable goods such as appliances, electronics, furniture, and other ldquo hard goods rdquo followed a similar pattern in peaking at 93.2, reflecting a 4.6 decrease compared to 2022. Various factors contribute to consumer demand, but the rebound in warehouse visits during Q4 suggests that retailers are experiencing increased stability and adjusting their inventories accordingly. While it rsquo s unlikely 2024 will mirror the trends of 2023 exactly, retailers might be gaining confidence in maintaining higher inventory levels, a shift from the destocking emphasis observed throughout much of the previous year. Meanwhile, diesel prices continued to fall in December, dropping 4 cents to 4.14 per gallon. Several experts are predicting that drivers in general should see lower average prices at the pump and less volatility in 2024. December marks the largest contraction in the trucking market in 2023, concluding a challenging year for the industry nbsp December saw the highest level of carrier exits in 2023, with an estimated 4,860 trucking companies exiting the market. This represents a 52 increase in closures, compared to the annual average of 3,203 seen throughout 2023. nbsp New carrier registrations also dropped for the fourth consecutive month, decreasing 4 month over month to 6,503. This latest decline marks an 18 year-over-year drop and a 43 decrease compared to December 2021 when consumer demand was at some of its highest levels. While some of this decline is due to seasonality as we noted in our December report , the year-end figures unequivocally conclude a challenging time for the trucking industry. However, it is worth noting that pre-pandemic in 2019 there were roughly 16,500 new carrier registrations, while 2023 saw 20.6 more registrations 20,700 . Motive rsquo s prediction While the freight market will continue to contract in early 2024, we will see stabilization in the second half of the year nbsp We rsquo ve previously shared that the freight market rsquo s contraction will continue into early 2024, and we continue to hold this view. Our data suggests that 2024 rsquo s freight market will continue to be depressed compared to the previous 24-month cycle. However, we also see signs that the market may stabilize in the second half of the year. Similar to how consumer demand has been falling in line with pre-pandemic 10-year projections, we anticipate that by the middle of 2024 freight capacity will have adjusted accordingly. As stability approaches, it is crucial for both carriers and retailers to vigilantly monitor trends affecting logistics and supply chains . Maintaining flexibility will be key to seizing opportunities in what is anticipated to be a less volatile market in 2024.

            "As economic headwinds blow into 2024, operational efficiency will help fleets survive mdash and thrive. As we step into the new year, physical economy leaders are taking stock of their challenges and setting new goals. Last year rsquo s hurdles mdash rising costs, economic instability, labor shortages, and supply chain disruption mdash have carried over into 2024. So has the freight recession. nbsp By now, the freight recession has lasted longer than many expected it to, driving small fleets out of business while causing significant headaches for larger ones. With a new year underway, 2024 is all about operational efficiency. Smart fleets realize that a dollar saved is a dollar earned . Those who can generate the most savings will be the ones to come out on top. As the freight recession continues, even small steps to optimize efficiency and cut costs will pay off. Key takeaways With low freight demand and the spot market struggling, fleets are left with too much capacity and a lot of stress. The freight recession and the contraction of the trucking market isn rsquo t expected to ease until the second half of the year, making operational efficiency imperative now. The fleets that come out ahead will automate processes, increase production, and work to achieve more with less. What rsquo s behind the freight recession? The freight recession appeared to be a ldquo detox rdquo from the pandemic rsquo s artificial demand highs, as e-commerce growth came into balance with pre-pandemic 10-year averages. As demand for delivery services slowed, the industry was left with empty trucks and fewer shipments to move. Carriers folded, the trucking industry became more concentrated, and competition intensified. Here rsquo s a closer look at what rsquo s driving the freight recession. 1. Travel has picked up Americans emerged from the pandemic with a renewed urge to travel. People became more active, and the high demand for goods tapered off. ldquo From 2020 to 2022, the trucking industry boomed, rdquo says Bob Costello , chief economist at American Trucking Associations . ldquo Now we re on the flip side of that. People are traveling. They re going to events, experiences, you name it. And while all of these things require truck movements, they require a lot fewer of them than when we invest heavily in goods. rdquo nbsp While retail sales initially got hit hard, they rsquo re rebounding now. Retail warehouse visits peaked in December , ending at levels nearly identical to those of 2022. 2. Sectors are contracting Trends in online and in-store retail sales, manufacturing, and housing starts all have a big influence on truck freight. Each of these sectors is contracting year over year. For businesses that operate in the physical economy, it rsquo s contributing to a tough environment. While housing fundamentals are strong, 30-year mortgages have gone from 3 to 7 over the last year, putting a damper on home sales and construction. 3. Costs are rising As costs for things like insurance, and collisions stay high, it rsquo s hindering fleet profitability. After wild fluctuations in 2023 , diesel costs are finally falling, down nearly 50 cents year over year. But filling up is still expensive . Commercial fleets are paying the price, and not just at the pump. As the general public spends to commute to work or drive the kids to soccer, people have less to spend on goods. Freight demand is lower as a result. ldquo All of this is having a big impact on fleet profitability, rdquo Costello says. 4. The spot market is struggling The spot market, where all the extra freight goes, has fallen 80 from its peak during the pandemic. There rsquo s little extra freight out there. ldquo For the last few years, fleets didn t have to worry about filling their trucks, rdquo Costello says. ldquo Now they re out there trying to drum up freight, align with shippers, and fill trucks and trailers. At the same time, there rsquo s downward pressure on rates, which is a challenge for a lot of fleets. rdquo Strategies for boosting fleet efficiency For physical economy businesses, the way forward is to improve efficiency, increase production, and gain visibility and control over fleet operations. Here are simple, straightforward steps you can take to not just get through the freight recession, but thrive through it. 1. Optimize equipment utilization When equipment breaks down, sits idle, or gets stolen, it results in lost time, money, and resources. Roughly 66 of construction professionals say they spend more than a quarter of their work hours waiting for work to be done, often because they rsquo re waiting for tools and equipment to arrive. Equipment theft alone costs the construction industry up to 1 billion annually , and energy and logistics businesses deal with many of the same issues. Fortunately, fleet technology gives physical economy businesses the real-time visibility they need to overcome financial losses and tracking issues. Today rsquo s solutions can show exactly where assets are situated at all times, making it easy to track their location, condition, and use in a single integrated platform . nbsp Through artificial intelligence AI and automation , fleet technologies can map out efficient routes, monitor and reduce fuel consumption, and cut down on dangerous driving behaviors known to shorten the life of equipment. nbsp 2. Reduce fraud and theft In Motive rsquo s Physical Economy Outlook 2024 , leaders estimate that 19 of current fleet spend is lost to fraud or theft. It rsquo s even higher in industries like construction 22 . As a result of these challenges, leaders report an average revenue loss of 867,634 mdash with average reported losses exceeding 1 million in trucking and logistics and oil and gas. Most operators rely on outdated methods, like manual tracking, to detect fraud . But manual tracking is unnecessary when automated platforms that integrate fleet and spend management offer the visibility and control leaders need to stop unauthorized fuel spend . With telematics-backed fraud detection, businesses are alerted to fraudulent activity in real time mdash before it becomes a problem. 3. Invest in AI Artificial intelligence AI is getting a lot of buzz right now, and with good reason. In construction, oil and gas, and trucking and logistics, AI has opened the door to efficiency and automation. Manual tasks such as load sourcing, pricing, invoicing, and recruitment are becoming relics of the past. Capabilities are advancing, and leaders are buying in. Motive rsquo s Physical Economy Outlook shows that 76 of leaders want to use AI to gain critical visibility across their operations. 74 say AI is crucial to reducing costs and increasing efficiency. And 73 agree that roads are safer with AI-enabled cameras. However leaders intend to use AI in 2024, one thing is clear They rsquo re excited about AI rsquo s potential and what it means for their business. 4. Focus on employee engagement and retention From 2022 to 2023, driver retention jumped 5 . Though overall churn remains a challenge, more drivers are staying put, particularly in industries like passenger transport, retail, and warehousing. Still, finding drivers isn rsquo t easy. As the labor shortage continues, retaining the operators you have is essential. To retain talent and minimize turnover, consider the following. Create a clear path to promotion. U.S. businesses lose 1 trillion every year to turnover. Simply replacing a single employee can cost between one-half and two times that person rsquo s annual salary. Clear advancement opportunities will attract top talent and help retain high performers. nbsp A LinkedIn survey shows that at the two-year mark, an employee who rsquo s made an internal move has a 20 greater chance of staying with the company than those who didn rsquo t have the same opportunity. The clearer you make the path to promotion, the easier it will be for employees to advance and stay. Establish a culture of learning. If operators are exhibiting lackluster performance, you don rsquo t have to let them go. Work with them to build their skills. Dash cam-based driver coaching is a great way to retain operators as they improve. Today rsquo s AI dash cams can coach drivers automatically, alerting them to road risks as they unfold, so operators can learn safer habits and prevent accidents in real time. nbsp Use driver safety scores to inspire improvement. Driver safety scores can help evaluate each driver rsquo s performance based on safety metrics such as speeding, hard braking, and close following. Evaluate performance by individual or team, and use the safety scores to encourage friendly competition among drivers. Post a top performers list, reward drivers for improvement, and most of all, have fun with it . nbsp 5. Use a fleet card to cut fuel spend With fuel costs averaging about 64 cents per mile , physical economy businesses are looking to contain their fuel spend in 2024. Fleet cards like the one from Motive help to save at the pump . Businesses can save as much as 0.20 per gallon at partner fuel stations such as Love rsquo s, TA, 7-Eleven, and Road Ranger with Motive Card. Cardholders can use the card to pay for purchases anywhere that Mastercard is accepted. And with competitive discounts and no hidden fees, savings can add up fast. The road to efficient operations starts here It rsquo s 2024. The time to improve your operations is now. To learn how Motive can enhance the efficiency of your business, get in touch .

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the February 2024 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the February edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report. What follows is an analysis of the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform during the past month. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Big picture Slower contraction and stable visits to retailer warehouses may indicate the trucking market is starting to improve Contraction in the trucking market slowed considerably in January, with 20 fewer carriers leaving the market and new carrier registrations rising 22 compared to December. nbsp Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index saw a slight increase 2 in visits to retailer warehouses, with those from grocery, superstore, and home improvement retailers seeing the biggest gains. February numbers will be a barometer of whether these trends hold further into 2024. Motive maintains its prediction that 2024 will see carrier numbers 10-20 above 2019 levels. Be ready to take advantage of the market rsquo s potential stabilization With the first month of the year behind us, the trucking market appears to be moving in a positive direction after a challenging end to the year. While much of 2023 focused on adapting to a challenging environment, businesses now may begin to see the opportunity to adapt to more positive changes like retailers restocking more inventory. Ensure that your business plans maintain the flexibility to take advantage of these by utilizing a fully integrated operations system and streamlining data. These will help maximize visibility around fleet performance and efficiency, increasing the ability to potentially rise to these opportunities. January brought lowest levels of contraction, most new registrations for trucking market since Fall 2023 nbsp The start of the year saw the trucking market rsquo s contraction slow significantly. 3,707 carriers exited the market in January, representing a 20 decrease compared to December. New carrier registrations simultaneously posted their best month since September, rising 22 month-over-month to 7,938. It is worth noting, however, that this number is down 26 year-over-year from January 2023. Seasonal trends are likely a factor in the improved January numbers, similar to how they drove elevated market contraction in December . Carriers that were waiting for the beginning of the year to jump into the market likely did so, while the uptick of those leaving ahead of 2024 predictably subsided once the year began. It will therefore be important to stay tuned for February numbers to see if the trend will hold. Retail warehouse visits hold steady post-holidays, with grocery, superstore, and home improvement seeing biggest gains Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index, which measures trucking visits to warehouses for the top 50 retailers in the US, ended January up 2 year-over-year, with a slower first two weeks giving way to a ramp-up later in January. nbsp nbsp Closer analysis of the retail data shows that almost all sectors saw year-over-year improvement. Grocery and superstore retailers saw a 14.8 increase compared to 2023, home improvement saw a 14 year-over-year rise, and warehouses for department stores, apparel, and electronics saw a 5.9 jump. Discount retailers and wholesalers saw a modest decrease in visits, 1.8 fewer year-over-year. Much of these increases can be attributed to the return of more steady re-stocking patterns compared to much of 2023. Retailers dealing with excessive inventory and uncertainty of consumer demand led to depressed visits last year. Through the first month of 2024, these issues seem to be at least somewhat abating. Meanwhile, diesel prices continued to fall in January, dropping 8 cents 2 to 4.06 per gallon. While experts have recently predicted less volatility in diesel prices this year, recent indicators of global stocks may point to a jump in prices in 2024. Motive rsquo s prediction 2024 carrier registrations will outpace those of 2019 by 10-20 as market continues to stabilize nbsp While January saw the trucking market rsquo s overall contraction continue, the comparison to this time last year coupled with retailers continuing with more traditional restocking efforts indicates we may be reaching a level of stabilization for the market as a whole. This is particularly true of new carrier registrations, which are 18.6 above January 2020. Motive maintains its expectation that the rate of these new entries into the market will continue, with 2024 numbers eventually outpacing those of 2019 by at least 10 .

            "Managing a fleet of hundreds or thousands of vehicles is complex. Doing it in the face of rising costs, economic uncertainty, and labor shortages is an invitation for disaster. To mitigate these challenges, enterprise fleets must have a proactive, strategic approach supported by the most advanced technology solutions. What rsquo s challenging enterprise fleets? Without complete visibility into on-the-road, on-site and back-office systems, enterprise leaders are unable to effectively track the operators, vehicles, and assets they rsquo re responsible for. A Motive survey of more than 1,000 physical economy leaders found that most physical operations leaders admit they lack the necessary visibility into their fleet to effectively do their job. It rsquo s preventing them from becoming as safe, productive, and profitable as their business requires. nbsp Why visibility is crucial for enterprise fleets Managing a large commercial fleet is a complex undertaking due to the intricacies and scale involved. Key challenges include coordinating logistics for efficient route optimization, schedule management, and vehicle assignment. Proactive maintenance and timely repairs are crucial to keeping the fleet in optimal condition, demanding meticulous oversight for routine schedules and unexpected breakdowns. nbsp Fuel management, driver management, regulatory compliance, technology integration, and other factors further contribute to the demanding nature of fleet management at a large scale. Addressing operational challenges requires a blend of logistical expertise, advanced technologies, regulatory adherence, and proactive strategies. In fleet operations, where anything can happen from moment to moment, inadequate visibility is a huge liability. It opens the door to accidents, false claims, fraud, and theft. Some enterprise leaders simply accept this lack of visibility as a necessary evil, as if complete visibility into fleet operations doesn rsquo t exist. But it does exist. And large fleets could be benefiting from it. Reactivity like this causes chaos and stress in large operations, potentially leading to accidents, inefficiency, and exorbitant costs. Hamstrung by supply and demand fluctuations, theft, and worker safety issues, large fleets struggle from these issues most. Do you have a visibility problem? Make your own assessment by answering these questions. Despite these challenges, technological advancements have enterprise leaders feeling optimistic about the year ahead. To make the most of tech opportunities, explore these options. Do you consolidate the tools in use? By consolidating tools, enterprises can simplify operations, cut costs, and enhance productivity through streamlined workflows. Moving to a more integrated system can seem daunting, but the benefits of having a cohesive, data-driven view of your entire operation are immense. It s about making a strategic shift toward efficiency, cost savings, and enhanced decision-making that can propel your fleet management into the future. Do you analyze data handling processes? Investigate how data is handled within the organization, focusing on potential silos and manual processes. nbsp Leveraging integrated data systems can significantly reduce decision-making time and increase operational agility by providing a single dashboard and unified view for critical metrics. nbsp With real-time visibility into issues as they arise, operators are empowered to take faster routes, cut fuel spend, prevent accidents, and be more productive. nbsp Have you invested in AI? Implementing AI not only automates routine tasks but also serves as a strategic tool for enhancing decision-making, improving safety measures , and driving significant cost savings. Enterprise leaders agree, with 76 saying they want to use AI to improve visibility across their physical operations. Be aware, however. Not all AI is created equal. It rsquo s critical to ensure that any AI solutions you consider provide accurate, real-time risk detection. Do you evaluate proactive vs. reactive approaches? A staggering 58 of enterprise leaders admit that reactive problem-solving consumes most of their time. To avoid inefficiency like this, assess the balance between proactive and reactive approaches. nbsp Determine the percentage of time spent on reactive problem-solving, especially in comparison to proactive management. nbsp Adopting analytical tools can transform reactive operations into proactive insights, allowing for preemptive issue resolution and optimization. Have you conducted a comprehensive visibility assessment? Eighty percent of enterprise leaders agree that having a single, unified platform to manage their operations would make their jobs easier, and 76 agree that a unified platform would help them anticipate issues before they happen. However, many leaders don rsquo t have one. nbsp To gain complete visibility and control, evaluate the current state of visibility into your workers, vehicles, assets, equipment, and spending. nbsp In conducting a structured visibility assessment, be sure to benchmark current operational metrics, identify visibility gaps, and evaluate the integration of AI-driven analytics for full oversight. Taking these steps will help you understand the existing visibility landscape, identify areas for improvement, and leverage AI to overcome challenges. Are your fleet solutions adaptable to meet ever-changing needs? Enterprise needs are always evolving, so your tech investments should be adaptable. nbsp Invest in a customized platform to track and manage a diverse fleet of vehicles, from trucks to vans, and adapt to various operational scales. nbsp During peak delivery periods, a customized platform will scale to ensure real-time tracking and efficient route management for thousands of shipments. Do your enterprise systems have effortless integration? Enterprises often operate with established systems for ERP, HR, and more. By integrating an automated platform with an existing ERP system, for example, you can enable seamless data flow, and improve operational visibility and decision-making across the enterprise. Do you have g uaranteed data security and industry compliance? nbsp Data security and compliance are non-negotiable for enterprises. Invest in solutions with robust security measures in place to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with industry regulations like the FDA s Electronic Records and Signatures rule. Do your operations have round-the-clock support? The complexity of enterprise operations requires dedicated, 24 7 support. Look for a provider that can offer this type of assistance, ensuring that any issues are promptly addressed to maintain continuous operations across all locations. The AI advantage Many fleet operators grapple with inefficiencies like route deviations, driver issues, unexpected maintenance, and compliance issues, all of which contribute to visibility gaps and operational setbacks. The pain of not having real-time insights can lead to massively delayed decisions, increased costs, and missed opportunities. By adopting AI, fleets can transform these pain points into competitive advantages. Real-time tracking and predictive analytics provide immediate, actionable insights, enabling operators to make informed decisions swiftly. This leads to optimized routes, fewer accidents, proactive maintenance, and streamlined compliance processes mdash turning operational challenges into seamless efficiency and a stronger bottom line. When you pivot from enduring the common pains of inefficient fleet management to proactively leveraging AI for immediate, positive outcomes, you rsquo ll set the foundation for sustained operational excellence and business growth.

            "Motive and Nirvana Insurance are partnering to offer upfront discounts on policy premiums and help protect your fleet against fraudulent claims.\n",
            "Since late 2022, we have been in a freight recession that appears to be continuing into 2024. nbsp In this post-pandemic landscape, people are buying fewer things, the supply chain is normalizing, and retailers are finding a new balance of inventory to match lower consumer demand. This has resulted in fewer goods being shipped and the trucking market contracting in the midst of excess capacity. Several major trucking firms rsquo adjusted net income fell between 22 and 69 in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Yet, trying times offer new opportunities for efficiency, cost savings, and more for the savvy fleet owner. Whether your business is small or large, there are several strategic maneuvers you can make to bolster your operations, insurance, and team. In fact, Motive has recently partnered with Nirvana Insurance to offer upfront discounts on your policy premiums and protect your fleet against fraudulent claims. With the winds of change upon us, here are six ways to reduce risk and maintain the best economic standing possible. 1. Transition to per-mile insurance nbsp Traditional insurance assumes that your fleet is operating between 80 to 100 capacity. You must pay this rate regardless of how many drivers you have on the road, and even if you downsize operations. nbsp But there is a smarter option modern insurance carriers take advantage of in-cab telematics technology that provides detailed, real-time data for hauls to offer better, more tailored rates. In this innovative insurance model , you only pay for coverage on actual mileage logged, without spending on coverage for parked trucks. 2. Invest in safety amp training To maximize getting the most out of your fleet amp telematics, you rsquo ll want to invest in safety and training for your fleet. If you rsquo re facing cutbacks, you rsquo ll need visibility into which driver behaviors are causing losses and which behaviors are worth highlighting. Focusing on the positive actions drivers are taking can help motivate other drivers to perform better on the road. nbsp Insurance carriers that use telematics to generate safety scores give insureds instant visibility into driver performance, including information on routes taken, rest patterns, speed, and occurrences of harsh braking amp turning. Fleet operators gain valuable insight into which unsafe driving behaviors are present within the fleet so they can implement specific training programs to help improve driver outcomes. 3. Prioritize maintenance nbsp It rsquo s easy to consider deferring maintenance in an attempt to save on costs in the short term. This year, though, many companies have seen an increase in more costly, unscheduled maintenance repairs because their vehicles are operating past scheduled service dates. nbsp Properly maintained trucks are easier to drive, less likely to have an accident, and their drivers are more likely to have a positive experience. When trucks are kept up-to-date , they use less fuel, have fewer breakdowns, and are more reliable. nbsp 4. Employ a fleet of newer power units nbsp Investing in newer vehicles has multiple benefits. On average, newer trucks have fewer accidents, are easier to maintain, require fewer repairs, and last longer than their older counterparts. Significant technological advancements in vehicle safety, collision avoidance, and lane departure have made these features much more standard in the last five years. nbsp 5. Utilize technology to demonstrate proof of safety nbsp Safety considerations are a top priority when potential customers are evaluating your operation. To retain existing customers and attract new ones, employ sophisticated in-cab technology that empowers your fleet to surpass safety expectations across the board. AI dash cams can alert drivers and managers to unsafe driving, adverse road conditions, or safety events like accidents ndash all in real time. And advanced telematics continuously provide sensor data on all vehicles, reporting on route logistics and factors such as how drivers are maneuvering lanes of traffic. nbsp A single dashboard view takes away the guesswork and gives operators a clear, true picture of their fleet rsquo s safety. When you can prove the high performance and safety of your entire fleet, you become very attractive to companies that are considering partnering with you. nbsp nbsp nbsp 6. Save on fuel Fuel makes up about 40 of a commercial fleet rsquo s total operating budget . And though fuel costs have dipped since 2022 rsquo s record high , fuel continues to be a top expense for commercial transportation businesses. Fortunately, there are fuel card options that offer significant discounts at stations across the country. Even a 5 savings over your fleet can add up. Bottom line This is an unsettling time for many owners and operators in the fleet industry, but there are multiple opportunities to take action and influence outcomes for your business.

            "Motive AI Dashcam detects 99 of severe collisions, aiding prompt response, and reducing accident-related costs by 30 . Explore now.\n",
            "The Motive AI Dashcam has earned recognition for its unmatched accuracy in detecting unsafe driving, contributing significantly to driver safety by helping reduce risk and accidents on the road. Accuracy is critical in the seconds after an accident too. Accidents carry steep costs mdash affecting people, property and reputation. Motive rsquo s AI swiftly detects 99 of the highest severity collisions and quickly delivers video footage to safety managers. This precise accident detection ensures that you can act fast to recover, maximizing the chances for a favorable outcome. Vital evidence is preserved, giving managers the essential data and insights to quickly help drivers and simplify the incident management process. The science behind 99 accuracy For every actual collision we detect, we ve also analyzed hundreds of events that could be crashes to ensure we don t miss anything. Unlike competitors that only factor in g-forces, Motive analyzes key telematic signals to pinpoint potential crashes, like how fast the vehicle is speeding up or slowing down, and the direction and speed it s rotating. These scenarios, along with their corresponding videos, are then uploaded for review by the Motive Safety Team . Over 400 safety experts carefully watch every video and filter out any false positives from the real incidents. Safety managers only see the real accidents just 1 of what the team evaluates. nbsp Our AI, trained on more than 10,000 real-world collisions, is regularly updated for better accuracy. The confidence in our 99 accuracy rate is backed by a rigorous analysis of missed collisions that were later flagged by support or recalled by customers. The challenge of replicating Motive s precision and speed Motive s precision in collision detection is hard to replicate. It s the result of our unique AI model development process, Motive Safety Team, robust dash cam hardware that captures footage even in catastrophic accidents, and over six years of award-winning, machine learning expertise. nbsp Our collision detection also leads the industry in speed when alerting managers. Our system prioritizes potential collision videos and uploads them within seconds, placing them at the front of the review queue for the Motive Safety Team, ahead of non-collision events. On average, within 60 seconds of a collision, the team has reviewed the video, confirmed the collision, and pushed the event to the Motive Dashboard triggering an email alert to managers. In contrast, competitors may take up to a full day to notify managers about a collision. In a recent Motive survey of customers with more than 100 vehicles, nearly half of those who switched from other providers reported that their old systems detected only 80 of collisions, leading to 59 incurring financial losses and 31 facing costs over 50,000. nbsp We did have a company that we were using beforehand that had what I would call dash cams, said Sam Watts, Safety Supervisor at Meiborg Inc. We wouldn t get notified with those. And when we would find out that hey, we did have a collision with something , we could go back and look at the dash cam, it only recorded like eight-second increments, and even those eight seconds were like grainy 1950 s film. Hear how Motive s accurate collision detection has helped Meiborg in the video below It s important to note that increasing AI accuracy from 98 to 99 is much harder than moving from 80 to 90 , as it involves training the model on less frequent, unique, real-world scenarios. The Motive Safety Team plays a pivotal role in our validation process, curating thousands of uncommon scenarios to refine the model. nbsp Complete coverage from major incidents to minor mishaps Motive offers comprehensive accident detection coverage, accurately capturing all levels of safety events, from high-severity incidents such as t-bones and rollovers to the more frequent, less severe scenarios like fender benders, sideswipes, or backup accidents at worksites. nbsp Let s take a look at some collisions identified by Motive A complete accident management solution At Motive, accuracy is more than a statistic it s vital for driver safety , ensuring swift response in emergencies and helping reduce legal and financial risks. Our system simplifies the post-accident process No longer do you need to manually retrieve accident footage or spend time reconstructing events. Our comprehensive accident management system proactively delivers what you need. We had a safety incident shortly after installing dash cams that would have taken us months to resolve without Motive, said Don Penepent, Concrete Division Manager at Tilcon . With the Motive cameras, it took us about 17 seconds to understand what happened and exonerate our driver. When an incident happens, safety managers receive instant alerts, accompanied by video and detailed automatic collision reports. These reports, crucial for understanding the accident, can be readily shared with insurance providers. Safety managers can also quickly share videos with drivers, providing essential evidence for roadside exoneration. nbsp And because we detect collisions so quickly and accurately, Motive is the first and only platform that connects you directly with first responders during severe collisions getting life-saving help to your drivers faster. Even in extreme collisions where power is lost, the AI Dashcam s battery backup ensures footage is saved. And because video is uploaded within seconds, it s captured even in the case of fire. Coming soon, collision walkthroughs in the Driver App will help ensure drivers properly document accidents in line with company policy. See Motive s accident management solution in action Since adopting Motive, customers report reducing accident-related costs by 30 , with 57 of customers saving time on insurance claim resolution.

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the March 2024 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the March edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report. What follows is an analysis of the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform during the past month. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Big picture February brings mixed results for market contraction and retail demand February brought mixed signals for the US freight market, as both new carrier registrations and carrier exits increased. Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index saw another 1.2 increase, with grocery, superstore, non-durables, and home improvement retailers seeing the biggest gains. We anticipate these trends will maintain in 2024, with home improvement, in particular, outperforming compared to last year. Mexican carriers importing US goods see significant growth as nearshoring continues to ramp up. Motive predicts that sustained consumer demand and improved spot rates will create a more carrier-friendly environment starting in Q3 2024. New carrier entries point to shifts in the trucking market be ready to take advantage of it The entrance of new carriers both from within the US and abroad into the trucking market in 2024 reveals a vastly changed landscape compared to 2019. Influenced by the global pandemic, the US economy has experienced fluctuations in demand as well as periods of growth, decline, and gradual recovery. New routes for importing goods into the US are emerging. Predicting future market dynamics can be challenging, but these shifts provide an opportunity for established carriers to navigate the recovering market. They can capitalize on promising trends such as the potential for increases in rates and demand, as well as prepare for challenges like rising operational costs. February presented a complex scenario for the US trucking market, as both new carrier registrations and carrier exits increase The industry saw a departure of more than 4,000 carriers, a 10.3 increase from the previous month. This is likely due to spot market prices remaining at unprecedented lows , which exacerbated business closures. Conversely, the month also saw a 9 increase in new carrier registrations, totaling 8,675, despite being 11 lower than the same period last year. This growth, building on January s positive trend, suggests a cautious optimism among new entrants. Analysts anticipate rate improvements throughout the year, which seems to be encouraging the steady rise in new carrier registrations. In February, visits to the top 50 retail warehouses saw a modest increase, with grocery, superstore, and home improvement categories experiencing a significant surge nbsp Top 50 retailer warehouses saw a 1.2 increase in trucking visits in February as retail demand across e-commerce and major brick-and-mortar stores tracked 2023 levels. While this week brought news of rising consumer prices , generally positive consumer sentiment appears to be driving sustained demand for big box retailers. nbsp Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index saw visits to warehouses for the top 50 retailers increase 1.2 in February as demand across e-commerce and major brick-and-mortar stores tracked 2023 levels. Sectors seeing significant surges included department stores, apparel and electronics 15.6 YoY , home improvement stores 14.6 YoY , and grocery and superstores 12.1 YoY . In contrast, discount retailers and wholesalers saw a steeper decrease compared to January 4.5 YoY . We anticipate these trends will maintain in 2024, with home improvement outperforming last year. Meanwhile, diesel prices reversed their recent decline, rising 3.1 month over month. In addition to international factors, recent weather-related disruptions and outages seem to have contributed to domestic production slowing and prices increasing. Mexican carriers importing US goods see significant growth as nearshoring continues to ramp up As Motive CEO Shoaib Makani recently noted, the trend of moving production away from Asia has gained momentum, with a focus on both offshoring and onshoring strategies. Mexican carriers importing US goods have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of this, as the number of vehicles registered for cross-border shipping grew by 14.3 and the average fleet size grew by 11.3 in 2023. The market rsquo s overall growth was 2.3 , compared to a US trucking market that saw a 6.6 contraction. As consumer demand recovers in 2024 and more carriers and retailers invest resources in and around Mexico, this trend shows no signs of slowing down. Companies will continue to look to production and logistics in Mexico as a hedge against challenges to intercontinental shipping such as ongoing international tensions . Motive rsquo s prediction Consumer demand and improvement in rates will create a more carrier-friendly market in 2H24 nbsp Motive predicts that by the second half of 2024, we will be in a more carrier-friendly environment. February data supported last month rsquo s prediction that 2024 carrier registrations would outpace pre-pandemic levels by 10-20 . Meanwhile, sustained consumer demand, normalized restocking patterns, and potential improvement in spot rates show further positive signals for the trucking market. We anticipate rates will have moved upward and consumer demand will keep its current pace in the second half of 2024, leading to fewer carrier exits in addition to the previously mentioned gains in net-new registrations. Data Methodology The Motive Monthly Economic Report uses aggregated and anonymized insights from the Motive network, as well as publicly available government data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, U.S. Census, and U.S. Department of Transportation.\n",

            "Vision 24, our inaugural Motive Innovation Summit, brought together business leaders, industry experts, Motive customers, and innovators. This incredible community came together to hone their skills, gain insights from each other on how they are addressing their biggest challenges, and learn about new Motive solutions that will make operations safer, more productive, and more profitable. nbsp If you couldn rsquo t join us in Nashville and want more information about our exciting product announcements, we ve added a recording of the opening keynote below. We rsquo ve also captured some of the highlights from Vision 24 a little later in this post. The new products we announced extend Motive rsquo s industry-leading AI to new safety and workplace applications, and give operations leaders visibility and control over more aspects of their business. This is a bit of a TL DR, but we rsquo ve been busy ndash here are the key product announcements from Vision 24 New AI Omnivision, the first and only customizable computer vision platform, gives customers across a wide range of industries more visibility than ever before. With AI Omnivision, our goal is to make sure you know everything happening in the field even when you are sitting back at the office. One-of-a-kind AI models that make the industry rsquo s most accurate AI even better, detecting more unsafe behaviors. We announced new AI models targeting drowsiness, lane swerving, and unsafe parking to protect drivers and other motorists. We also announced new forward collision warnings, sideswipe and blind spot monitoring, and positive behavior detection. First and only Driver Safety Solution with First Responder functionality to dispatch 911 in the event of a severe collision. With enhanced accident response capabilities, Motive can immediately alert emergency services and managers when a severe accident happens and quickly get help to drivers when they need it most. Shared data enables customers with Motive Fleet Management and Motive Card to reduce costs and detect hidden fraud. Motive Card rsquo s new Missed Savings feature will help ensure drivers get the best fuel price every time they fill up. We also announced new fraud detection capabilities, including vehicle and spend location mismatch, auto-decline, and mobile unlock. New Motive Beacon locates small assets and equipment in warehouses, on job sites, and in transit. We announced the Motive Beacon, a small but highly durable Bluetooth-based tracking device that will allow customers to track just about anything ndash from small tools and equipment on a worksite to pallets in a warehouse. New Integrated Coaching and Custom Walkthroughs give managers more ways to positively impact performance. Coaching has made an incredible impact on safety, new Integrated Coaching brings the same experience to fuel efficiency, compliance, and savings. Read on for more information on the exciting product innovations we announced at Vision 24! Expanding visibility around your operations with AI Omnivision In 2023, Motive launched AI Omnicam, the first AI-powered camera for side, rear, and cargo monitoring. When paired with the AI Dashcam, this technology provides 360-degree visibility around your vehicle. This year, we re building on the power of the AI Omnicam with a new product, AI Omnivision , the first and only customizable, general-purpose computer vision platform for physical operations. AI Omnivision is built to meet your specific operational needs. It enables the rapid development of precise, custom AI models to drive operational efficiency, enhance worksite and bystander safety, improve cargo security, and more. AI Omnivision will revolutionize how industries tackle some of their most pressing issues Waste services Sanitation workers grapple with dangerous objects, hazardous materials, and delays in collection. AI Omnivision can detect overflowing bins and hazardous materials to reduce risk while increasing revenue and efficiency. Construction Failing to follow proper safety procedures can contribute to worksite injuries and deaths. AI Omnivision detects and alerts to job site hazards, like failure to wear personal protective equipment PPE , ensuring that workers are protected. Trucking and logistics AI Omnivision can immediately detect and alert managers to unauthorized access to cargo. It can also ensure cargo is secure, monitor trailer space utilization, and provide proof of delivery. Passenger transportation Motive rsquo s AI Omnivision has the power to improve passenger safety and optimize routes. Use it to detect unsafe driving near a school bus or detect aggressive behavior, theft, and smoking. Oil and gas Safety is paramount at remote oil and gas worksites. AI Omnivision can verify the correct use of safety gear and ensure compliance with safety rules. All industries Large commercial vehicles have big blind spots, and they often have to navigate narrow streets, residential areas, and construction zones. AI Omnivision can alert drivers to the presence of pedestrians, cyclists, and others in their blind spots to prevent accidents. Enhancing driver safety with new industry-leading AI models Roadways are more dangerous than ever. Fleet operators are taking notice mdash and taking action with Motive. For more than seven years, Motive has pioneered the use of AI to detect unsafe driving behaviors with incredible accuracy. Last year, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute VTTI put the Motive AI Dashcam through nearly 400 tests on a closed track and found that Motive alerted drivers of unsafe driving 3-4x more accurately than competitors. More accurate AI means more accidents prevented and more lives saved. We rsquo re pushing the boundaries of Motive rsquo s AI even further in 2024, starting with tackling driver fatigue from multiple perspectives. nbsp Drowsiness Each year, driver fatigue contributes to about 100,000 vehicle-related accidents . Motive rsquo s AI helps prevent accidents by alerting drivers in real time if they yawn repeatedly, close their eyes, or show other signs of drowsiness, advising them to pull over if they can rsquo t stay awake. Lane Swerving For customers with only a road-facing AI Dashcam, swerving is a strong indicator of driver fatigue and inattentiveness. Motive rsquo s AI helps to prevent accidents by alerting drivers when the vehicle swerves repeatedly. Forward Collision Warning Rear-end crashes account for 29 of all crashes , but forward-collision warning systems reduce these crash rates by 27 . Motive rsquo s AI alerts drivers in real time when their vehicle is about to strike the vehicle ahead, based on vehicle speed and distance to impact. When drivers nod off, this alert wakes them in that last critical moment before a serious accident happens. Unsafe Parking Pulling over to the shoulder to rest increases the risk of high-speed collisions. Motive rsquo s AI helps prevent accidents by alerting drivers when the vehicle is parked on the shoulder for a prolonged period of time. Additional AI models will give you visibility into Red Light Violation s Smoking Positive Behaviors ndash Safe Distance Motive co-founder amp CEO Shoaib Makani highlights the accident-reduction results Motive customers have experienced. First Responder automatically contacts 911 in the event of a severe collision Although Motive aims to prevent as many accidents as possible, accidents do happen. Getting emergency help is often a matter of life or death, especially in remote areas or late at night. More than half 54 of fatal crashes involving large trucks are in rural areas, and 37 of fatal crashes take place at night, when it could take up to 19 minutes for help to arrive. nbsp Studies show that fatalities can be reduced by 13 for every minute rsquo s reduction in emergency response time. That rsquo s why Motive has become the first and only Driver Safety solution to offer automatic alerts to emergency services that include critical information such as driver and vehicle location, make and model, color, license plate, orientation, passengers, and other important information. Motive also alerts safety managers, who can choose to initiate the 911 call themselves. Once a call has been placed, managers can track the status of emergency services in the Motive Dashboard and Fleet App, providing real-time updates. Shared data gives customers with Motive Fleet Management and Motive Card unique tools to reduce costs and detect hidden fraud With fuel representing up to 40 of fleet costs, Motive understands the importance of saving as much fuel as possible. At Vision 24, we announced new ways to detect suspicious transactions and ensure your drivers are getting the best price on fuel every time they fill up. Missed Savings Using our integrated platform rsquo s 360 deg view of data, Motive Card will now give fleet managers visibility into wasteful spending habits by identifying drivers who are fueling at higher-priced merchants and recommending less costly alternatives nearby. Managers can use these insights to coach drivers, update spend profiles, or block specific merchants to avoid missing savings in the future. Fuel Level and Spend Mismatch Motive rsquo s automatic detection of irregularities between fuel purchased and the volume filled can detect and reduce behaviors like fuel siphoning. Auto-decline This new feature will help stop fraudulent transactions before they rsquo re completed. Managers can enable the feature to auto-decline Motive Card transactions when the vehicle location and spend location don rsquo t match. New Motive Beacon tracks small assets and equipment ndash no matter the location Physical operations leaders constantly struggle with tracking smaller pieces of equipment on outdoor job sites and inside warehouses, where traditional GPS tracking does not work reliably. This challenge results in billions of dollars worth of financial losses for retailers and construction firms from lost or stolen pallets and equipment, and employees often spend weeks searching for specific items. The Motive Beacon is a small but highly durable Bluetooth-based tracking device that will allow customers to track just about anything. The Motive Beacon connects to the Motive Beacon Gateway to enable meter-level indoor positioning and connects to the Motive Mesh Network to allow customers to track their equipment on the move. Site Visibility The Motive Beacon Gateway is designed specifically for asset positioning within a facility such as a warehouse, manufacturing plant, or construction site, where traditional GPS tracking is unreliable. By connecting Motive Beacons to the Motive Beacon Gateway, Motive creates a wireless technological net that enables workers to leverage the Motive Fleet App to lead them precisely to the asset they need. Remote Visibility Once an asset is in transit beyond the confines of a facility, the Motive Mesh Network leverages Motive rsquo s 2 million active Motive Vehicle Gateways, Asset Gateways, and Motive App users to locate these assets. This ensures that all assets are accounted for and significantly reduces the cost associated with lost inventory, which can amount to billions of dollars in delays and losses. New Integrated Coaching to uplevel all aspects of driver performance nbsp You want to be able to coach across every aspect of the driver rsquo s job. Their fuel efficiency, their compliance violations, and even their missed savings with Motive Card. With our new Integrated Coaching experience, managers get a centralized coaching workflow, tailored to the coaching thresholds you define across each behavior area. nbsp And with new Custom Walkthroughs , businesses can customize driver walkthrough lists, prompting actions at the beginning and end of assignments and critical trigger points to make sure tasks are completed consistently. nbsp We invite you to share in the vision Thank you for trusting Motive to be part of your journey. We extend our deepest gratitude to the dedicated vehicle and equipment operators within the physical economy. Your challenges inspire our solutions, and together, we rsquo re setting new standards for safety, productivity, and profitability. nbsp The advancements announced at Vision 24 are just the beginning of our unwavering commitment to transforming the logistics and transportation industry.

            "According to the National Safety Council , 44,450 people died in motor vehicle crashes in 2023, a 4 decline. It marks the second consecutive year road deaths have fallen for the general public. But not for commercial workers. For them, roads are getting more dangerous, not less so. nbsp Commercial transportation incidents account for nearly 40 of all worker deaths, and fatal crashes are up 18 . Despite these risks, Motive rsquo s State of Safety Report shows that 40 of physical economy leaders are underinvested in safety technology, believing improving safety is too big an expense. nbsp But costs add up faster in the absence of a fleet safety program. The typical fleet has a 20 yearly accident rate , and according to the National Safety Council, a fatal accident costs an average of 1.7 million when you factor in property damage, settlements, and legal fees. The larger the vehicle, the higher the costs. According to the FMCSA, the financial impact of a fatal collision involving a large commercial vehicle can be as high as 7 million per incident . nbsp Reducing accidents is the key to reducing costs As accidents increase, fleet insurance costs and nuclear verdicts often rise. The mean payment size in smaller verdicts and settlements hovers around 427,000 . When a fatality takes place or drivers have a history of unsafe driving, the average payout is substantially higher mdash 600,000 or more. Meanwhile, premium costs per mile have risen 47 in the last decade. The cost of doing business, and defending your business when accidents happen, is going up. By investing in fleet safety programs, businesses save in the long run. The State of Safety Report shows that 52 of large fleets saved over 10,000 after implementing a safety program. 20 saved over 100,000. 44 of organizations saved on insurance costs. 57 nbsp reduced unsafe driving through an AI-powered safety solution.

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the April 2024 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the April edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report. What follows is an analysis of the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform during the past month. Motive rsquo s transportation and logistics data is a reflection of consumer demand and therefore, a leading indicator of overall economic stability and trends. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Big picture Market contraction slows significantly as market pain appears to be easing March saw the trucking market trend in the right direction, as contraction slowed and new registrations surged to levels not seen since March 2023. Motive maintains its prediction that the market will continue to improve heading into Q3. Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index saw gains across all sectors, with visits to home improvement retailer warehouses seeing the most significant jump heading into Spring and Summer. Motive predicts this sector will close the year 25-30 ahead of 2023 Truck data shows traffic to the port of Baltimore remains depressed following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key bridge. Still, the accident s effects on the wider supply chain landscape will likely be moderate. Plan in the right context to avoid the mistakes of the past The trucking market continues to move in the right direction as contraction slows and demand remains high. It s important to clarify that this doesn t signify a booming market. Rather, it indicates progress in recovering from the longest and deepest downturn the trucking industry has experienced. Business owners must take these positive data points in the right context, and understand a return to the heights of 2022 is unlikely. Stubbornly high inflation and macroeconomic factors will continue to impact the market, and business owners should plan accordingly. nbsp Trucking market contraction slowed significantly in March, continues climbing out of record lows of 2022-23 53 fewer trucking firms totaling 1,827 exited the market in March, bringing the market rsquo s contraction to its lowest level in 12 months. New carrier registration also saw positive gains, as 9.1 more registrations 9,463 in total hit in March to mark the highest level in 12 months. Bolstered by continued gains in retail demand more on that below and stable consumer confidence , this marks a positive shift for carriers, who have experienced a historically long and deep market contraction following the pandemic. This data is consistent with our prediction that the market will be more carrier-friendly by the second half of 2024. Visits to the top 50 retail warehouses continue to climb, with gains seen across the board as restocking surges heading into Spring and Summer The trend of retailers restocking inventories showed no signs of slowing down in March. Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index saw truck visits to the warehouses of the top 50 US retailers jump 6.9 since February and 3.9 year-over-year. Looking at sectors across retail shows the first month of gains for everyone this year. Discount retailers and wholesalers saw their first increase of 2024 1.5 YoY , while department stores, electronics, and apparel saw another big surge 18.2 YoY . Grocery and superstores also saw a significant jump of 14.8 YoY, but it was home improvement that saw the biggest jump 20.5 . While some data suggested the home improvement market would contract in 2024, warehouse visits have steadily increased since the year began. We predict that this trend will continue, hitting its peak in early to mid-May and close out the year 25-30 higher than 2023. Baltimore bridge collapse response highlights new normal for supply chains Over the last few years, the transportation sector has dealt with major disruptions due to ldquo black swan events rdquo like the Suez Canal blockage, the pileup at the Port of Long Beach during the Covid surge, and the drying up of the Panama Canal last year. The Francis Scott Key bridge collapse in Baltimore marks the latest example, with a nearly 60 drop in trucks going to the port since the accident occurred. Much of this drop occurred in the three days following the accident, with traffic to the port remaining depressed as a result. The situation in Baltimore also shows that supply chains have had to become better at handling unexpected events like these out of necessity. The overall impact to wider US and global supply chains is likely to be moderate , as rail mitigation and other responses have been enacted to redirect shipping traffic to other ports. nbsp We expect most of the disruption will occur over Q2 before the impact is largely mitigated. Motive rsquo s prediction Consumer demand and improvement in rates will create a more carrier-friendly market in 2H24 nbsp Motive predicts a more carrier-friendly environment by the second half of 2024. February data supported last month rsquo s prediction that 2024 carrier registrations would outpace pre-pandemic levels by 10-20 . Meanwhile, sustained consumer demand, normalized restocking patterns, and potential improvement in spot rates show further positive signals for the trucking market. We anticipate rates will have moved upward and consumer demand will keep its current pace in the second half of 2024, leading to fewer carrier exits in addition to the previously mentioned gains in net-new registrations. nbsp Data Methodology The Motive Monthly Economic Report uses aggregated and anonymized insights from the Motive network, as well as publicly available government data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, U.S. Census, and U.S. Department of Transportation.\n",

            "With deadly accidents for commercial workers on the rise, learn how to leverage AI-powered technologies for better fleet safety.\n",
            "People who move the physical economy forward hold some of the most dangerous jobs in the world. They operate in intense heat and bitter cold, work atop buildings, and toil below ground. They weld and torch, jackhammer and drill, and push themselves to the brink every day. nbsp Whether you work in construction, oil and gas, manufacturing, or field services, lives are on the line. And transportation jobs are the most deadly of all. Of nearly 5,500 work-related deaths in 2022, more than 2,000 of them occurred in transportation incidents. In oil and gas, the statistics are even worse, with motor vehicle accidents accounting for more than half of all work-related deaths. While serious accidents have declined for the motoring public, they rsquo ve only risen for commercial workers. Nearly 6,000 large commercial vehicles were involved in fatal crashes in 2021, an 18 increase from the year before. As incidents continue to rise , new research shows that crash deaths in large vehicles have skyrocketed 75 since 2009. Key takeaways Deadly accidents for commercial workers are on the rise, though safety technology continues to be underutilized. While some businesses view safety investment as an added expense, the costs of inaction are often much higher. nbsp Fleets that utilize AI-enabled platforms report a decline in unsafe driving behaviors, leading to enhanced safety and reduced costs. nbsp Safety technology offers a way out of this epidemic, but Motive rsquo s State of Safety Report shows that many physical economy leaders are underinvested in safety technology, with 8 saying they rsquo re ldquo drastically underinvested. rdquo Ninety-five percent of commercial fleets say safety is a priority, but it rsquo s not their top priority. nbsp When asked to rank priorities from a list of options, respondents ranked increasing revenue 1 and minimizing expenses 2 higher than improving safety 3 . The costs of inaction Some businesses believe that investing in a safety program is too costly in the face of so many other expenses. However, research shows that costs add up faster without a safety program in place. A single, fatal motor vehicle collision costs 1.7 million , on average. And when a large commercial vehicle is involved, costs can soar into the millions. As accidents increase, insurance rates often rise. In fact, premium costs per mile have risen 47 in the last decade as nuclear verdicts have soared. Leveraging AI for better fleet safety Fleet safety programs can protect workers and prevent these astronomical costs. Motive rsquo s State of Safety Report shows that fleets with world-class safety programs experience fewer accidents and safety incidents, nbsp lower insurance premiums, and higher driver retention rates. nbsp And though some companies worry about driver pushback, businesses that deploy dual-facing dash cams actually retain more drivers in the long run, not less. In fact, fleets using dual-facing cameras saw a 3 increase in driver retention after 75 weeks when benchmarked against road-facing dash cam users. The most impactful road safety improvements are being driven by AI. Today rsquo s leaders simply cannot have a world-class safety program without AI, and they rsquo re seeing that in their own experience. A full nbsp 57 of fleets that use AI dash cams report a decline in unsafe driving behaviors . Meanwhile, 73 of leaders believe roads are safer with AI-enabled cameras dash cams 64 say AI is crucial for preventing accidents and coaching drivers and 49 say AI helps improve worker safety. At Motive, we create technology and educational guides that empower safety leaders to be change agents and make a real impact. Get on the path to world-class safety performance with our Ultimate Guide Building a World-Class Fleet Safety Program .

            "Learn how to assess fleet safety performance, identify gaps in your program, and make the right adjustments to improve.\n",
            "With road risk on the rise for commercial workers, it rsquo s more important than ever for fleet-based businesses to launch a safety program. And not just any fleet safety program ndash one that rsquo s world-class. After all, dangers on the road don rsquo t discriminate, so when it comes to protecting your team, you need to go the extra mile. But before you can get a top-notch program off the ground, you have to understand where you stand on safety. A safety assessment is a big undertaking, but it doesn rsquo t have to be overwhelming. With a step-by-step guide like this to help you, it won rsquo t be. Benchmark your current safety performance Benchmarking isn rsquo t a one-time exercise , it rsquo s a continuous cycle of measuring, analyzing, and improving fleet performance. Companies benchmark for different reasons, mostly to identify gaps, set performance goals, and see how they measure up against industry standards. When done well, benchmarking should answer important questions about your safety performance, including What kind of accidents are we most frequently having? How severe are they? Which unsafe driving behaviors are causing them? How often do accidents result in injury? There are several ways to determine where you stand on safety and how much further you need to go. To understand how your program needs to mature, take the 10-step assessment below. Identify gaps and set goals After assessing the current state of your safety program, some areas of improvement may be readily apparent while others are harder to pinpoint. If you rsquo re having difficulty, look for gaps in your program and set realistic goals. As surprising as it may seem, physical economy businesses don rsquo t always grasp the complexity of their most serious risks. Many perform well in one area but lack visibility and control in another. That rsquo s why conducting an honest assessment, and working to identify gaps, is critical. Whether you rsquo re reviewing safety data, conducting driver surveys, or tracking near-miss incidents, your efforts to set specific goals for improvement will pay off. By addressing vulnerabilities in your program, you rsquo ll prevent accidents, injuries, lawsuits, and damage to equipment. Create a safety metric Safety metrics are the key to tracking safety performance. Without them, safety managers are working in the dark, unable to know who rsquo s excelling or in need of coaching. nbsp To get the most from safety scores, it helps to know how to use them to your advantage. The most effective metrics evaluate driving performance over time. The Motive Safety Score , for example, gives an accurate measure of risk for each driver, based on how safe or unsafe their driving habits are. The Safety Score lets managers spot at a glance when a driver has improved, nbsp or needs to. With today rsquo s flexible coaching tools , safety managers can fully customize the weight of each driving behavior or turn behaviors off to better manage their safety program. Drivers, meanwhile, have full visibility into how they rsquo re scored, with detailed behavior breakdowns. Safety Scores show at a glance how your safety program is improving. Use them to measure the impact that coaching, safety policies, and tools like AI dash cams are having on safety performance. Track safety performance for your entire fleet or individually by driver. Assessing your safety readiness is just the start of your road to safer performance. Ready to take your safety program to the next level?

            "Amid a global freight recession, Mexico is booming. How is this possible, what can be learned from it, and how is China involved? Read on.\n",
            "Since 2019 the U.S. trucking industry has seen massive swings, from a boom in trucking firms and cargo volumes during the demand boom of the pandemic, followed by the historic freight recession that seems to only recently have improved . The U.S. rsquo s neighbor to the south, however, has not experienced the same turmoil. In fact, Mexico rsquo s trucking industry has seen only growth in spite of the many forces plaguing trucking markets in the U.S. and around the world. How is this possible, and what can be learned from it? Let rsquo s take a look. Shifting Imports One critical element to observe in these contrasting stories is the shift in imports from China to each country. Since 2019, there has been a notable decrease of nearly 5 in U.S. imports from China, while Mexico has Chinese imports surge by 37 in the same period. January of 2024 alone saw container volumes from China to Mexico rise 59.7 compared to 2023. While before 2019 there was steady growth of imports into the U.S. from China, it isn rsquo t likely that the level of growth seen previously will return any time soon. Factors like higher Chinese imports to other regions like South Asia and the EU and more protectionist trade policies in the U.S. are factors in this. But there is one commonality between China and the U.S. that may be contributing to Mexico rsquo s carrier market growth nearshoring. The Impact of Nearshoring Moving production facilities closer to the end market the U.S. , is significantly influencing this trend. Mexico has significant foreign direct investment especially directed to the border states like Nuevo Leon and Coahuila, the top 2 regions seeing investment in 2023. These trends are not only bolstering the country rsquo s economic stature but also its role in North American supply chains. We expect the trend of Chinese investment which grew from 83M in 2012 to 600M in 2022 to accelerate. Further to that point, from 2019 to 2023 U.S. imports from Mexico by both ground and ocean transit have consistently risen, culminating in a 33.1 rise in total import freight to the U.S. as of February 2024. In 2023 alone the number of Mexican trucking companies moving goods to the U.S. grew by 2.5 , and the fleet of vehicles expanded by 14 . This contrasts sharply with the U.S., where there has been a contraction of 6.6 in the number of trucking and transportation companies. Why is this happening? In part because as more U.S. companies move away from direct Chinese imports, they are also investing more in supply chains through Mexico. One sector where this can be observed is electrical machinery, equipment, and parts, imports of which have seen a 33.9 increase from 2019 to 2023. These make up 18 of Mexico rsquo s imports to the U.S., making it a key driver in the demand for Mexican carrier shipments. Outlook for 2024 and Beyond As Mexico integrates more deeply into global supply chains, the transportation and logistics sector is poised for ongoing growth. This burgeoning trade relationship with China, coupled with increased manufacturing and transportation capabilities, positions Mexico as a critical node in international trade, especially as businesses and governments look to diversify supply chains post-pandemic. Mexico rsquo s strategic position and growing economic ties with China are reshaping the North American trade landscape. As the world adapts to new economic realities, Mexico s role is becoming increasingly significant, promising more opportunities and growth in the transportation and logistics sectors.\n",

            "At Vision 24 - The Motive Innovation Summit, women leaders showed how they rsquo re pushing boundaries, breaking barriers, and fueling change. Across the physical economy, workers are busy taking to the road, building high-rises, and drilling for oil. Most often they rsquo re men, but with each passing year, more women are joining the ranks. Women in construction have jumped 53 in the last decade. About 1.3 million of them are employed today, accounting for 10.9 of the construction workforce. In trucking and logistics, women are continuing a slow, steady climb as well, making up 12 of the workforce . nbsp As women take on more impactful roles, the industrial world is in the midst of a renaissance, one that was on full display at Vision 24 , the inaugural Motive Innovation Summit. Leaders like Christine Estes , Clarissa Rankin , and Kate Woeffler shined in the spotlight. nbsp At a time when industries are working to become more diverse, the Driving Women Forward panel, led by Motive Head of Customer Marketing, Jeanne Nitschke , attracted a strong showing of allies and supporters as much as women. The Driving Women Forward Breakfast at Vision 24 in Nashville, TN. Women rsquo s empowerment starts with a vision for success For Estes, director of safety and recruiting at Usher Transport , working in the transportation industry is a family legacy. As the daughter of a truck driver, she was drawn to transportation from the start. nbsp ldquo My passion for the industry started in the passenger seat of my dad rsquo s truck, rdquo she says. ldquo Taking trips with him as a kid, seeing the impact that professional drivers have on their communities, that rsquo s what inspired me to get into this industry. rdquo As Usher Transport rsquo s first female safety director, Estes has made an impact, earning Employee of the Year honors. But her work is just beginning. nbsp ldquo I don rsquo t think the discussion should stop here. Seeing women in leadership roles should resonate across the industry. Because change is needed. rdquo mdash Christine Estes, director of safety and recruiting, Usher Transport On the road and online, Rankin is carving her own path. As an experienced driver with nearly 3 million social media followers, she rsquo s in a league of her own. Fresh out of CDL school, she set her sights on being the safest driver possible, then put in the work to make it happen. ldquo Starting out, I said to myself, lsquo I rsquo m going to become great at this. I rsquo m going to be the number one driver in the world. rsquo rdquo nbsp As the owner of a CDL trucking school herself, Rankin is well on her way. But don rsquo t be fooled by her long lashes and painted nails. When she arrives at the shipper, she rsquo s all business. Even with millions of followers, she knows her big personality hasn rsquo t won over everyone. And she doesn rsquo t care. nbsp ldquo When I first joined the industry, I couldn rsquo t find a job. I got turned down six different times. But then I went in there with my girly hair, long nails, and big personality, and that rsquo s what got me the job. So I always remember to be myself. If people are going to accept me in this industry, they have to accept me for who I am. rdquo mdash Clarissa Rankin Mentorship matters With women in the minority in physical jobs, it rsquo s crucial that they uplift and mentor each other, says Woelffer, a leader in Motive rsquo s Enterprise sales organization. As vice president of sales for strategic accounts, Woelffer works to impact the world around her in an incremental way, urging others to do the same. ldquo You don rsquo t have to be a career advocate to be an advocate for others in your daily life, rdquo she says. ldquo If we all look to move the needle by 1 , it can make a big difference, whether you rsquo re hiring, recruiting, or promoting through the ranks. rdquo Rankin feels a responsibility to support other women, whether they rsquo re new to driving or already established. nbsp ldquo Always remember to be the mentor and the mentee, rdquo she says. ldquo On one hand, I rsquo m a leader, a nurturer, a protector. I share positive energy, because energy is contagious. On the other hand, I rsquo m always open to learning, to being encouraged, to trying new things. rdquo Together we thrive For true progress to happen, it will take the support of male allies as much as women. Dialogue is the key to progress, Estes says. nbsp ldquo If you can find common ground through conversation and ask the right questions, opportunities will come to you, rdquo she tells other women. ldquo So break down barriers and progress into whatever you want to be. I think these things can happen. As an industry, we can grow together. It takes all of us, together. rdquo We want to hear from you and how you are the catalyst for change in your organization.

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the May 2024 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the May edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report. What follows is an analysis of the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform of 120,000 customers during the past month. Motive rsquo s transportation and logistics data is a reflection of consumer demand and therefore, a leading indicator of overall economic stability and trends. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Motive Predictions The U.S. freight recession will end in Q3 2024. nbsp By September the market will see its first net positive growth since 2022. Demand among brick-and-mortar-based retailers will stay strong through Q3. Mexican freight market growth shows no signs of slowing down. nbsp nbsp nbsp Nothing but blue skies ahead, right? Not so fast hellip While the freight recession is on its way out, its effects will not leave the market overnight. Yes, the overall lower trucking capacity it caused coupled with higher demand are positive signs for transportation and logistics businesses, but we do not expect a large correction for the overall market. We anticipate price improvements will hit spot rates first, and the overall rebalancing of the market will be gradual. It rsquo s worth noting that improvements will also be dependent on the U.S. economy continuing to grow. The takeaway Don rsquo t assume higher trucking rates are imminent. From seasonal pressures to economic considerations to unexpected demand shifts, there are still many factors to consider and we don rsquo t expect the new normal to be anything like the freight boom we saw during the pandemic. The freight market approaches positive growth as carrier exits decrease and registrations rise 1,149 trucking companies exited the market in April. While this is a slight increase from March, it still marks a 69 decrease compared to January and the second straight month with fewer than 2,000 exits. Similarly, while April rsquo s 8,769 new carrier registrations are a 7 decrease compared to March, nbsp it is also the third consecutive month with over 8,000 new entrants. These two indicators highlight that the market is approaching something not seen in almost 2 years positive carrier growth. This is further bolstered by retail sales continuing to climb and restocking maintaining its forward momentum see below for more . Given all of this, Motive is going beyond its previous prediction of a more carrier-friendly market in 2H and believes the most protracted freight recession in history will end by September of this year. Trucking visits to brick-and-mortar-based retail sectors pop in April Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index saw truck visits to the warehouses of the top 50 US retailers jump 1.3 since March and 4.3 year-over-year. The April measure rsquo s defining trend was a surge in demand from retailers largely operating brick-and-mortar stores. While dipping e-commerce sales have led to slower growth for that sector, department stores, apparel, and electronics saw a 32.2 jump year over year in visits in April. Home improvement, which Motive has predicted will close 2024 25-30 higher year-over-year, also continued to perform well with a 16.7 gain in April. Motive predicts that demand will remain strong for most brick-and-mortar-focused sectors like home improvement, and these will continue to outperform through Q3. Mexico rsquo s carrier market, bolstered by U.S. and China nearshoring, shows no signs of slowing While the U.S. is now slowly coming out of the freight recession, the Mexican carrier market seems to have missed its impacts altogether. Nearshoring has been a critical factor here, as the U.S. has increasingly shifted from relying on Chinese imports to those closer to home in Mexico. Imports from Mexico to the U.S have consistently risen from 2019-2023, culminating in a 33.1 rise in total import freight to the U.S. as of February 2024. However, China has also directly played a critical part in Mexico rsquo s growth in the freight market. While imports from China to the U.S. decreased by 5 from 2019-2023, imports to Mexico rose 37 . Furthermore, Chinese investment in Mexican facilities and infrastructure grew from roughly 83 million in 2012 to 600 million in 2022. As Mexico becomes a stronger gateway for getting products to North American consumers, expect its logistics and transportation sectors to continue, and even accelerate, in their growth. Data Methodology The Motive Monthly Economic Report uses aggregated and anonymized insights from the Motive network, as well as publicly available government data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, U.S. Census, and U.S. Department of Transportation.\n",

            "Efficiency is critical for any company, especially those that operate fleets. Every minute saved in administrative tasks translates to increased productivity and profitability. Companies rely on workforce management tools to enhance efficiency by streamlining critical Human Resources HR functions, such as timecards, tracking, and payroll. nbsp But it s not just simplifying manual processes that companies worry about regarding payroll. It s accuracy. According to IRS estimates , one-third of organizations make at least one payroll error a year. The consequence isn t just fixing mistakes although you should do that, too . Payroll errors also lead to fines ndash 7 billion in 2023 . nbsp What if companies could automate employee time log submissions to their preferred payroll systems and ensure accuracy by eliminating human error? nbsp nbsp Regardless of company size and industry, getting payroll right every time is critical. That means adhering to payroll best practices, such as developing a solid compensation plan, maintaining compliance, and paying people equitably.It sounds daunting, but Motive and our partners are here to help. nbsp Below are five tips to know so you can plan and manage payroll confidently. 1. Build a payroll policy To ensure organized and efficient processes, start by implementing a payroll policy. A payroll policy is a single truth source that operations or administration can follow. The policy provides preferred guidelines, so your team can accomplish payroll tasks accurately and efficiently. When building your payroll policy, assess the process, time, and resources needed to draft your plan and pay your people monthly. Consider including the following An outline of the payroll process Employee classification specifications Determining factors for salaries and wages Reporting obligations for employees Instructions and procedures for resolving payroll mistakes Levels of earnable vacation time Guidelines on how to calculate wages and promotions 2. Set a budget for payroll Payroll expenses shouldn t be a surprise. Plan salaries, bonuses, and other payroll expenses so you have the financial runway needed to pay drivers. nbsp Note Employers are also legally responsible for certain employment taxes , like Social Security and Medicare. Employers must match the Social Security and Medicare deductions from an employee s compensation, which amounts to 7.65 of gross pay and the employee s salary or hourly wage. Payroll taxes vary by state, so it s critical to consider this information when budgeting. 3. Educate Employees on Payroll Procedures One of the most essential steps is educating employees on payroll procedures. Your operations team should understand responsibilities and deadlines thoroughly and provide continuous training on the latest regulations, software updates, and payroll best practices. So your employees know how to submit driver logs properly and how to punch in and out. To share this information, you could nbsp Discuss payroll procedures in company meetings so everyone receives the same information and message. OR nbsp Upload the procedure to your company intranet or self-service portal for easy access anytime. 4. Maintain Proper Compliance Payroll and compliance go hand in hand.

            "Enhanced operational visibility helps companies reduce consumption and waste, boosting both profits and sustainability.\n",
            "Experts discuss implementing sustainable operations at Vision 24. Key takeaways With greater visibility into physical operations, companies can measure their impact and pinpoint areas to reduce consumption and waste that benefits both their bottom line and their sustainability efforts By using data to surface areas where operators can be more efficient, companies can be more profitable, reduce their costs, and reduce their environmental impact. The transition to zero-emission vehicles ZEVs is a road filled with complexities and economic decisions, but there are tools and levers like Motive rsquo s data analytics and fleet management services, Navistar rsquo s consulting programs, and Revoy rsquo s managed electrification solutions to help make a smooth transition Companies should be planning now and investing in the future where they can, as the market and regulatory pressures will demand sustainability measures, planning and lead times may be long-term projects, and getting ahead can give you a competitive advantage At Vision 24, Chief Product Officer Jai Rangananthan and I hosted a fireside chat and panel discussion about sustainable operations in the physical economy, focusing on the pressures for companies to improve their environmental sustainability, the realities and practical hurdles of becoming more sustainable, and what companies can and should be doing now to improve their operations and plan for the future. We organized this session to give our customers realistic, actionable insights and spur discussion and problem-solving at their organizations and amongst their peers. To inform and provoke genuine conversation around the realities of implementing sustainable operations, Motive put together an all-star, representative group of industry experts, including Motive customers, OEMs, and policy analysts to talk about these realities, without sugarcoating. The panel included Jeff Gorestki , the VP of Logistics for CRH Americas Paul Ruiz , the Director of Energy and Environment Policy at the American Trucking Associations ATA Stefan Sahlmann, Vice President EV Solutions Development amp Activation at Navistar Ian Rust , CEO of Revoy Jai Ranganathan , Motive rsquo s Chief Product Officer nbsp These panelists each gave insights from their perspectives on hot-button topics like nbsp The regulatory and market pressures, such as EPA rsquo s GHG Phase 3 Regulations , California rsquo s Advance Clean Fleets initiatives, and pressures from customers and the public The economic realities of implementing sustainability measures The reasons, and advantages of, taking steps now to improve a company rsquo s sustainability Here rsquo s a video of the panel, in full, but please read on below for a brief summary of the panel and more information and insights from our panelists. Panel Highlights Jeff Goretski of CRH Americas, an organization whose sustainability initiatives have been in full swing, partially as a result of being part of a European organization with aggressive net-zero goals and targets, discussed how CRH sees opportunities not only to reduce costs by being more efficient and reducing waste in their current operations, but also to create competitive and economic advantages by piloting, testing, and learning how to provide the sustainable operations that customers and regulators will be looking for tomorrow. nbsp Being ahead of the curve on ZEVs and low-carbon technology implementation allows CRH to understand where the total cost of ownership and return on investment works best while also sorting out the logistics and infrastructure of implementing new technologies into their operations, setting them up for a more cost-effective, streamlined future. nbsp While this strategy requires some upfront investment, CRH knows it sets them up for long-term, sustainable operations, which gives them an advantage, especially as implementation costs come down. Making investments today also gives CRH a leg up on the competition by providing sustainable offerings, while also making upscaling sustainable operations easier and more economical. CRH also invests heavily in funding innovation, seeking grants and incentives, and other programs and strategies to help sustainability make economic sense, knowing that these investments pay dividends down the road. CRH also focuses on reducing waste and being more efficient within their current operations because it reduces their footprint while saving money. Jeff noted that often by simply creating visibility around energy fuel consumption and benchmarking across their organization, operations managers inherently track and manage their performance to find ways to be more efficient, consume less, and reduce emissions while saving the organization money. As they say, what gets measured gets managed. Paul Ruiz of the ATA weighed in from a trucking policy perspective, noting first that people should be optimistic about how both the trucking industry and OEMs have come a long way in making transportation more energy efficient. He discussed the carrots i.e., customers willing to pay a premium and governments offering grants and incentives, such as those available from the IIJA and sticks i.e., regulatory requirements driving change in the trucking industry. He reflected thoughtfully and critically on the realities of meeting certain regulatory goals and targets. Moving to ZEVs in the commercial vehicle space is truly a three-pronged issue. It requires utilities and infrastructure, manufacturing and materials availability for ZEV technologies, and the economic realities and total cost of ownership placed on transportation companies to all interact in lock-step in a short time frame to make the changes and upgrades necessary to have a zero-emission trucking sector. These upgrades come at a high shared cost, as a recently released report set infrastructure upgrades alone at around 1 trillion. nbsp Paul urged the consideration of emission-reduction technologies other than battery-electric vehicles BEVs to make improvements more readily accessible and realistically implementable. He emphasized the importance of everything working in tandem on a realistic timeframe to ensure that companies have a good experience with ZEV implementation from a logistics, infrastructure, and total cost of ownership perspective. If companies invest in new technologies that are difficult to utilize, it could create friction and hesitancy in ZEV adoption. If companies are going to make heavy upfront investments, they need to have a smooth and economically efficient experience to want to participate in the shift to sustainability. Stefan Sahlmann spoke to Navistar rsquo s focus on battery-electric vehicles BEVs as the way of the future, believing strongly in the viability of this technology. He cited studies done in conjunction with industry groups that show BEVs produce the least amount of energy loss from manufacture to utilization in commercial transportation and are the most efficient path to a zero-emission future from a mass adoption perspective, although other technologies like fuel cells may have applications in more niche areas. nbsp Stefan highlighted how Navistar supports customers who want to transition so that implementation is seamlessly operational and economical. Navistar provides consulting programs to help customers plan by analyzing their current operations to determine where electric vehicles can be implemented into an organization rsquo s operations while also consulting on grants, incentives, infrastructure, and charging needs. nbsp Stefan noted that implementing new charging infrastructure at a customer location can take up to 24 months. That rsquo s why Navistar consults with customers on how to plan today for the operations of tomorrow, including supporting conversations with utilities and helping customers find grant programs and incentives to reduce the cost of implementation. As Stefan noted, no one is going to flip a switch and swap out a full fleet tomorrow. But it rsquo s incredibly important to get the conversation started today to figure out the best, most cost-effective way to begin BEV implementation and plan for infrastructure and inventory availability. Ian Rust , whose company Revoy provides battery electric services and a managed electrification solution that supports electrification on current internal combustion engine vehicles, added insight into costs and reasons to get ahead. He added valuable color and insight into the importance of starting early due to both market and regulatory pressures. Not being prepared for the transition to ZEVs is a risk for companies as customers start to demand reductions in their Scope 3 emissions, even before regulatory pressures force the issue. nbsp Ian also noted that the cost of a mile on electricity for Class 8 trucks is 0.10 mile vs. 0.60 or 0.70 on diesel, so there are clearly economic efficiencies available if BEVs are implemented appropriately. Further, if a company gets ahead of the competition, both with regards to getting in line with their utilities and offering low-carbon options to their customers, those economic efficiencies and opportunities increase. Companies late to the game may be struggling to provide customers with what they need, as getting their infrastructure in place and acquiring and implementing technologies could take 2 to 3 years. Jai Rangantahan , Motive rsquo s Chief Product Officer, discussed how Motive thinks about sustainability from a product perspective. Motive looks at providing visibility into immediate short-term activities that our customers can do to reduce consumption in their current operations, presenting an immediate economic and sustainability impact, such as improving fuel efficiency with driver behavior, vehicle maintenance, reducing idling, etc., while also working with them on long-term regulatory and environmental concerns. Motive also works to solve customers rsquo problems by helping determine how to implement ZEV technologies and other technologies in an economical and operationally efficient manner by evaluating data, routing, etc. in our customers rsquo current operations to help figure out the best and easiest areas to start making changes. Jai and I wrapped up the session by noting that although the move towards sustainability may involve difficulties, with various pressures and economic issues at play, we came out of the conversation with a lot of optimism because talented, driven, and interested people, like the ones on our panel, are tackling the matters thoughtfully to find solutions that move physical operations towards operating more sustainably. So long as we rsquo re all communicating and solving the problems together, we can tackle these matters efficiently and effectively for a more sustainable future. How Motive Can Help Motive helps customers make their current operations more efficient by giving greater visibility into areas where fuel economy can improve. Our driver coaching platform surfaces fuel consumption and ways for drivers to make improvements. We also provide preventive maintenance, routing and dispatching, and visibility into asset utilization to reduce the amount of waste in our customers rsquo operations so they can do more with less. Motive is also building the tools of the future to efficiently and effectively implement new low-emission or zero emission technologies into your operations. We integrate with all types of vehicles, from battery electric to hydrogen fuel cells, and surface them all in the same dashboard as internal combustion engine vehicles for ease of management, communication and visibility. We rsquo re also supporting customers in pinpointing areas to implement new technologies and helping them determine the economic return on investment and total cost of ownership for new vehicles. Motive also surfaces fuel consumption and carbon emissions on a per vehicle and per trip basis and helps our customers with their emissions reporting.\n",

            "The recent Baltimore bridge collapse has caused major disruptions in transportation and logistics, highlighting the vulnerability of our supply chains. Discover how Motive is analyzing the impact on freight movement and what it could mean for the future of logistics.\n",
            "The recent collapse of a major bridge in Baltimore has had a significant impact on the transportation and logistics sectors, causing widespread disruptions to the flow of goods. This incident is yet another reminder of how vulnerable our supply chains can be to unexpected events. At Motive, we ve been closely analyzing the data, and the early results paint a clear picture of how the collapse is affecting freight movement and what it might mean for the future. Immediate effects Freight activity takes a hit Our data shows a sharp decline in freight activity almost immediately following the collapse. Truck visits to the Port of Baltimore have dropped by 45.7 week-over-week, and overall truck activity has decreased by 49.1 since the incident occurred. These numbers indicate a substantial disruption to the supply chain, with fewer trucks able to access critical routes and ports. The effects are rippling throughout the transportation network, causing delays and requiring companies to reroute shipments. But this isn t just a short-term issue. The broader implications of events like this will be felt across the industry for months, if not years. Black Swan Events A growing pattern This collapse, while shocking, is part of a growing trend of black swan events that have plagued the transportation sector in recent years. From the Suez Canal blockage in 2021 to the COVID-related pileups at the Port of Long Beach, and even the recent drought-induced slowdown of the Panama Canal, disruptions have become more frequent and more costly. Each of these events exposed the fragility of global supply chains. And in each case, companies had to scramble to find alternative routes, adapt to delays, and absorb the additional costs of transportation and distribution. This is the new reality logistics leaders are facing the unexpected is becoming expected. Adapting to the new normal The key question now is how companies can prepare for these disruptions. In my view, the answer lies in agility and visibility. Flexibility in decision-making has become the single most important skill for supply chain and logistics leaders. Companies must be able to pivot quickly, reroute shipments, and adjust operations when the unexpected happens. This requires having real-time visibility into your operations whether it s monitoring truck activity, tracking port conditions, or managing inventory levels. With the right data at your fingertips, you can make faster, more informed decisions and minimize the impact of disruptions. Over the past five years, we ve seen this dynamic play out again and again. Major events whether natural disasters, political upheaval, or infrastructure failures have thrown the logistics sector into disarray. Costs have fluctuated wildly, and supply chains have had to evolve at a breakneck pace. Are these events becoming the new norm? The big question on everyone s mind is whether these events are still one-off occurrences or if we should consider them part of a new, ongoing pattern. I believe the latter is true. Disruptions to supply chains are becoming more frequent, and companies need to prepare for that reality. This means investing in the technology and infrastructure that allows you to adapt in real time. It s no longer enough to have a contingency plan businesses need to build resilience into their operations. The ability to reroute shipments, pivot distribution strategies, and make data-driven decisions in the face of disruption will be the defining factor of success in the coming years. At Motive, we re committed to helping businesses navigate this new landscape. Our data provides deep insights into the transportation and logistics sectors, and we re continuously analyzing trends to give companies the tools they need to stay ahead.

            "When it comes to running a market-leading safety program, you juggle numerous tasks every day to improve safety, reduce liability, and ensure your drivers get home safe every night. However, your organization faces unique challenges across diverse environments, and a one-size-fits-all safety approach makes it hard to effectively identify risk and coach your drivers. nbsp Motive not only leads in accurate detection of unsafe driving with AI, but offers the only fully customizable Driver Safety solution. Safety managers can customize their safety event uploads, in-cab alerts, and Safety Scores to suit their specific program needs. Take full control of your safety program and reduce risk, even if you don rsquo t have time to coach every unsafe behavior. Whether your drivers operate in the bustling streets of New York City or the quiet highways in Santa Barbara, now you can tailor every aspect of your safety program to your fleet rsquo s needs. Why customization matters Tailor behaviors to your safety goals Choose which unsafe behaviors to detect, alert, and include in your Safety Score, allowing you to focus on those most relevant to achieving your objectives. For example, urban delivery fleets might prioritize stop violations and distracted driving, while long-haul fleets may focus on fatigue and speeding. Adjust detection thresholds and disable behaviors as needed to match your risk criteria. Reduce liability and time spent reviewing video Only upload video for behaviors you have time to coach, focusing on severe infractions like cell phone usage to minimize liability if behaviors go unaddressed and ensure a targeted safety management approach. Empower drivers to self-correct Set in-cab alerts, such as for close following, to trigger before a video event is uploaded, giving drivers the chance to correct their behaviors without manager intervention. Events and alerts can be configured independently. In contrast, most other safety solutions don rsquo t offer self-service customization. If they do offer customization, their preset dropdowns lack depth and flexibility. Paul Fly, director of risk and safety at Ernst Concrete , appreciates Motive rsquo s Safety Score. ldquo The concrete industry is very unique and our trucks are heavy and have a high center of gravity. We can customize the Motive Safety Score specifically for our needs ndash like removing hard braking or hard acceleration ndash so that we have a more accurate score for our specific drivers and vehicles. rdquo Drive adoption with a flexible rollout strategy When deploying AI Dashcams and other safety technology, gradually introduce features so drivers can adapt to the technology at a comfortable pace and integrate it into their daily routines. The more opportunities workers have to interact with the technology and see how it works, the more they rsquo ll buy into the program . nbsp Motive rsquo s flexible safety solution allows you to adopt a crawl-walk-run approach to increase dash cam adoption and not overwhelm your drivers and managers. Crawl A common challenge during this phase is overcoming initial resistance to new technology and processes, especially from drivers who are reluctant to have a dash cam in their vehicle. This phase allows both drivers and managers to get used to the technology without feeling overwhelmed, setting a strong foundation for broader adoption. Managers can also review videos to establish a performance baseline. Start by reviewing the unsafe behaviors detected by Motive. In-cab alerts and event capture are automatically enabled for new accounts to give drivers maximum protection on the road. If preferred, you can start by only enabling alerts and event capture for key unsafe behaviors that matter most to your organization, leaving settings at Motive defaults. You can also opt to capture road-facing behaviors initially and driver-facing behaviors later. Disable the option for drivers to view their Safety Score and safety events in the Driver App. Walk nbsp During this phase, the primary challenge is maintaining driver engagement and ensuring they take ownership of their safety performance. This phase builds on the foundation by introducing coaching and self-assessment tools, helping drivers and managers further integrate the technology into daily operations. Drivers should feel increasingly empowered to manage and improve their safety record. Begin coaching with Coaching Sessions and enable drivers to view their safety events in the Driver App. Coaching Sessions provides a holistic view of your driver rsquo s coachable events, unsafe driving patterns, and coaching history. Allow Motive to automatically message drivers about coachable events to empower self-coaching. Introduce the Motive Safety Score, which evaluates driver performance over time for an accurate measure of driver risk. Provide drivers access to their Safety Scores in-app to gamify the experience and generate friendly competition. Fully customize the weight of each behavior in the Safety Score or turn off specific behaviors with advanced controls. You can also define the performance ranges and specify which Safety Scores qualify as Fair, Good, and Excellent. nbsp Run nbsp In this phase, the challenge is fine-tuning the technology to maximize its effectiveness while ensuring drivers are not overwhelmed by alerts. Additionally, fully leveraging reports to understand the effectiveness of your coaching is crucial. This phase solidifies the integration of technology into everyday operations, fostering a proactive safety culture. As drivers become accustomed to post-trip coaching with their videos, activate in-cab alerts if they rsquo re turned off, one or a few behaviors at a time. nbsp You can adjust the thresholds at which unsafe behaviors are captured and in-cab alerts trigger, with the ability to coach drivers in-cab before uploading videos for review. Choose from five basic preset options for event capture and in-cab alert thresholds. Lower threshold groups generate more events and alerts. Higher threshold groups generate fewer but more severe events and alerts. Advanced settings allow you to modify specific threshold values, such as minimum speed, duration, or time-to-hit values, to align with your safety program. Track performance across the behaviors you care about with driver safety profiles and detailed safety reports. A solution that adapts to your needs When you re responsible for the safety of thousands of drivers, having a solution that adapts to your needs and allows you to focus on the greatest risks is critical for success.

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the June 2024 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the June edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report. What follows is an analysis of the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform of 120,000 customers during the past month. Motive rsquo s transportation and logistics data is a reflection of consumer demand and therefore, a leading indicator of overall economic stability and trends. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Motive Predictions Higher freight-per-mile rates in peak season will squeeze the bottom lines of retailers and give carriers more leverage in Q4, early 2025. While the effect won rsquo t be immediate, higher rates will cause further increases in consumer prices by Q2 2025. The entire supply chain will get more expensive, and many retailers need to rethink their low-inventory restocking strategies. Trucking and logistics jobs will climb significantly by the end of the year as Q3 will bring the first net-positive growth of the trucking market since 2022. Retailer restocking demand remains strong, but rising rates will flip the supply chain power dynamic. Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index saw truck visits to the warehouses of the top 50 U.S. retailers jump 4 since April and 7.8 year-over-year. Significant year-over-year jumps were seen across all sectors observed, especially home improvement 29.1 , department stores, apparel and electronics 27.7 , and grocery and superstores 22.6 . We expect these numbers to cool in June, given they were somewhat inflated by Memorial Day. However, these strong showings illustrate that retailers are well past trying to offload excess inventory and are restocking at healthy levels. The current combination of lower rates and higher capacity has afforded these shippers both lower costs and more flexibility in moving their products. But with fewer overall carriers operating in the market, the per-mile rates to move goods will rise and impact retailer and shipper bottom lines and flexibility via the spot market. This dynamic is already underway for ocean carriers, and the trucking market will see a similar landscape later in the year. With consumers spending less in the current economic environment, retailers will need to absorb these financial impacts to keep prices low and demand high. Inevitably, however, they will need to start passing these costs to consumers. Motive predicts that by the end of 2024 Q1 2025, retailer profitability will be hindered by rising rates, while carriers will see profitability rise. Resultant consumer price increases are expected by Q2 2025. Higher shipping rates mean many retailers will need to rethink lean restocking. nbsp Though demand has trended upward for several months, retailer-to-sales inventory levels have stabilized at 1.3 after gradually decreasing from post-pandemic highs in March 2022. This indicates that retailers are operating with less inventory and an overall leaner resticking model, bringing inventory in closer to when they are selling it. nbsp But how will retailers react to the aforementioned price increase taking hold and affecting their bottom line? They rsquo ll have to make a choice do we bring more inventory in early before the prices spike later in the year, or do we continue to operate ldquo lean rdquo inventories and maintain flexibility in case demand falls off? For non-durable sectors like department stores, apparel, and electronics, this will be a particularly tough choice and will require very accurate projections of what demand will look like through peak season and into Q1 of next year. Motive predicts significant volatility in inventory levels and overall profitability in the department store, apparel, and electronics sectors in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. May trucking and logistics market growth remained stable and moved closer to positive growth, suggesting that trucking jobs will see an upswing by the end of the year. 1,229 trucking companies exited the market in May, representing a slight increase from March but coming in 67 lower than January. May marked the third consecutive month with fewer than 2,000 exits, indicating that market contraction continues to stabilize and move toward positive growth . nbsp New carrier registrations told a similar story, as May saw 8,466 companies registered. While this represents a drop of 3.6 compared to April, it is also the fourth consecutive month with over 8,000 new market entrants. A total of 43,311 new carriers entered the market in 2024, compared to 31,754 over the same period in 2019, marking the recovery of this metric from the boom-bust cycle caused by the pandemic. While trucking jobs in May have trended downward , this data, coupled with coming price increases, indicates a high likelihood that trucking jobs will see an upswing. Motive maintains its prediction that positive carrier growth will occur in the next three months of 2024 and that trucking jobs will climb significantly by the end of the year. Higher rates may be coming, but don rsquo t assume automatic profitability. This month rsquo s report highlights a shifting market that will eventually be much more favorable for carriers. However, it rsquo s important to acknowledge that, like all trends, there is a lot of nuance, and a completely positive outlook for carriers isn rsquo t guaranteed. Demand, for example, could go down as consumers feel further inflationary pressure. A key supply chain disruption could mean huge challenges for carriers in the affected region or downstream effects . And the same inflationary pressure felt by retailers and consumers is also impacting carriers. This amplifies the importance of operating lean and efficiently. Carriers must carefully monitor factors like consumer demand and costs related to safety incidents and inputs like fuel to best navigate the current climate, and take advantage of future opportunities. Data Methodology The Motive Monthly Economic Report uses aggregated and anonymized insights from the Motive network and publicly available government data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, U.S. Census, and U.S. Department of Transportation.\n",

            "In the webinar Insights that Matter Growing savings through integrated fleet and spend , Sean Byrnes, Motive rsquo s senior SME, Financial Products, interviewed Adam Stowers, equipment manager at Hardy and Harper , about the success they rsquo re having using the Motive platform. nbsp Based in Lake Forest, California, Hardy and Harper is a leading asphalt paving contractor specializing in major commercial and public works construction projects. With 150 employees and 300 assets, they rsquo ve been in business for 50 years. nbsp In this post, you will learn what drove Hardy amp Harper rsquo s decision to invest in dual-facing dash cams, and how the Motive Card has taken Hardy amp Harper rsquo s spend management to a new level. Watch the video to catch the full webinar, and continue reading for discussion highlights. What drove Hardy amp Harper rsquo s search for a new fleet management partner Sean Byrnes ldquo Let s dial back nine months ago. What prompted you to search for a new fleet management vendor? rdquo Adam Stowers ldquo When I came on board at Hardy amp Harper, things were on a spreadsheet, but the spreadsheet was really wonky. It was really hit-and-miss. I think it was actually Motive that hosted a webinar where they basically said spreadsheets are a dead entity in the long-term effect. nbsp ldquo I wanted a way to bring this to the cloud. We had a previous GPS provider, but like the spreadsheet, it was all over the place. Things were input in a lot of different ways. We weren t getting great support. That led us to start looking around. rdquo nbsp Sean Byrnes ldquo When you were evaluating different vendors, what were you really looking for in a vendor or a partner to help you with the fleet management side? rdquo Adam Stowers ldquo We were looking for support. I wanted someone who could help us build this from the ground up and start over. When we were talking to the guys, even during the demo stage, the hardware was one thing, but the support we received was something completely different. rdquo Sean Byrnes ldquo I remember the questions you were asking during the demos and in the trials. You put us through the ringer. But I m glad to hear we were able to help you solve a lot of the problems you were running into. rdquo nbsp Why Hardy amp Harper changed their tune on driver-facing cameras Sean Byrnes ldquo One of the things we had talked about last year was deprioritizing dash cams. I think at the time when we were talking, it wasn t a huge sticking point for Hardy amp Harper, but that had changed over time. What really changed about your needs or the Motive system that made you say, ldquo You know what, I do need to look at cameras for my fleet? rdquo Adam Stowers ldquo Dash cams are volatile. I think in any company that you go to, whether it s the biggest company or the smallest company, it s one of those things where everybody and I even remember myself being the same way when I was younger, like I m not going with cameras, I ll never do cameras. ldquo And then I was only gonna do forward-facing cameras and then I ended up doing the trial with Motive and a few other guys. I actually ran three different guys through the ringer. I wanted to see which horse was gonna actually lead. nbsp ldquo I actually had two incidents, one with Motive and one with someone else. Once I had dual-facing dash cams in there I could see that they provided speed and brake pressure. It provided what the driver was doing, and it was really a voice for the driver. Prior to that, literally, if there was an accident, it was automatically our fault. ldquo We had one incident where someone was trying to pass us on the right-hand side through a signal the camera picked up. The driver-facing camera picked up the fish eye in the passenger mirror. The actual passenger mirror picked up the fish eye and it clearly showed the vehicle coming from the right-hand side and turning into our vehicle. That changed everything. When I put that through, it was an automatic reject from the insurance company. They completely denied the claim. It made it where I could actually push cameras forward. rdquo ldquo Then it was just a matter of getting everybody on board. Like lsquo We re doing cameras and this is why. rsquo rdquo How the Motive Card lsquo changed everything rsquo for Hardy amp Harper Sean Byrnes ldquo Anything else that came up during your trial process that helped you decide to go with Motive? rdquo Adam Stowers ldquo Motive was the complete package. What really changed everything for me and drove Motive forward was the Motive Card. That was the deciding factor. ldquo Everybody has to do what they call a DVIR. Those are basically reports they have to do for all their trucks. They re required federally for any time there s something wrong or something that can put it out of service. What we require internally is a DVIR every day. So when we started testing it under the Motive platform, you could actually do your DVIRs right there. But how do we get everybody to actually commit to doing the DVIRs? ldquo That s kind of like how do we get them to commit to using the app ? I had prior GPS, so I had prior apps before, but I couldn t get people to download the app. There was no way to enforce it. But with the Motive Card, you actually force the use of the app because you can lock down the cards. nbsp ldquo Well, with the card being permanently locked, I can force the app to open it up, so the app unlocks it. That was really the key. Once I could find a way to force participation with the actual app, now, all of a sudden we get a full 360 view because now we can get driver input or forced driver input. So we know where they re at and that s really changed things as far as moving forward on that. rdquo Sean Byrnes ldquo And so it s almost like a backdoor way to get drivers to buy into utilizing the app because they are forced to use it when they want to use the Motive Card. rdquo Adam Stowers ldquo Yeah. We have infinite capabilities with it. So now the cards aren t coveted. It rsquo s not like the old card where a driver could take it, use it with their personal car on his days off or whatever. Because the Motive Card has the lock system, we were able to completely change our entire platform and how we distributed fuel cards, registered drivers, and got feedback on assets. ldquo Sean Byrnes ldquo So it sounds like you re using the platform more as a business management tool where you re managing drivers day to day, new drivers coming on, new assets coming on. It really sounds like an operational hub for Hardy and Harper. rdquo Adam Stowers ldquo Yeah, and that s really where you want to go. rdquo For more about how Hardy amp Harper is using the Motive platform to improve the safety, productivity, and profitability of their operations, read our Hardy amp Harper case study .\n",

            "The cost of doing business is going up. It rsquo s a common complaint no matter the industry. Motive rsquo s Physical Economy Outlook Report found that rising costs were the number one challenge threatening physical operations last year. To help fleets reduce costs, Motive Card has built a savings network of over 25,000 partner locations nationwide, providing deep discounts on fuel, maintenance, and more at brands like Love rsquo s, TA, Casey rsquo s, 7-Eleven, and Exxon. Our Savings Finder tool in the Driver App helps drivers navigate to the best savings by showing nearby fueling locations alongside real-time fuel prices and Motive Card rebates. nbsp However, it rsquo s the drivers that make the decisions on where they fuel up every day, so the real game-changer for fleets lies in ensuring the effective utilization of these savings tools. How can managers guarantee that their drivers choose to stop at the cheapest fueling location every time instead of stopping out of habit or convenience? Enter Motive rsquo s new Missed Savings feature, empowering fleet managers with increased visibility into drivers rsquo fueling choices and the ability to influence behavior on the road. Fleet managers can now see exactly where their drivers have missed out on savings and how much it is costing them via personalized emails or within the Motive Dashboard. nbsp This data-driven approach allows fleet managers to take action to correct these habits by coaching their drivers to make cheaper fueling choices, or by blocking locations where they frequently observe higher prices. nbsp And this feature is already making a difference for businesses. Early data shows that some fleets are missing savings of as much as 5 of their fuel spend. This means that a 1,000-vehicle fleet spending approximately 1 million on fuel every month could potentially save 50k monthly or 600k annually. nbsp Rising fuel costs put pressure on all businesses that operate commercial vehicles, but it rsquo s especially acute for the trucking industry in particular, which moves approximately 72.6 of the nation rsquo s freight by weight 8203 8203 . 8203 With the fuel expenditure for the trucking industry around 134 billion annually, the trucking sector alone potentially missed out on approximately 6.7 billion in fuel savings in 2023 based on missed savings of as much as 5 . Identifying missed savings and taking action would be impossible to do at scale without Motive rsquo s integrated view of data, as it would require hours of manual reconciliations and matchbacks. As the only operations platform with natively integrated spend management, Motive is the only provider that gives visibility into missed savings and can help fleets significantly reduce their costs through automated reporting and coaching recommendations. nbsp Current Motive Card customers can see Missed Savings data in their Motive Dashboard today.

Watch the video above to see how AI-powered tools are changing the game for field service operators, and continue reading for conversation highlights. The following text has been edited for brevity and clarity. Chris Rand ldquo Hi, everyone, joining me today, we have Nick Oney, director of fleet at Xylem Kendall. Thanks for being here. Did you want to go ahead and share a little bit about yourself? rdquo Nick Oney ldquo Yeah, absolutely. Appreciate the opportunity to speak on this webinar. So Nick Oney, director of fleet for Xylem and Kendall. We are line-clearing contractors. This means we trim trees for power companies, trim trees away from power lines. We are in about 25 different states, work for over 100 different utilities, and continue to grow portfolio sizes around them over thousands of assets, each of them having Motive devices. rdquo Chris Rand ldquo Also with us is Jim Higby, lead safety and compliance strategy at Motive. Jim, thanks for being here. Did you want to share a little bit about yourself? rdquo Jim Higby ldquo I m with Motive. We re a leading technology provider for fleet safety and telematics along with fuel spend and things like that. I ve got about 30 years of experience in the fleet safety industry working for larger companies, such as Ryder and Fedex Express. I ve managed entire fleet safety programs from a compliance aspect, but also telematics and videomatics. rdquo Chris Rand ldquo Thank you. I wanted to start, by sharing a little bit about two surveys WBR Insights conducted in partnership with Motive. The respondents of the surveys were senior leaders in field service, operations, safety, service, fleet management, and other leadership roles for organizations across verticals. Most of them have 101 to 10,000 or more vehicles or assets and more than one billion to ten billion dollars or more in annual revenue. ldquo One of the things we found was that technology advancements in fleet and workforce management have transformed the industry, providing greater visibility into assets and operations. But even with those significant gains, service teams are still struggling to achieve really effective cost management. ldquo The surveys also highlighted the primary challenges faced by fleet and field service leaders. Those included managing rising fuel costs, handling operational costs related to accidents and unsafe driving, and addressing issues of equipment theft, fraud, or unauthorized use. ldquo I think it s time we heard from our panelists, and Jim, I d like to start with you. From your perspective, do these challenges align with the biggest challenges you re seeing today, especially in any areas where new technologies might help improve operations? rdquo Jim Higby ldquo Yes, absolutely. It does align and there are a few things that have happened in the past that contribute to this. The first is new technology has become available at different segments through time and is affecting different portions of the operation. So, with this, it s promoted somewhat of a siloed approach to the data and how they manage businesses or and their fleets. ldquo This leads to a second point and the technology that s procured through the years. There s really no option, or a very difficult option, for integration, which becomes even more difficult for them to manage through the visibility of data and technology. They ve realized how cumbersome this is and how costly. It rsquo s a challenge for fleet operators and leaders within the organization to really manage this data and be efficient. ldquo Lastly, technology is advancing very quickly. Capabilities that weren t available in the past are now available. The ability to integrate all this technology into a single platform is very valuable for the consumer. In addition to that, the ability to update hardware and software as technology improves and advances so quickly is extremely desirable. All of these elements are contributing to this need to reevaluate technology. ldquo Nick, do you have anything to add? rdquo Nick Oney ldquo I think this list of pain points aligns with what we ve experienced as an organization. We ve grown, we rsquo ve had different technologies that are used by different departments. So having a way to integrate all of that leads to big organizational KPIs, and changes can be difficult. We re all speaking different languages, pulling information from different sources. So it can be challenging to align all of that information together. rdquo Chris Rand ldquo So I wanted to get into the driving forces behind some of these trends. Jim, I know you had some things that you wanted to share specifically on the matter. rdquo Jim Higby ldquo It s not surprising that fuel costs are at the top of the list of challenges for leaders. It s a leading expense for fleets, the largest expense for fleets in some cases. It s one of the most volatile costs they have to control and they just feel like they re out of control, quite honestly, as it relates to fuel. ldquo One of the most surprising findings we learned from the study that we previously mentioned is that operators are estimating that 19 of the losses are actually due to fraud. This is skimming at the pump for what we call friendly fraud. On top of this, the cost of fuel and maintenance has risen 46 rise in the last four years. ldquo Some of the forces that are driving this fraud and fuel efficiency is driver behavior, and you never even realize how much driver behavior affects it until you have the technology to monitor it. So, this comes as a challenge for businesses. rdquo Chris Rand ldquo Yeah, I just wanted to say that 19 figure is pretty shocking. And I think the insight that you really just don t know what you re missing if you don t have the technology to see it is a good one. ldquo So back to our research, we found that current technologies are failing operators in three key areas when it comes to mitigating fleet expenses. Those areas include reducing losses due to fraud, obtaining maintenance discounts, and obtaining fuel discounts. ldquo Most say their tools are not very effective or not effective at all at helping in these areas. So these issues with mitigating fleet expenses ndash to bring up my next question here ndash Nick, I d like to start with you on this one. Where do you see the greatest opportunity for improving spend management capabilities today? rdquo Nick Oney ldquo I think it rsquo s really in having spend visibility and being able to identify where spend is coming from. Most platforms now can offer drill-down features where you can set high-level KPIs. And if there s something that you need to study in a more granular way, you re able to click into it, drill down, and figure it out. nbsp ldquo Some questions we ask is how do you collect data? How can you present it? How do you make it actionable? So a couple of things we ve done, we dove into our equipment expenses related to repairs, and really looked at preventative maintenance versus active maintenance. That led us to perform DOTs every time we do oil changes, and that makes us overly compliant. It also helps us find issues and get a handle on them before they turn into bigger issues. Another thing we did was monitor idle time. rdquo nbsp Chris Rand ldquo Jim, did you have anything you wanted to add to that? rdquo nbsp Jim Higby ldquo Just a couple of things. AI is proven to really give companies an advantage when it comes to managing all these different things. Nick touched on a few but it really comes down to driver behavior, sustainability, and spend management solutions. ldquo So we just touched on driver behavior for one and Nick had mentioned idle time, but there s also a lack of visibility when you don t have the proper systems and technology. As it relates to route optimization, you can help route your drivers relative to traffic or rush hours or the most efficient route from point A to Z. nbsp ldquo What you sometimes don rsquo t realize is what rsquo s happening from point A to Z. They could be going off-route or out of their service area for a number of personal reasons. It could also be just a lack of understanding as it relates to what the expectations are. ldquo So this new technology gives the ability to understand where your people are, and what the driver behaviors are that are contributing to some of the inefficiencies, and additional costs related to operating a business in fleet services.\n",

            "Operation Safe Driver Week is upon us, and fleets across North America are ready for the law enforcement blitz. From July 7 to 13 , law enforcement in the United States, Canada, and Mexico will crack down on unsafe driving, with a particular focus on reckless, careless, and dangerous maneuvers. nbsp At a time when driver actions and behaviors contribute to 94 of all traffic crashes , the high-visibility enforcement blitz from the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance CVSA hopes to reduce risky driving habits and the accidents they cause. Read on to learn more about the goal of Operation Safe Driver Week, what to expect from the 2024 campaign, and how to prepare. What is Operation Safe Driver Week? Organized by the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance CVSA , Operation Safe Driver Week is an annual event aimed at reducing unsafe driving behaviors and preventing crashes. Law enforcement officers across North America strictly enforce traffic laws during the initiative, with a stronger presence than usual. nbsp Operation Safe Driver Week Targets the unsafe driving behaviors of commercial drivers and others. Shows the motoring public how to share the road with large commercial vehicles like trucks and buses. Offers commercial driver education and awareness programs. Improves commercial motor vehicle driver regulatory compliance. Conducts traffic enforcement initiatives for all vehicles on the road. Operation Safe Driver Week 2024 mdash reckless, careless, and dangerous driving Highlighting a different safety area each year, the 2024 campaign puts distracted and aggressive driving in the spotlight. This year, law enforcement will be quick to issue citations for the following behaviors. Close following Driving while distracted Speeding Hard braking Weaving in and out of traffic Cutting in front of another driver and then slowing down Changing lanes without signaling Blocking cars attempting to pass or change lanes Rolling stops Behaviors like these are shown to have a high correlation with crash risk. In its ldquo Predicting Truck Crash Involvement rdquo study from 2022, the American Transportation Research Institute ATRI found that drivers with reckless driving violations were 104 more likely than the average driver to be involved in a crash in the next 12 months. In fact, reckless driving is more predictive of future crash risk than any other driving behavior out there. Fortunately, fleets have tools at their disposal to prevent reckless driving, distracted driving , and other high-risk behaviors. AI dash cams, like the Motive AI Dashcam , can help fleets identify these behaviors and implement comprehensive coaching programs to assist drivers in dramatically improving their performance. nbsp When you blend AI dash cams with a dedicated coaching program, your team can benefit from fewer accidents, safer drivers, and lower costs. The impact can be significant a recent study showed that Motive AI Dashcam customers who frequently coach experience an average of 50 fewer accidents than those who don t. AI dash cams and coaching are just part of a broader safety strategy. The best safety programs benchmark safety performance through near-miss reports, traffic citations, and other data. Then, they coach drivers to bring down their incident rates. nbsp Motive is here to help During the summer months, when there rsquo s more traffic and risk on the road, fleets must increase their driver safety awareness and do all they can to prevent accidents. Last year, law enforcement issued nearly 6,000 warnings and 4,500 citations during Operation Safe Driver Week. These numbers highlight the critical need for employers to prioritize safe driving and improve fleet safety.

            "The KLX tagline is ldquo Next Level Readiness. rdquo Every day, that means going above and beyond to plan even the smallest details of their projects for customers, thinking ahead and bringing experienced perspective and specialized technologies that help customers get ahead of potential problems. ldquo Next Level Readiness rdquo is a rallying cry for KLX rsquo s 2,000 employees who tackle mission-critical onshore oil field services. Every detail matters, especially the safety of the employees who work in some of the roughest and toughest conditions in the U.S. Safety in oil fields is serious business and KLX knows it rsquo s no joke. Technology plays a critical role in KLX rsquo s safety strategy and the company has deployed Motive dual-facing AI Dashcams , Vehicle Gateways , and Asset Gateways throughout its fleet of 2,000 vehicles and has adopted Motive Card for its spend management operations. Doug Barnette , vice president of Health, Safety, Environmental for KLX Energy Services, calls it ldquo game-changing. rdquo KLX has seen a 15,000 monthly savings in fuel spend and a 50 reduction in unidentified drivers almost overnight, plus a steep reduction in at-fault accidents. nbsp At Vision 24 The Motive Innovation Summit , Motive Chief Customer Officer Ryan Plutnicki sat down for an interview with Barnette. During the conversation, Barnett explained Motive rsquo s AI-powered technology s impact on KLX performance and safety across their operations. Watch the video below for the discussion, and read on for Barnette rsquo s key takeaways. Turn a negative into a positive Ryan Plutnicki ldquo I remember, over dinner one night you shared with me something that s kind of difficult to talk about. But there was a pretty bad accident that was occurring at the same time that you were making the decision to switch to Motive. rdquo Doug Barnette ldquo In the fall of 2022, we had a significant accident and our insurance costs increased year over year just from that one incident over 50 . nbsp ldquo So it was very important to really look at that incident and not just do the root cause analysis and identify the consequences and what led up to it, but really tear apart our whole fleet strategy and ultimately internal controls on background, utilizing MVR, making sure that every driver we had behind the wheel was compliant with our standards to drive. nbsp ldquo And then using Motive, we went to the AI Dashcams to really be that verifier of all of these controls that we put in place. And it was key. What we saw immediately was a significant improvement in our performance in regards to at-fault vehicle incidents. And, you know, it was so meaningful for the company to really look at all these pieces. We looked at resources. We expanded our fleet team. We looked at how we utilize our vehicles. And through Motive, we were able to really quantify all these activities and verify that how we wanted it to be, was actually being done. rdquo We dropped our vehicle incidents by half almost overnight Ryan Plutnicki ldquo So 2,000 vehicles, that rsquo s a huge project. And it required quite a bit of change management, I imagine. rdquo nbsp Doug Barnette ldquo It did. We started 100 on the Motive road-facing AI Dashcams. Immediately, we saw a significant improvement. And, going back to insurance, we rsquo re actually able to leverage, ultimately, that we re having fewer events. Last year, we had four months straight without one vehicle incident, which I had never actually experienced before. nbsp ldquo We took that same message to our insurance carriers and said, lsquo Hey, you can underwrite consistency. I know you can t underwrite these peaks and valleys we have with our vehicle incidents. rsquo But we re able to put in front of them the narrative that you can almost plan ldquo to a T rdquo how many vehicle incidents we ll have each month now based on the technology we re utilizing. rdquo With Motive, we have technology to prevent fraud Ryan Plutnicki ldquo You also rolled out the Motive Card, right? rdquo Doug Barnette ldquo It was a no-brainer for us. We have the ability to, instead of sending an email and memo that goes out, say to our drivers lsquo Hey, this is where you need to go if you re fueling up. rsquo The drivers are on the road in the middle of nowhere, whether it s North Dakota, Texas, or West Virginia. With the Motive Card, they just get to see where their savings are. nbsp ldquo So with that being said, ultimately, we immediately started to experience, on average, about 15,000 a month in savings with Motive versus our previous provider. And another benefit, we reduced our unidentified drivers by 50 almost overnight just due to the fact that employees were having to use their Motive Driver App to unlock their card, which means they were logging into the vehicle. So ultimately, there are so many more benefits. rdquo We put people first Ryan Plutnicki ldquo We re extremely committed to an ongoing partnership of co-innovation with our customers. Very excited about the journey ahead. I d love to hear how this impacted you personally. rdquo Doug Barnette ldquo As my career has developed, I ve always found myself getting more in the back office, sitting in corporate. Implementing this Motive project has really put me in front of the people that make our business work. We re a people business just like most businesses are. And instead of sitting in an office implementing policies and procedures and strategies, we rsquo re able to get in front of the people new to our industry and have that one-on-one contact with individuals and show them, not only is it important for our company to do this, but I truly care about your safety and your ability to get home every day. ldquo Being able to drive that message one-on-one and in groups to people that I don t see every day to really let them know, regardless of what you think, this will save lives. This technology is game changing. We ve seen the effect of it and are looking forward to increasing that effect as technology advances and AI continues to improve. As a safety professional, the hardest thing to do is to go home and sleep well at night. And right now, I sleep much better than I did before we started implementing Motive. rdquo I rsquo m very passionate about ESG Ryan Plutnicki ldquo Your title is Vice President of Health, Safety, and Environment. I don rsquo t always think of the environment or sustainability when I think of an oil and gas company. What does that look like? rdquo Doug Barnette ldquo I was born and raised in Alaska. So I spent my whole childhood hiking and fishing on pristine glacier waters. I ve had the ability to see climate change throughout the years in my hometown. When I was a child, I was able to see glaciers from a lookout point. Today, it rsquo s very different. So it is very meaningful for me to ensure that we re responsible even in oil and gas, knowing that our job is to get oil and gas out of the ground. nbsp ldquo Emissions, all of those pieces, are significant when you start looking at what rsquo s the biggest cause for climate change. But at the same time, one of the best things I enjoy with Motive is we have Fleet View. We have our portal. We know where all the vehicles are. In the same portal, we rsquo ve attached all of our fuel usage, all of our fuel spend, the ease of IFTA reporting, all of those things. And now, as we start getting into sustainability and ESG reporting, we have that ability to really know what our baseline is. That rsquo s the key, understanding what your baseline is. rdquo There are lots of vendors in this space, but Motive is a partnership Ryan Plutnicki ldquo One thing that s really near and dear to my heart, overseeing the implementation support and customer success organization, is that we really strive for unmatched customer experience. We look at this as much more of a partnership than a vendor-customer relationship. And I would love to get your thoughts on what we re doing well there and where you d like to see us go. rdquo Doug Barnette ldquo I will say throughout, whether it s been the Motive Card or dash cam implementation, my experience wasn t just lsquo We signed the contract, Hey, good luck. rsquo Every step of the way, especially when we recognized how difficult it would be for people to receive the message that we re putting this equipment into our vehicles, it was all of a sudden, lsquo Hey, do you have FAQs? rsquo Just the tireless amount of work that the Motive team did to meet our needs. They were so key in the communication plans. nbsp ldquo And even more so when we implemented the Motive Cards. We had live Motive reps do manager training over Microsoft Teams, multiple sessions throughout a week. So all of our management understood how coaching worked. And then my Motive team supported us and really went above and beyond. We have many vendors. Everyone has lots of vendors in this space, but Motive feels like a partnership. And they are. rdquo For more on the success KLX has had with Motive rsquo s AI Dashcams, read our article in Oil and Gas Journal .\n",

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the July 2024 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the July edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report. What follows is an analysis of the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform of 120,000 customers during the past month. Motive rsquo s transportation and logistics data is a reflection of consumer demand and therefore, a leading indicator of overall economic stability and trends. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Motive Predictions Retail sales will be higher this July vs July of 2023 as the 4th of July and Amazon Prime Day drive sales. nbsp Retailers must change their inventory management strategy by the end-of-year holiday season, as freight rates, similar to what rsquo s happening with ocean rates now, rise and make last-minute restocking more expensive. We rsquo ll see some consumer prices go up by Q2 of 2025 due to higher supply chain costs. The freight recession is on its way out and the trucking market will steadily move in a positive direction in the second half of the year. Top Findings Retailers, especially brick and mortar, are preparing for a strong July as they aggressively restock inventories at a markedly higher rate compared to 2023. nbsp Retailers continue to pursue low inventory strategies as last-minute restocking persists. The number of new entrants to trucking is stabilizing as the market moves toward positive growth. Retailers anticipate record July sales fueled by July 4th and Amazon Prime Day June saw one of the strongest month-over-month jumps to date for retailer restocking , according to Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index. The metric, which tracks visits to warehouses of the top 50 U.S. retailers, jumped 10.8 since May, and 16 year-over-year. While these rates typically rise in summer months, this year rsquo s surge indicates retailers are expecting bigger summer sales than last year and we predict they rsquo ll see record sales for the month of July. The 4th of July holiday, Amazon Prime Day, and other retailers rsquo competing promotions are what most likely drove the increase. One of the biggest retail moments of the year, Amazon Prime Day, drives many retailers to run competing discounts and promotions. This year, we rsquo re seeing retailers bring in inventory at a markedly larger spike compared to 2023 as they gear up for higher demand and strong sales. nbsp When it comes to performance across sectors, department stores, apparel amp electronics 32.9 YoY , and home improvement 24.4 YoY were top performers in June. Grocery amp Superstores and Discount Retailers amp Wholesalers also jumped 22.1 and 13 YoY respectively. We rsquo re seeing particularly strong momentum in brick-and-mortar retail as these stores anticipate a very strong summer peak season. For example, department stores, electronics, and apparel retailers with brick-and-mortar locations saw a 13.8 jump heading into July, representing a 33 YoY climb. Motive predicts retailers will need to change inventory management strategies by the 2024 holiday season Data from the St. Louis Fed reveals that retailers are continuing their low-inventory approach and waiting to bring inventory into stores. As we shared last month , generationally low freight costs have allowed stores to restock at the last minute in response to demand. The latest data shows that inventory-to-sales ratios remain stable at 1.28, signaling that retailers are more accurately predicting demand after the volatility of the last few years. But just as we have seen ocean rates rise recently, we anticipate trucking rates will increase in the second half of this year. This will, in turn, force many retailers to adjust their inventory management strategy, holding on to more inventory longer as later restocking becomes more expensive. We expect to see this change take hold by the holiday season. Motive predicts consumers will see increased prices by Q2 of next year Higher trucking rates will also impact consumers , as some retailers will likely need to start passing higher logistics costs to consumers by the end of Q1 or early Q2 next year. How companies have approached their inventory strategy up to this point will partially dictate this. Those who over-committed to a low-inventory strategy i.e., last-minute restocking while the spot market was cheap and there was excess capacity will feel a greater shock and be forced to raise prices sooner. Retailers with more diversified and flexible inventory strategies will likely fare better. nbsp Freight recession continues to fade as trucking growth begins to resemble 2019 rates and trucking jobs stabilize growth will hit net positive by Q4 In June, 7,621 carriers entered the trucking market, which is 10 less than in May but in line with typical decreases we see for this time of year. The percentage of new carriers 2.1 is similar to June 2019 2.25 , indicating more stable growth. 1,972 carriers left the market in June, a 60 increase from May, but still 58 fewer exits than in December 2023, indicating a strengthening market. Overall, Q2 saw half as many carrier exits 4,039 compared to Q1 8,400 . nbsp We anticipate fewer exits next month and for this more stable growth to continue. We maintain our prediction that the market will see net-positive growth by Q4. Summary Rising trucking rates, trucking transportation job stability, and what we predict to be a very strong July across retail sales, especially brick and mortar, are all pointing to a rebounding freight market. We predict this momentum will continue through the summer, and will be closely following what it means for carriers, shippers, and consumers in the coming months.

            "Field service workers face threats from vehicle accidents, chemical exposure, and equipment dangers. Discover the risks and learn how to protect your workers.\n",
            "Chemical exposure and run-ins with equipment are common risks, but don rsquo t underestimate the potential for vehicle-related accidents. Services like electrical repair, pest control, and landscaping keep homes safe, clean and green. But these professions are more dangerous than many realize. Every day, field service workers fall victim to electrocution, chemical exposure, and slips and falls. Between 2011 and 2021, the landscaping industry lost 1,072 people in work-related accidents . And that rsquo s not the only startling statistic. nbsp 431 installation, maintenance, and repair workers died on the job in 2022, making this the third most deadly line of work. Only transportation and construction had more fatalities. nbsp 222 grounds workers lost their lives in 2022 mdash mostly due to falls, chemical exposure, electrocution, and tree-trimming incidents. nbsp Even electricians weren rsquo t exempt, with 75 of them dying on the job. Protect your people with Motive s Ultimate Guide to fleet safety. Transportation risks in field service lurk in plain sight The vast majority of work-related fatalities in field service result from factors like those listed above. Despite these dangers, transportation incidents pose a bigger threat in field service than one might expect. nbsp Of the 75 electricians who suffered fatal injuries in 2022, 12 died in transportation incidents 16 . In landscaping, the leading cause of fatal injury comes not from chainsaws or mowers, but from workers being struck by vehicles. Even in pest control, where workers face countless safety and health hazards , traffic accidents pose the biggest risk . In fact, half of all respondents in a recent Pest Control Technology survey said they rsquo ve been involved in an accident while driving their service vehicle. nbsp None of this should come as a surprise. After all, transportation incidents are the leading cause of death for commercial workers in the United States. nbsp A worker dies from a work-related injury every 96 minutes , and transportation incidents account for 38 of all occupational fatalities. nbsp Of nearly 5,500 work-related deaths in 2022, more than 2,000 of them occurred in transportation incidents. nbsp So while other risks may be top-of-mind for field service operators, vehicle accidents continue to pose a serious threat. Key takeaways Field service professions are among the most deadly , with installation, maintenance, and repair work ranking third in fatalities utility work ranks sixth. In sectors like pest control and landscaping, traffic accidents are the leading cause of death. While some businesses view safety as an added expense, the costs of inaction are often much higher. nbsp Fleets that use AI-enabled platforms report a decline in unsafe driving behaviors, leading to better performance and lower costs. Safety technology offers a way out of this epidemic. Nonetheless, Motive rsquo s State of Safety Report shows that many fleet leaders are underinvested in safety technology, whether for commercial vehicles or job sites. Some are even ldquo drastically underinvested. rdquo Ninety-five percent of commercial businesses say safety is a priority, but it rsquo s not their top priority. When asked to rank priorities from a list of options, respondents ranked increasing revenue 1 and minimizing expenses 2 higher than improving safety 3 . The costs of inaction Some businesses believe that investing in a driver safety program is too costly in the face of so many other expenses. However, research shows the opposite is true. Costs actually add up faster without a driver safety program in place. According to the National Safety Council , a single, fatal motor vehicle collision costs 1.8 million , on average. As accidents increase, insurance rates often rise. In fact, premium costs per mile have risen 47 in the last decade as lawsuits and nuclear verdicts have soared. Leveraging AI for better fleet safety With the help of artificial intelligence AI , field service businesses can protect workers and prevent these astronomical costs. Motive rsquo s State of Safety Report shows that businesses with world-class driver safety programs experience fewer accidents and safety incidents, lower insurance premiums , and higher driver retention rates. And though some companies worry about driver pushback, businesses that deploy dual-facing AI dash cams actually retain more employees in the long run, not less. In fact, fleets using dual-facing cameras saw a 3 increase in driver retention after 75 weeks when benchmarked against road-facing dash cam users. See how our AI can benefit your business We rsquo re living in a new age, where AI is changing the way field services operate. The arrival of AI in field service has made processes faster and easier, improving the daily experience for both technicians and customers. But as you celebrate the impact AI is having on productivity, don rsquo t overlook its potential to improve safety performance on the road. Tree service provider Xylem Kendall didn rsquo t overlook AI rsquo s potential, and they rsquo ve reaped the benefits. With about 3,000 assets, including bucket trucks and chippers, Xylem Kendall was looking for a way to prevent vehicle rollovers. They found it in Motive rsquo s AI-powered platform .

            "At a time when accidents are increasing and roads are becoming more dangerous for commercial workers, fleets need reputable safety leaders who can make an impact. A lot goes into developing great safety leaders, but becoming fleet safety certified is one way to set yourself apart. ldquo Becoming certified in fleet safety can help protect your business, rdquo says David O rsquo Neal of Scopelitis Transportation Consulting , a Certified Director of Safety CDS and former instructor for the Arkansas Trucking Association. ldquo Certification is a pretty good indicator of someone rsquo s commitment to the craft. rdquo In this article, we rsquo ll discuss what it means to be fleet safety certified, how to go about it, and the many benefits certification brings. Ready to take your safety program to the next level? Download our Ultimate Guide to fleet safety today. What is lsquo fleet safety certified rsquo ? People who are fleet safety certified have completed a series of fleet safety courses and taken an important step in their professional development. Safety professionals often rely on their reputations to further their careers. However, once you leave your community, your reputation may not travel with you. Getting certified catapults you into a national community where your skills are instantly recognized and valued. Certification offers an objective measure of your ability and performance. It shows you ve been tested against a universal standard and have a level of professionalism that others can trust. mdash Jeff Arnold, executive director of the North American Transportation Management Institute NATMI , whose certification programs are considered the gold standard for transportation professionals. Why certification matters North American roads are safer now than they were in the past, but for workers, roads are getting more dangerous. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that a worker dies in a work-related injury every 96 minutes, and transportation incidents account for 38 of all occupational fatalities. nbsp Motive rsquo s Ultimate Guide to fleet safety shows that fleets with world-class safety programs actually reduce these risks. Stats like these show how important fleet safety certifications are to improving performance. nbsp How to get fleet safety certified Becoming fleet safety certified is a straightforward process, though not necessarily an easy one. Before starting a program, safety professionals should acquire a certain amount of safety experience, which varies depending on the program. Next, they must complete courses led by an experienced fleet safety instructor. The courses typically last from a few days up to a couple of weeks, with an average length of one week. Fleet safety training varies from program to program, with several programs to choose from. While some fleet safety professionals are looking to brush up on their skills or keep up with the latest trends, others are looking to take their career to the next level. nbsp Whatever your reasons for becoming fleet safety certified, reputable programs like those below offer something of value. North American Transportation Management Institute NATMI For fleet safety professionals wondering How do I get fleet safety certified , NATMI rsquo s Certified Safety Supervisor CSS and Certified Director of Safety CDS classes are well-known in the transportation industry. Safety professionals must complete the appropriate NATMI course then pass an exam. Courses last from a few days up to a week, and can be completed in person or online. Fleet safety certification cost varies depending on the program. Safety topics on the agenda include Fleet safety program objectives Record keeping and DOT requirements Hours of service violations Reporting and documenting accidents Reducing accidents and injury Identifying trends and root causes nbsp NATMI rsquo s course is designed by volunteer technical committees composed of industry subject matter experts. When the course ends, attendees take the exam. However, the real work begins after the exam, when attendees must provide 17 pieces of evidence documenting their experience and expertise. nbsp Submissions include Signatures from HR and a manager verifying job description and responsibilities Examples of management activities performed Data showing an ability to reduce accidents and injuries Proof of experience nbsp Letters of reference Once professionals complete the course, they have about 60 days to gather the supporting documentation and submit the application. nbsp ldquo If you ask anybody who has become fleet safety certified What s the hardest part ? they rsquo ll inevitably say the application, rdquo Arnold says. ldquo Somebody can take the classes and pass a test, but that doesn t necessarily mean they know how to apply knowledge on the job. So that last piece is pretty important. rdquo OSHA Academy Through the OSHA Academy program , fleet safety managers can get certified in safety courses such as the 48-hour safety and health manager program and fleet safety management . nbsp The courses cover important topics such as Deploying effective safety management systems Hiring best practices Vehicle maintenance and inspection Reducing accident costs and liability Incentivizing and rewarding drivers OSHA offers courses for safety professionals in oil and gas, construction, commercial transportation, and the public sector, with a series specially geared toward safety supervisors and managers .

Certification benefits While becoming fleet safety certified helps safety professionals advance their careers, it also sets higher safety benchmarks for the industry. nbsp nbsp ldquo For individuals, safety certification has a lot of benefits, rdquo says O rsquo Neal. ldquo Often, it rsquo s a requirement to get promoted, such as when a safety supervisor is looking to become a safety director. Other times, it may be tied to a salary increase or be part of the hiring criteria. rdquo For individuals, a fleet safety certification Improves managerial excellence Enhances professionalism Promotes national and international recognition Improves credibility in the courtroom Being fleet safety certified has benefits for the employer as well. It enhances safety knowledge and expertise throughout the business, especially in driver safety and fleet management . Executives are happy to invest in safety certification if they believe it will serve the company. ldquo Before an employee becomes fleet safety certified, the CEO is going to ask, lsquo What is certification going to buy me? rsquo rdquo Arnold says. nbsp To answer that question, NATMI surveyed safety directors who went through their program. The results were overwhelmingly positive. 87 were more compliant after certification 86 reduced accident rates 83 achieved a lower occupational injury rate 80 implemented policies and procedures that reduced accident frequency and severity along with costs ldquo People coming out of these courses are able to go back to their businesses and implement programs and policies that address the root cause of their biggest safety challenges, rdquo Arnold says. ldquo So certification holds a lot of value for businesses as well as individuals. rdquo Improve fleet safety with Motive Professionals who are fleet safety certified know that safety technology is integral to improving performance.

            "Artificial intelligence AI uses computers and machines ldquo to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind, rdquo according to IBM . AI can create art, compose music, even detect signs of cancer . In the world of commercial transportation, AI is changing the way fleets operate by enhancing safety , boosting productivity, and reducing costs. AI dash cams , in particular, help fleets cut costs and become more profitable. Here are three ways they rsquo re doing it. How fleets improve profitability using dash cams 1. AI dash cams help reduce collision costs. Speeding, fatigue, driving under the influence. They rsquo re all major causes of collisions on U.S. roadways. But one cause routinely tops the list distracted driving. nbsp The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration estimates that distracted driving claims more than 3,000 lives per year. And according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control , a collision at work involving distraction costs an employer 100,310 on average. That rsquo s without a non-fatal injury. When a serious injury or fatality takes place, costs soar well above that. By using AI dash cams, commercial fleets can prevent accidents and their associated costs, including the ultimate cost of human life. nbsp We rsquo ve seen it before. Drivers texting, talking on the phone, reaching for lunch in the passenger seat. Everyday distractions like these are dangerous enough in a car. And when they occur in heavy vehicles like a bulldozer or semi, the risks are several times greater. AI dash cams use artificial intelligence to identify and stop distracted driving in its tracks. The Motive AI Dashcam , for example, captures texting, close following, and other high-risk habits on video. It then alerts the driver to these behaviors instantly. In this way, AI puts the operator rsquo s focus where it belongs mdash on the road. In Three Technologies Creating Safer Roads , Forbes explains why AI dash cams like Motive rsquo s are so adept at recognizing and preventing unsafe driving patterns. ldquo The use of predictive AI coaches the driver in real time, delivering in-cab alerts when unsafe behaviors or road conditions are detected, then coaching the driver to self-correct. rdquo nbsp While safeguarding lives is the main objective of an AI dash cam, tools like these also minimize collision costs and help fleets avoid costly litigation. 2. AI dash cams help improve employee retention. Industries like construction, distribution, and trucking have faced labor shortages in recent years, and hiring skilled talent has been a challenge for all of them. Construction lost more than 1 million jobs during the pandemic shutdown , and frontline workers chose early retirement over the supply chain crisis. Through it all, AI dash cams solidified their place among the best driver retention tools. Employee retention is the bedrock of profitability. With so little young talent to draw from, fleets can hardly afford to let operators go. Consider the costs involved in recruiting, onboarding, and training new drivers, and it rsquo s easy to see why retention is the more profitable choice. AI dash cams, like the one from Motive, capture video clips of unsafe driving events, creating a golden opportunity for video-based coaching . With a Motive AI Dashcam in your toolbox, you won rsquo t have to go looking for qualified drivers because you rsquo ll better cultivate the ones you have. When firms incorporate AI into their video coaching, ldquo the learning journey can be unique to each participant, rdquo writes Training Industry Magazine . ldquo The chance to practice skills and processes in a safe space helps set workers up for success, which can increase efficiency and decrease turnover. rdquo Sometimes, an unsafe event requires more education than automated coaching can provide. That rsquo s when safety managers can arrange for an in-person video coaching session between a driver and driving coach. The coach and driver can review the dash cam video clip together and discuss why the event happened. Coaching sessions like these allow coaches to build rapport with their people. They also let drivers grow into their jobs. 3. AI dash cams help protect against fraudulent claims. ldquo If you want to have a recording to show that you weren t at fault after getting into a vehicular accident, adding a dash cam to your vehicle is a great idea. rdquo So writes Forbes in the article The best dash cams will give you an extra set of eyes on the road . The magazine goes on to say, ldquo It rsquo s also better to have a dash cam in operation before it rsquo s actually needed. Most people wait until after they rsquo re involved in an incident to get one, often wishing they had purchased one sooner. rdquo That rsquo s certainly true for the many fleets that have been victimized by hit-and-runs or swoop-and-squat scams , where perpetrators, hoping for lucrative insurance payouts, intentionally cause accidents. With the Motive AI Dashcam, all the proof that fleets need to exonerate innocent drivers and avoid expensive payouts comes in the form of high-definition video. HD video verifies, in the clearest image possible, if an incident occurred, and if so, who rsquo s responsible. The Motive AI Dashcam calls up HD video from anytime in the last 68 to 104 hours, so fleet managers can learn what happened. The best fleet dash cams ldquo The best dash cams record video at a high resolution, capture clear footage during the day or at night, record what rsquo s happening in front of and behind your vehicle , plus offer local and cloud-based storage of recorded content, rdquo Forbes writes.

            "Being distracted for just five seconds at 55 mph is like driving the length of a football field with your eyes closed. AI dash cams are essential for detecting unsafe behaviors like distracted driving, alerting drivers to risky habits that endanger their lives and the lives of motorists around them. However, achieving desired results depends on the accuracy of the technology, which can mean the difference between preventing an accident and dealing with its aftermath. In 2023, 44,450 people died in traffic accidents, and the average cost of a fatal commercial accident was 3.6 million . Failure to accurately detect these behaviors puts drivers rsquo lives at risk and results in significant financial loss. Motive rsquo s guide provides step-by-step instructions and templates to help you set up a side-by-side evaluation of your top dash cam providers. You rsquo ll learn how to 1. Define success metrics Assess the number of accurate alerts and false positives. 2. Define unsafe behaviors Identify the behaviors that pose the most risk to your fleet, such as cell phone usage, close following, and stop sign violations. 3. Set up a fair, controlled test Control variables like hardware condition, installation, and camera placement. 4.

            "To run a safe, productive, and profitable business, physical economy leaders need full visibility into all facets of their operations. Motive rsquo s recent Physical Economy Outlook report discovered that many companies struggle to achieve this comprehensive view due to fragmented data and disparate tools. One in three leaders said they lack the visibility necessary to perform their roles effectively, and many attributed this challenge to outdated tools and multiple systems, which complicates data management and drains resources on manual activities. nbsp There is one area of operations in particular where leaders say they consistently over-invest valuable resources on laborious manual tasks mdash nbsp Spend Management . Spend Management refers to the controlling, optimizing, and monitoring of fleet-related expenses and often relies on tools like fleet cards and reporting systems. However, not all Spend Management solutions are efficient. Many leaders find their teams spending countless hours on expense tracking, spend reporting, and legally required IFTA reporting . Additionally, significant time is lost dealing with frequent phone calls from drivers trying to resolve fleet card problems. To overcome these issues, leaders are now seeking solutions that pull their spend and fleet management together into a single system. A single view of data and reporting Most physical economy leaders have a fleet management platform they use to monitor and improve the safety and operations of their vehicles, like Motive . By using a fleet card that allows spend to be managed from that same platform, teams gain a single view of all their data and reporting in one system. This allows for accurate, quick, and efficient Spend Management, reducing hours previously spent piecing together data and performing match-backs and reconciliations across different systems. nbsp Time savings also apply to IFTA reporting. By centralizing all fuel spend in a single system, filing IFTA reports, which previously took hours, can now be completed in seconds. Productivity savings mount up Having spend and fleet management sit within the same platform also allows for granular fleet card spend controls that help leaders reduce spend and even prevent fraud. Not only that, but the single system provides drivers with visibility into their spend limits, fleet card decline reasons, and other fleet card-related settings, empowering them to resolve many fleet card issues independently and reducing the need for office staff to troubleshoot. With fleet and spend under one roof, reporting and expense tracking is simplified and the burden on office staff is reduced, ultimately driving greater productivity and profitability.

            "Investing in an AI-powered safety solution can be a significant expense, but the return on investment ROI from smarter fleet management is substantial. By reducing accidents and claims, road-facing and driver-facing cameras can save your business money. Here are some of the biggest ways you rsquo ll benefit from implementing AI dash cams . Fewer accidents Through real-time monitoring and alerts, AI dash cams can reduce unsafe driving habits and prevent accidents. The biggest benefit of AI dash cams lies in their ability to Enhance safety Provide real-time monitoring and feedback, alerting drivers to potential hazards and promoting safer driving habits. Prevent accidents Help reduce accidents by detecting unsafe driving behaviors and minimizing distractions. Help drivers improve Recorded footage from AI dash cams can be used for driver training, allowing drivers to learn from their mistakes and improve their skills. Reduced claim expense and exposure Crashes are expensive. They result in direct costs such as vehicle repairs, medical expenses, and potential legal fees. Indirect collision costs include increased insurance premiums, downtime, and loss of reputation. After an accident, the insurance provider may not be willing to renew your policy, regardless of the premium. Investing in a safety solution can significantly reduce the frequency and severity of crashes while ensuring that your safety program is well managed. Lower insurance premiums Insurance companies finance risk. You have to give them an acceptable level of risk to insure or your premiums will rise. If the level of risk in your fleet is too high, you could even be dropped by the insurance provider altogether. For fleets with proven safety records, or those who have invested in AI dash cams or ELDs, many providers offer discounted premiums ranging from 3 to 5 . Better operational efficiency Safety solutions provide real-time insight into driver behavior and vehicle condition, giving fleet managers the data they need to make better decisions and practice smart fleet management. In alerting to unsafe and wasteful habits, such as speeding and aggressive driving , AI dash cams can help reduce vehicle wear and tear and conserve fuel. The recorded data is also invaluable for driver training and reinforcing safe driving habits. nbsp Vehicle diagnostics is another critical feature, because it monitors the condition of vehicles in real-time. Fleets can use vehicle diagnostics to address issues before they lead to breakdowns, downtime, and high repair costs. Optimizing routes and fuel usage are also significant benefits. Real-time data helps identify and reduce unnecessary idling, a major contributor to fuel waste. Implementing policies and technologies to minimize idle time can result in substantial fuel savings. Motive rsquo s system even alerts drivers to less expensive fuel options near their location. Better driver retention A commitment to safety shows drivers that you value their well-being. It can improve driver satisfaction and retention and reduce the costs associated with high turnover. Motive Safety Scores and accurate collision detection don rsquo t just highlight safety trends they allow you to incentivize drivers based on their behavior or improvement. The driver-focused element of Motive rsquo s platform is unmatched. Enhanced reputation A robust safety solution tells brokers, direct shippers, and clients that you operate safely. All fleets make Safety Management System violations and inspections publicly available, along with out-of-service rates, their general safety rating, and even their crash history. A broker first checks to ensure their client s freight is being brokered to the safest, most reliable fleet available. Most brokers won rsquo t ship freight to fleets with a conditional rating or poor safety history. Don rsquo t lose customers and freight because of a poor safety program or record. Smarter Fleet Management Safety amp ROI Overall, AI dash cams can empower fleets to take their dash cams to the next level. Cutting accidents by even a small percentage translates to substantial savings and less downtime. Investing in a safety solution isn rsquo t just about spending money. It s about saving money in the long run. The ROI is clear safer fleets, lower costs, and more efficient operations.

            "One of the biggest hurdles carriers face is ironically the same one that keeps them in business the driver. There rsquo s driver recruiting to worry about, driver qualification, and screening. nbsp Then, once drivers are onboarded, attention shifts to retaining them. One of the biggest things to understand about your team is what motivates them. No fleet is immune to these struggles, but everyone approaches them differently. Challenges starting out During my time at an enterprise fleet, we struggled in many ways. What s worse, everything was on paper. Eventually, technology came along as the savior. We implemented a custom-integrated platform to handle day-to-day driver recruiting and compliance tasks. This allowed us to build out custom training modules to fit our needs from within Tenstreet. Their Driver Insights program was brand new, but it gave us valuable insight into what drivers liked or wanted improved. Up next was visibility , both in and out of the cab. Every time we acquired a new carrier, we acquired a new telematics system. Before you knew it, we ran countless systems without improving our claims frequency or exposure. Building a strong driver safety culture with Motive To control driver behavior and claims, we ended our contract with Samsara and other vendors and implemented Motive. Then, we went to work cultivating a culture of safety and excellence using the Motive Safety Score to create a comprehensive driver coaching , improvement, and recognition program. A safe driver recognition program leverages advanced analytics, including the Motive Safety Score, to assess, coach, and reward drivers for their performance on the road. In a year, we reduced the frequency and exposure of our claims by 40 while increasing man hours by 1 million hours and lowering our OSHA incident rate by a full point mdash something we could never realize in 70 years of operation and countless other vendors. On a personal note, ldquo Wreck it Ralph rdquo was one of our biggest success stories. An old-school driver from Atlanta, he nearly quit because we implemented the dual-facing AI dash cams . But he stayed. And though his initial score under the Motive DRIVE Score was 33, we coached him, and he reached 50. We continued to coach him, and he continued to improve. A year later, ldquo Wreck it Ralph rdquo was one of the best-scoring drivers in the company, with a Safety Score of 94. Now, he won rsquo t drive without a camera. nbsp Motive is so much more than a dash camera or an ELD . The ecosystem of Motive products drives serious improvement. It does so while maintaining fewer vendors, to manage more tasks, in one integrated platform . They even integrated with Tenstreet. The Motive DRIVE Score, now known as the Motive Safety Score, has been upgraded to better evaluate and improve driver safety . The new Safety Score is more comprehensive, and the update was aimed to more accurately reflect driver performance and risk , helping fleet managers focus on key areas for improvement and coaching 8203 . The Motive Safety Score allowed us to pinpoint exactly which drivers to coach and which behaviors to coach on . The evidence-based metric reflects the frequency of unsafe behavior captured by the Motive dash cams and Vehicle Gateways, with fewer events resulting in a higher score. This made it easy to explain score changes to drivers. nbsp The default score assigns weight to behaviors based on their likelihood to cause a collision. However, you can customize behavior thresholds , weights, and performance ranges to focus on the most relevant behaviors. We had more frequent coaching conversations with drivers with lower scores. The value of sound program design When asked which dash cam or ELD vendor is best, I never give an immediate answer. That rsquo s right, Motive is never ldquo always the answer. rdquo While I prefer Motive for larger, more complex operations, smaller fleets and those with diverse or specific needs may not need Motive s vast suite of solutions . Or maybe they do need them and they just don rsquo t realize it. nbsp Regardless, with a safe driver recognition program, there s never a cookie-cutter approach. Assess your needs, and conduct a trial to make a decision. Trial is the keyword. My only advice is to never take things at face value, especially without understanding the added costs that go with each vendor for management and admin costs. Our driver improvement and recognition program was structured to incentivize safe driving practices and support continuous professional development for drivers. It was focused on a ldquo Coach not Cop rdquo approach, and here rsquo s how it worked Recognition and reward the carrot To encourage and celebrate safe driving, the program featured various recognition levels Monthly and quarterly awards Drivers who achieve the highest Safety Scores or significantly improve are recognized regularly. These awards can include financial bonuses, certificates, or public acknowledgment within the company. The goal is to provide ongoing motivation and set a benchmark for others. Annual awards At the end of each year, the program culminates in awards for the top performers and most improved drivers across the fleet. These awards recognize consistent excellence and dedication to safety, offering significant rewards and highlighting the achievements of the drivers. Special recognition for safety practices The program also includes awards for specific safety behaviors, such as avoiding accidents or demonstrating exceptional defensive driving . These quarterly and annual awards emphasize the importance of proactive safety measures. Longevity awards Drivers receive bonuses based on their years of service to honor long-term commitment. This not only rewards loyalty but also promotes sustained performance. Comprehensive driver assessment This is why we needed Motive. We had several top-five vendors, all of whom struggled with accuracy in driver behavior and event detection. I was not willing to compromise the program and culture we were building with bad data. Drivers are already skeptical of these systems, so implementing an inaccurate system that attributes erroneous behavior to a driver is wrong. With the Motive Safety Score, you can tailor the scoring system to align with your business priorities. Here rsquo s how Identify which unsafe behaviors you want to track. For example, if you install both road-facing and driver-facing dash cams, you can monitor distractions like cell phone usage. Assign weights to each behavior based on its importance to your business. To exclude a behavior from affecting the score, simply set its weight to zero. Modify performance range definitions to better suit your fleet rsquo s needs and goals. By customizing these elements , you focus on the behaviors that matter most to your operation. Tailored coaching, training, and support While accountability is King, ldquo Coach, not Cop rdquo is key. An iron fist isn rsquo t always necessary. Recognize that improvement is a never-ending process, and that a program like this emphasizes progress, not perfection. nbsp A driver improvement and incentive program offers targets mdash nbsp training modules tailored to specific areas of need. For instance, if drivers frequently trigger events related to speed management, they are trained on the dangers of speeding and maintaining appropriate speeds. This proactive approach addresses current issues and helps prevent future incidents while improving culture and trust in the company. Building a culture of continuous driver improvement Beyond individual recognition, a driver improvement and incentive program aims to strengthen safety culture and encourage continuous improvement within the fleet. Regular communication of results and updates ensures that all team members are engaged and aware of the program rsquo s impact. This transparency helps build trust and encourages a collective commitment to safety. nbsp Additionally, the self-coaching feature on the Motive Driver App demonstrates the company s confidence in drivers, allowing them to view videos of their driving behaviors and take appropriate action to eliminate unsafe behaviors, thereby enhancing the overall safety culture. Implementation and benefits The Motive platform is designed to be seamless and impactful. Starting with a trial period allowed fleet managers to assess the platform and make necessary adjustments. The program rsquo s flexible structure can be adjusted for different fleet sizes and operational contexts. Benefits of the program Enhanced safety The program promotes safer roads for everyone by recognizing and rewarding safe driving. Increased driver engagement Drivers are more likely to engage in positive behaviors when they know their efforts are recognized and rewarded. Reduced operational costs Focusing on safety can lead to fewer accidents and incidents, reducing repair costs and insurance premiums. Improved driver retention Recognition programs can improve job satisfaction and loyalty, reducing turnover. A driver improvement and recognition program offers a comprehensive solution for enhancing fleet safety and fleet management in an industry where safety is paramount. By leveraging the Motive Safety Score and providing ongoing support and recognition, the program helps create a safer, more productive work environment for drivers and fleets. A solution that adapts to your needs When you rsquo re responsible for the safety of hundreds or thousands of drivers, having a solution that adapts to your needs and allows you to focus on the greatest risks is critical for success.

            "The Chevron Doctrine was overturned in June 2024, and it will affect more than just the Oil Gas industry. Learn how this monumental Supreme Court ruling will affect transportation and trucking as well.\n",
            "It rsquo s not often that a Supreme Court decision makes waves in the transportation industry. The most recent court session however, may represent a pebble tossed in a pond that could ultimately build into a wave worthy of what we saw in the Olympic Gold Medal surfing competition. The decision gaining the most attention is what rsquo s been referred to as the ldquo Loper Bright rdquo case . While it deals mostly with seldom-seen aspects of the federal bureaucracy, it could have far reaching impacts for many regulated industries, including transportation. What happened On June 28, 2024, the court released a 6-3 partisan-line decision that surprised many court watchers. After 40 years, the long-held ldquo Chevron Doctrine rdquo was rejected. This principle, in place since 1984, held that courts should defer to a federal agency rsquo s interpretation of sometimes ambiguous laws or statutes. This decision could represent a fundamental change in how rules and regulations are developed and how and when an agency is authorized to issue them. What to know about the Chevron Doctrine According to the Congressional Research Service, over the last 40 years, the federal court system has evoked the Chevron Doctrine more than 18,000 times in siding with, or showing ldquo deference rdquo to, federal agencies being challenged by stakeholders protesting agency action. nbsp Interestingly, the doctrine was created in response to a case brought by Chevron Corp in support of rules created by the EPA. Over the years, however, some have interpreted the doctrine as granting too much power to executive agencies to interpret congressional intent, a power typically reserved for the judicial branch. The doctrine did this by creating a two-part test to determine if an agency appropriately interpreted congressional intent. Step one instructs the courts to determine if Congress directly addressed the precise question at issue. If a statute is unambiguous about the issue, the court must interpret the law as defined by Congress. If ambiguity is present, then the court must proceed to step two, which asks if the agency made ldquo reasonable rdquo interpretations of the statute. If so, the courts should acquiesce or defer to the agency and not substitute their own interpretation. Impacts of the Supreme Court ruling Most transportation industry groups have applauded the court rsquo s decision as a reining in of nbsp administrative overreach ndash predicting it will help to rationalize the rulemaking process. Meanwhile, industry practitioners have raised questions about how and when they might feel the impact of this ruling, and what specific rules, regulations, or policy decisions could be on the chopping block. While the impact of this ruling will undoubtedly be significant, it will not be immediate. That rsquo s because, for the most part, the ruling is prospective and will have the biggest impacts going forward. The U.S. Supreme Court did not instruct federal judges or administrative agencies to conduct a thorough review of the 18,000 decisions that relied, at least in part, on Chevron. nbsp It will change the playbook that rulemakers use to ensure their actions stand up to judicial scrutiny. What rsquo s likely to change more immediately is the way legislators and regulators craft laws and rules, and how they rsquo re litigated in court actions. For its part, when crafting legislation, Congress will need to be more careful and explicit about what and how they rsquo re directing regulators to address an issue. That could mean hiring more staff to help them more fully understand the complex problems they rsquo re looking to solve and draft more specific legislation, outlining the authorities being granted and specific solutions envisioned. Regulators, meanwhile, will need to be more deliberate in dotting every ldquo I rdquo and crossing every ldquo T rdquo . Now under the greatest scrutiny, they rsquo ll need to explain their justifications for an agency action, making sure to apply statutes consistently across the board and demonstrate why their interpretations are necessary, reasonable, and valid. It is in the best interest of Congress and regulators to adapt in this way because in the future, the courts will be playing a far more significant role in interpreting statutes. Preparing for this additional scrutiny will be key if regulations are to survive legal challenges. Unfortunately, this ruling may further slow the already glacial pace at which statutes and rules are developed and implemented. Though frustrating for those advocating for a specific change, this more deliberate process should take some of the political winds out of the rulemaking process, and likely will reduce the regulatory flip- flopping we sometimes see from administration to administration. For those hoping that hours of service, electronic logging devices , medical qualifications or other rules will quickly be rescinded, don rsquo t hold your breath. It will take a long time to sort out the winners and the losers. And on the topic of driver safety , congressional intent has been pretty clear to date.

            "Rear-end collisions are a significant concern for any organization, accounting for 29 of all crashes . These accidents, often caused by distracted or drowsy driving, can lead to severe damage, injuries, and even fatalities. As a safety manager, you re well aware of the challenges these incidents pose, from increased liability to potential downtime and costs. nbsp Forward collision warning systems can be a game-changer, reducing crash rates by 27 and giving drivers crucial time to brake and avoid accidents. However, despite the growing availability of this technology, many vehicles on the road still lack it. Real-time alerts and accurate AI save lives. Monitoring distracted or drowsy driving can be challenging without visibility into the cab. While our latest Drowsiness AI for dual-facing dash cams detects signs of fatigue to help prevent accidents, we rsquo re also addressing the needs of customers with only road-facing cameras through our new Forward Collision Warning AI. This new safety feature, available with all Motive AI Dashcams , accurately detects when your driver approaches another vehicle ahead of them too quickly. By calculating speed, distance, and time to impact, it provides critical alerts that prompt drivers to brake in time mdash whether they rsquo re distracted or drowsy. This added layer of protection is crucial in preventing serious collisions. Safety managers can also receive these alerts, allowing for a thorough review of incidents and targeted coaching for drivers. Protect drivers in common unsafe scenarios. Forward Collision Warning AI is designed to address common scenarios, offering insights that are essential for coaching aggressive driving and recognizing driver responsiveness. For example, drivers get alerted in the following scenarios. Approaching a stationary vehicle When drivers close in too quickly on a stationary vehicle at intersections or in traffic, leaving little time to react and avoid a collision. Unsafe tailgating Following too closely behind a slower-moving or braking vehicle, which can result in a collision if the driver doesn t have enough time to respond. Sudden turn or merge When a vehicle ahead suddenly stops or slows down to turn, requiring the driver to brake and maneuver swiftly to avoid an accident. ldquo We ve had a couple of instances where the Forward Collision Warning alerts have been really handy and saved us from a potential catastrophe, rdquo said Hunter Wilson, fleet administrator at Arrow Glass Industries . ldquo Recently, one of our drivers had just gone through an intersection after the light turned green. He was about to go under a bridge when traffic suddenly stopped. He was distracted, on his phone, and had to slam on his brakes when the alert went off, barely missing the car ahead. Situations like this not only give drivers a crucial heads-up, but they also provide fleet management with valuable insight into what s happening on the road. rdquo A proven solution for reducing accidents. Since adopting Motive, customers have reported a 57 reduction in accidents within just four months , underscoring the effectiveness of accurate AI and real-time alerts in enhancing fleet safety.

            "To combat driver fatigue for commercial drivers and those in physically demanding roles, Motive is excited to introduce our new Drowsiness AI technology.\n",
            "Driver fatigue poses a serious threat to your organization rsquo s safety, contributing to nearly 100,000 accidents, 800 fatalities, and 50,000 injuries annually. It can lead to dangerous situations like lane merging mishaps, veering off the road, or crossing into oncoming traffic. These scenarios often result in negative traffic outcomes, such as a driver falling asleep and causing a fatal crash . We understand that many of you face similar challenges, especially those with 24 7 operations or drivers in physically demanding roles. Preventing accidents hinges on detecting unsafe behaviors and alerting drivers in real-time. Real-time alerts save lives To combat driver fatigue, we re excited to introduce our new Drowsiness AI. Available with dual-facing AI Dashcams , this technology accurately detects both early and late signs of drowsy driving, including Frequent yawning The dash cam alerts drivers who yawn repeatedly in a short period, advising them to pull over if they re struggling to stay awake. It also triggers an alert if the driver is distracted and starts yawning. Eyes closed If a driver begins to close their eyes and fall asleep, an in-cab alert aims to wake them before a serious collision. This feature is expected in late Q3 2024. As a safety manager, you also receive these alerts, allowing you to quickly contact your drivers and recommend taking a break. If this issue persists, you may want to consider adjusting the driver s schedule. The Drowsiness AI feature has really helped our drivers, who are often on the road alone for hours at a time, rdquo said Hunter Wilson, fleet administrator at Arrow Glass Industries . ldquo The feature acts like a partner, alerting them when they might be dozing off, and that rsquo s something they might not always notice. One driver mentioned that the camera started beeping at him when he was yawning, just as he began to feel sleepy. Thanks to that alert, he was able to pull over at a gas station and take a break to get back on his route refreshed. rdquo Wilson also highlighted the usefulness of Motive rsquo s upcoming ldquo Eyes Closed rdquo detection ldquo Being able to detect eyes closed is huge. Sometimes you think you rsquo re fine to keep driving, even when you rsquo re really not. That alert can be the difference between getting to your destination safely, or having a much more negative outcome. Since drowsiness is assessed over extended periods, we plan to incorporate more fatigue indicators like increased blink rates, frequent lane swerves, abnormal speed fluctuations, and drooping of the head or shoulders. All of these will contribute to a Cumulative Fatigue Index CFI for better fatigue measurement and management. Using generative AI to accelerate model deployment To bring accurate AI models to you faster, our R amp D team uses the latest generative AI technology. Because real-world data on behaviors like yawning and closing eyes can be limited, generative AI bridges this gap. It simulates these behaviors using anonymous driver faces, allowing us to train our models more effectively and ensure reliable performance. Dual-facing dash cams critical to reducing drowsy driving Research from the American Transportation Research Institute ATRI shows that fleets without dual-facing dash cams DFDCs face increased accident liability. Monitoring in-cab behavior enables your organization to better coach drivers on drowsy and distracted driving. While some drivers may initially resist DFDCs, long-term studies by Motive show they do not negatively impact driver retention. In fact, fleets with DFDCs often retain drivers longer, as they appreciate the benefits of exoneration and reduced time dealing with safety incidents. Since adopting Motive, customers have reported a 57 reduction in accidents within four months of deployment.

            "Look beyond the initial cost of telematics and find the right partner for the most effective installation, training, and more.\n",
            "Whatever kind of fleet you rsquo re operating, integrating and managing telematics systems isn rsquo t easy. After all, you re taking a complex project and optimizing it through automation to reduce costs and error. While streamlining, automating, and improving these processes and systems may initially sound like a great idea, depending on the vendor you choose, it may end up costing you. nbsp A lot can go wrong when your telematics vendor doesn rsquo t support you . The real cost of telematics ownership extends far beyond the initial price tag. Many fleets overlook the costs of installation, training, administration, downtime, and more. nbsp In this article, we rsquo ll explore why going with the wrong telematics vendor could cost you, and how to invest with a partner who supports you every step of the way. Installation and integration challenges When installing telematics systems , I once ran into hurdles related to communication and compatibility. Certain systems require additional wiring harnesses to throttle communication between their devices and the vehicle s engine control module ECM . nbsp This complexity increases installation costs and causes operational issues, such as forcing interlock, which locks vehicles in park and requires investing with third parties to resolve. Ultimately, you have to buy a new wiring harness to throttle communication between the device and the ECM. The downtime associated with these problems can be costly. They often result in lost time and money. Ease of installation is crucial to minimizing costs. Systems that offer hassle-free setup are a major asset. Training costs and ease of use Training is another consideration. Motive is known for its ease of use, making training easier. Not all systems are so effective. A complicated system, or one that requires extensive training, can quickly kill any potential cost savings. The time and expense required to train drivers and administrative staff on complex systems add up. User-friendly interfaces and intuitive designs reduce the learning curve, allowing for quicker adoption and more efficient use of the system. Administrative and management burdens Once Motive is installed, the administrative and management expenses become apparent. Poor reporting structures often plague telematics systems, leading to wasted labor and the need for additional software solutions like Tableau. The importance of having practical, day-to-day reporting is significant even for high-level reporting needs and large businesses. Systems that efficiently show data trends on driver behavior, vehicle condition, hours of service, and DVIRs can cut administrative costs by providing the right data exactly when it rsquo s needed. Producing inaccurate data and then being unable to structure or manage it is even worse. The drawbacks of inaccurate AI detection Accuracy in AI detection is a cornerstone of an effective telematics system. Inaccurate AI detection misrepresents driver behavior and imposes hidden costs. For instance, manual monitoring is necessary to review and validate events if the system fails to detect driver behavior correctly. This process increases labor costs and delays the ability to coach and train drivers effectively. Driver trust is undermined when the system inaccurately attributes unsafe behaviors to them. An accurate AI detection system is crucial for rolling out incentive programs and maintaining driver buy-in. Imagine a system so inaccurate that it tells your driver they rsquo ve had a collision five seconds after the collision took place. What rsquo s the point? Inaccurate AI can lead to disastrous consequences, including increased accident risk. Delayed or missed notifications of poor driver behavior, distraction, or close following, for example, can result in crashes that could have been prevented. nbsp Failure to warn drivers about near collisions and other hazards undermines the safety benefits of telematics systems . In my experience with telematics, I rsquo ve seen that other systems are often in the 60 th percentile of accuracy, while Motive has been in the 90 th percentile. nbsp Known for their superior AI detection, Motive ensures that drivers receive timely and accurate warnings. As a result, they can take immediate corrective action that enhances safety and reduces accident rates. Systems with poor AI detection capabilities fail to provide these critical warnings, potentially leading to costly accidents and compromised fleet safety. The impact of poor customer service Customer service and support are vital components often overlooked when assessing the cost of telematics ownership. Poor customer service can lead to extended downtime, higher operational costs, and frustrated users. Efficient support is essential for quickly replacing faulty equipment and minimizing vehicle downtime. Vendors like Motive, with a strong focus on customer success, provide excellent support and training , ensuring the system s optimal use and reducing long-term costs. Evaluating functionality and compatibility When selecting a telematics vendor , it rsquo s crucial to evaluate system functionality and compatibility. Ensure the telematics system integrates smoothly with existing vehicle systems without causing operational issues. Look for telematics that help reduce crashes, unsafe driving behavior, and compliance violations. nbsp Motive rsquo s electronic DVIRs , for example, can add work orders and satisfy FMCSA regulations with three electronic signatures. This streamlines operations, reduces administrative burdens, and facilitates and enhances communication between the frontline driver and the maintenance and operational management teams. Connectivity and reliability considerations Connectivity and reliability are key for effective tracking and ELD compliance . Systems with superior connectivity, such as Motive rsquo s Bluetooth capability, perform better by maintaining data integrity even when wireless service is lost. Accurate real-time detection and warnings for issues like forward collisions and speeding are also crucial. nbsp Inaccurate detection can lead to accidents, higher costs, and more liability. Another consideration is the accuracy of fleet tracking . Is it in real time or is there a delay? Fleets don rsquo t always have complete visibility into their assets, nbsp so understanding where they are and what condition they rsquo re in is vital. Real ROI and looking beyond the initial price tag A comprehensive telematics system should streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve safety. However, it rsquo s essential to consider the total cost of ownership, including installation, integration, and nbsp training. Evaluating these factors ensures the selection of a telematics vendor that meets your needs and delivers real ROI through better efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced safety. Motive stands out with its superior connectivity, accurate AI detection, and ease of use. When looking for long-term, durable, and customer-focused solutions, carefully assess your needs. Conduct thorough trials. And understand the hidden costs so you can select the best system for your fleet.Finding the right telematics vendor isn rsquo t just about the initial cost. It rsquo s about the long-term benefits and efficiencies that the right system can bring to your operations. Buy a real solution from a partner focused on customer success. Avoid the sales machine pushing a product that will cost you big in the long run.

            "Key takeaways nbsp The complexity and sheer volume of problems faced by businesses with physical operations can rsquo t be solved by people alone. AI can help, and many leaders either rely on the technology today or believe it will revolutionize their operations soon. Computer vision can be broadly applied to challenges beyond driver safety. While AI s potential in the digital economy gets a lot of attention, the physical economy ndash which consists of businesses that build our infrastructure, grow our food, transport goods, and supply energy to our homes ndash could benefit even more. Industries like transportation, logistics, construction, energy, field services, and delivery often struggle with limited visibility into their operations due to fragmented data and disconnected tools. These sectors face challenges that are simply beyond human capacity at scale. Consequently, leaders are frequently caught up in crisis management, attempting to maintain control and efficiency over million-dollar fleets and equipment, while also dealing with rising accidents and workplace injuries. These businesses need technology that can handle problems at scale, help automate and improve tasks that are traditionally done manually, and make their work safer, more productive, and more profitable. AI is the answer. In the Physical Economy Outlook 2024 , Motive surveyed 1,000 leaders in physical operations and found a strong belief that AI will revolutionize their operations in the coming years. Many leaders rely on AI to monitor assets and vehicles, optimize resources, and make data-driven decisions. Seventy-six percent of respondents want to use AI to gain crucial visibility across their operations, and 71 are interested in generative AI. However, only 25 are currently using AI, highlighting a significant gap in adoption and a vast opportunity for automation. The survey clearly shows that physical operations leaders are increasingly recognizing AI s potential, with 69 acknowledging its positive impact on their roles. Computer vision is the AI that goes to work for you. Chances are, you rsquo ve heard the term ldquo AI rdquo in the news recently. While AI is impacting our economy in a variety of ways, computer vision is a specific type of AI, and is unique as it can visually verify many things, like analyzing medical images, detecting defects in manufacturing processes, and preventing accidents. It can also help you see and understand what s happening anywhere you have a camera. This can bring significant benefits to safety and efficiency beyond fleets of vehicles, with wide applications across all sectors of the physical economy, including construction, oil and gas, field services, passenger transit, waste services, trucking and logistics, delivery, agriculture, food and beverage, and the public sector. nbsp Computer vision Visual AI in action. Computer vision rsquo s ability to detect and help correct unsafe driving behaviors is well-documented. But it can help businesses off of the road, as well. The following two examples represent just a fraction of the challenges computer vision models can be trained to detect. Compliance and quality assurance. Video is proof. Computer vision can capture video proof so businesses can be confident that proper procedures are followed and that work results in high-quality outcomes. Computer vision can even be used to confirm that customers adhere to agreed-upon rules. In the video below, computer vision is being used to detect and document overflowing trash bins. When clients overfill their bins, it reduces throughput and causes delays. In some cases, drivers may have to end their routes early to dump their load. Using computer vision allows waste services companies to document overfilled bins and automatically send notifications to non-compliant homeowners. Workflows can be built on top of these computer vision models, helping companies automate actions like issuing warnings or fines. Cargo and equipment security. It rsquo s costly and impractical to hire people to watch your yard or trailer full of cargo around the clock. Thieves know this and are taking advantage of the situation. According to CargoNet , cargo theft saw a 33 year-over-year increase in the second quarter of 2024, with the most common theft locations being warehouses and truck stops. nbsp Cargo, vehicle, and equipment theft is a problem across North America, but it rsquo s more prevalent in countries like Mexico, where a vehicle is stolen every 38 minutes . nbsp The stakes are high. People and property are at risk. However, computer vision has the potential to reduce that number significantly. Computer vision can be used to monitor vehicles, cargo, equipment, and job sites and alert you if someone attempts unauthorized access. The video below shows computer vision detecting cargo theft in progress. In this example, the driver and manager would be immediately notified so they can take whatever action they deem necessary. CargoNet estimates that more than 68 million in freight was stolen across all industries between April 1st and June 30th of 2024. So, gaining visibility and being alerted to unauthorized access in real time has the potential to save businesses millions of dollars. The time to act is now.

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the August 2024 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the August edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report. What follows is an analysis of the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform of 120,000 customers during the past month. Motive rsquo s transportation and logistics data is a reflection of consumer demand and therefore, a leading indicator of overall economic stability and trends. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Motive Predictions 2024 will be a stronger holiday shopping season, with higher sales and earlier shopping than 2023. nbsp 2024 will be a record year for Mexican imports to the U.S. as Mexico establishes itself as the top importer until at least 2030. AI demand could fuel more imports from Mexico. The trucking market will hit net-positive growth by November, ending nearly 2 consecutive years of losses. Top Findings Retailers are preparing for strong Q4 sales, with grocery and superstore warehouse visits surpassing 2021 levels, and department stores, apparel, and electronics jumping over 30 year-over-year. Mexico imports are at an all-time high 675K trucks brought a total of 32.5B in goods from Mexico to the U.S. in May. Entrants and exits to the trucking market continue to move in a positive direction. Retailers anticipate stronger and earlier-than-usual 2024 holiday shopping June saw one of the strongest month-over-month jumps to date for retailer restocking , according to Motive rsquo s Big Box Retail Index. The metric, which tracks visits to warehouses of the top 50 U.S. retailers, jumped 10.8 since May, and 16 year-over-year. While these rates typically rise in summer months, this year rsquo s surge indicates retailers are expecting bigger summer sales than last year and we predict they rsquo ll see record sales for the month of July. The 4th of July holiday, Amazon Prime Day, and other retailers rsquo competing promotions are what most likely drove the increase. One of the biggest retail moments of the year, Amazon Prime Day, drives many retailers to run competing discounts and promotions. This year, we rsquo re seeing retailers bring in inventory at a markedly larger spike compared to 2023 as they gear up for higher demand and strong sales. nbsp When it comes to performance across sectors, department stores, apparel amp electronics 32.9 YoY , and home improvement 24.4 YoY were top performers in June. Grocery amp Superstores and Discount Retailers amp Wholesalers also jumped 22.1 and 13 YoY respectively. We rsquo re seeing particularly strong momentum in brick-and-mortar retail as these stores anticipate a very strong summer peak season. For example, department stores, electronics, and apparel retailers with brick-and-mortar locations saw a 13.8 jump heading into July, representing a 33 YoY climb. Record truck border crossings and ground import volumes cement Mexico as 1 U.S. importer amid declining Chinese imports 675K trucks crossed the U.S. Mexico border, bringing 32.5B in goods with it in May of this year, representing a 7.2 increase year-over-year despite the volatility of shipping during that period. These numbers represent all-time records for Mexico-to-U.S. imports and underscore the new normal for U.S. supply chains Mexico is now firmly established as the country rsquo s largest importer. The country has imported more goods than Canada by truck for the last 22 months consecutively. With Chinese imports down 19.9 year-over-year since May 2022, it s clearer than ever that U.S. companies are adopting nearshoring from Mexico as a primary resourcing strategy. nbsp Factors driving this trend include attempts by U.S. companies to diversify supply chains, more protectionist trade policies, and even the types of products being imported. The commodities that have seen the greatest year-over-year growth include computer-related machinery up 20 year-over-year and electrical machinery up 8 . As U.S. companies continue to invest in building AI technology , demand for these materials will likely continue to grow, fueling higher Mexican imports in these areas in the next few years. nbsp nbsp How will the upcoming election impact nearshoring? We think it is unlikely this trend will slow down regardless of the election outcome. While there is speculation that more protectionist trade policies may impact the USMCA, both parties seem likely to continue tariffs on Chinese imports and we predict nearshoring will gain more momentum going into 2025. nbsp Motive predicts 2024 will be a record year for goods crossing the southern border, and, barring any major policy changes following the election, Mexico will remain the top U.S. importer until at least 2030. Trucking entrants and exits move toward equalization as the market begins to recover and we move closer to net positive growth Following a small contraction in June , entrants and exits to the trucking market moved in a positive direction in July. Net exits plummeted to 915, a 53.6 drop from June and a 74 drop year-over-year that marks the lowest levels of contraction since the start of the freight recession in October 2022. New carrier registrations rose 4.5 since June and 3.6 year over year. Similar to last month, increased demand is moving the trucking market toward positive growth and we expect this momentum to continue through the end of 2024. nbsp However, not every indicator in July was positive. Carriers continue to describe the current market as being in a trough and unemployment in trucking rose 0.2 compared to June and 1.9 year-over-year. Despite this, increasing freight demand amid strong consumer spending are continuing to move the trucking market in a positive direction. nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp We anticipate the trucking market will see positive growth for the first time in nearly two years by the end of November. nbsp Summary August paints an overall positive economic picture, with retailers anticipating strong holiday sales and earlier-than-usual consumer holiday shopping.

            "Your employees are the backbone of your business. Their dedication ensures that products hit store shelves, roads and buildings get built, and packages are delivered on time. Your workforce faces constant challenges long periods away from family for those on the road, hazardous conditions for field workers, and too many manual processes for back-office staff. The combination of legacy systems, siloed technologies, and long paper trails makes it difficult to manage your workforce and keep your team moving. It may be hard to believe, but one in five nbsp physical operations leaders are still using pen and paper to manage their operations. One in three say they don t have the visibility needed to perform their jobs effectively. This lack of visibility and control has created untenable levels of operational inefficiency. It s costing physical operations businesses time and money and exposing workers to accidents and injury. Enter Motive Workforce Management. Our newest product creates modern, easy-to-use workflows for dispersed teams. Because it s built on the Motive Integrated Operations Platform , Motive Workforce Management is connected to all Motive offerings by design. Companies can now manage their workers and vehicles in the same system with confidence. Motive s Integrated Operations Platform is designed to make the lives of field workers and the back-office staff safer and more productive. Manage your workforce from anywhere Whether your team starts and ends each day in the yard or on the road, task management is a challenge. Drivers don t always know what they re supposed to do at any given time, and even if they do, they don t always get it done. This leads to problems like lack of compliance , low productivity, or missed communications with customers. Motive s new Walkthroughs feature keeps teams on task and on schedule. Use Walkthroughs to create checklists for drivers and operators in the field. Your workers can use the feature to keep up with tasks throughout the day, managing all of their tasks seamlessly right through the Motive Driver App. As a manager, you can create Walkthroughs for any use case and industry.

That saves you time and money in the long run. All Motive Enterprise subscription customers have access to Walkthroughs. Up-to-date and accessible driver qualification and vehicle documentation Many companies track driver qualification and vehicle documentation on paper. As a result, these papers may get lost in vehicles or hidden in filing cabinets. Outdated digital systems are siloed and difficult to use. This means management teams have no way to proactively manage documents that will soon expire or are missing altogether, putting the company at risk for compliance violations. Even worse, workers on the road often lack access to these documents when they need them, such as during a DOT inspection or after an accident. nbsp With Motive Workforce Management, driver documents and vehicle documents can be stored securely and accessed by everyone who needs them, no matter where they are. Workers can access their personal documents and vehicle-related documents within the Motive Driver App. Workers are automatically alerted to upcoming document expirations, so they can easily work with their back office to update their documents.

            "Brake Safety Week, Aug 25-31, 2024, is crucial for commercial vehicle safety, focusing on brake inspections to prevent violations and ensure properly functioning brake systems.\n",
            "We wrapped up another Safe Driver Week with the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance. Safety never sleeps, so CVSA continues its partnership with regulatory bodies nationwide in their relentless pursuit of road safety with events throughout the year. One of the biggest is the upcoming Brake Safety Week, scheduled for this week, August 25-31, 2024. Brake Safety Week is more than just routine, it s a focused initiative emphasizing brake systems in CMVs. This event is all about maintaining brake systems and components. BrakeSafetyMatters Brake systems are critical for the safe operation of commercial vehicles. In 2023, during the CVSA International Roadcheck, brake system violations accounted for 25 of all out-of-service conditions. The FMCSA 2023 data revealed that six of the top 20 vehicle violations were related to brakes. During last year rsquo s Brake Safety Week, 12.6 of the 18,875 CMVs inspected in the United States were placed out of service due to brake-related issues. In addition, 1,394 vehicles failed inspection due to the 20 defective brakes criteria. This criteria says a vehicle is out of service if 20 or more of its service brakes are defective 8203 . Not all fleet vehicles are equipped with drum brakes. Disc brakes have become increasingly common on CMVs due to their performance compared to drum brakes. They perform better in adverse conditions and are less prone to fading during heavy braking. With all that said, carriers and drivers frequently find themselves out of service for having cracked discs and rotors. This is especially common among motor coaches. Routine brake inspections and maintenance by properly qualified personnel are a must. Properly functioning brakes, and routine brake maintenance, are non-negotiable for safety on the road. What to expect during Brake Safety Week Inspectors will be out in force, focusing on brake lining, pad, disc, and drum violations. The air system is also important applied brake tests, buzzer checks, and checking your tractor protection valves are a daily must. Inspectors will use the CVSA rsquo s North American out-of-service criteria to review CMVs and remove any vehicles with brake-related violations from the road until the issues are resolved. Remember, out-of-service criteria update annually, so if you rsquo re unfamiliar, get a new book from CVSA or get online access. Some jurisdictions will also use performance-based brake testers, which are machines that assess a vehicle rsquo s braking performance. This layer of scrutiny ensures that only vehicles with optimal braking capabilities are on the highway. Education and outreach Education is a core focus of Brake Safety Week. Inspectors, motor carriers, and industry stakeholders engage in outreach activities to raise awareness about brake maintenance. Outreach includes Sharing the inspector rsquo s procedures to help drivers and mechanics understand what to expect. Providing tools and resources, such as checklists for inspecting drums, rotors, brake lining, and pads. Teaching drivers and mechanics about the various components of brake systems that inspectors will check. Tips like these aim to engage drivers, motor carriers, and owner-operators in brake safety. Not only that, they provide mechanics with the knowledge they need to maintain brake systems proactively. DVIR in ensuring vehicle safety Pre- and post-trip inspections by frontline drivers are crucial to a proactive maintenance program. Even more important is a seamless notification and reporting process that notifies management and maintenance of discovered defects. Motive offers an electronic DVIR that enhances the pre-trip and post-trip inspection process for drivers. The electronic DVIR streamlines the process, making it easier for drivers to complete their inspections and report any defects they find. The electronic DVIR allows drivers to annotate defects directly on their mobile devices. This real-time reporting ensures that any issues are immediately communicated to fleet management and maintenance personnel. As a result, defects are addressed promptly, ensuring that vehicles operate safely. Management often doesn rsquo t have daily eyes on their fleet, so they rely heavily on driver inspections and the seamless reporting of defects to ensure safe operation. The electronic DVIR creates a continuous flow of communication, ensuring that management is aware of any issues as soon as they are reported. This system not only helps in maintaining the safety of the fleet but also ensures compliance with regulations 8203 . The integration of electronic DVIRs promotes a culture of safety and accountability within fleets. nbsp What do inspectors do with the data? nbsp Inspectors collect and report data on brake inspections and violations to the CVSA. This data includes specifics on brake linings and pads, rotors and drums, and other equipment, in keeping with this year rsquo s focus. The CVSA will report the findings later this year, providing valuable insight into the state of brake safety across North America. Brake Safety Week is an initiative that enforces compliance. Just as importantly, it educates the industry about the importance of brake maintenance. I cannot stress the significance of this event enough. It rsquo s an opportunity for the industry to step up, ensure that vehicles are safe, and ultimately protect the lives of everyone on the road.\n",

            "Each year, more than 1,000 workers lose their lives to construction accidents, a sobering statistic that continues to rise. The latest figures show fatalities have increased by 11 , with falls, slips, and trips accounting for the biggest share 38 . nbsp Construction is especially vulnerable to a category known as ldquo The Fatal Four , rdquo a group that includes falls, electrocutions, struck-by accidents, and incidents of being caught in or between something. Notably, 45 of ldquo struck by rdquo deaths in construction involve vehicles ndash making transportation incidents the second most fatal category in the industry. nbsp As construction hazards increase, the demand for advanced safety tech grows. Still, Motive rsquo s State of Safety Report shows that many construction firms are underinvested in safety technology. Ninety-five percent of commercial fleets say safety is a priority, but it rsquo s not their top priority. When asked to rank priorities from a list of options, respondents ranked increasing revenue 1 and minimizing expenses 2 higher than improving safety 3 . Get on the road to better fleet safety with our Ultimate Guide. The costs of inaction Firms that don rsquo t invest in safety technology are putting their workers at risk. Yet many still haven rsquo t done it, put off by concerns about financial cost. Research shows costs add up faster withou t a safety program in place. nbsp Fatal injuries in construction cost the United States 5 billion annually , and non-fatal injuries are just as problematic. In 2022, the construction industry had 169,600 recordable cases of injury and illness, the third-highest rate of any industry. In the past year, OSHA violations have cost contractors an average of 4,236 per citation . When safety incidents and OSHA violations occur together, contractors experience a substantial rise in their insurance premiums, adding to the total cost of accidents. According to Construction Dive, nearly 4 of all employer compensation costs in construction went toward workers rsquo compensation claims last year, more than double the average costs for employers in all industries. Leveraging AI for better construction site safety In construction, safety risks are as plentiful as projects themselves. Contractors are turning to artificial intelligence AI as a lifeline. Motive rsquo s Physical Economy Outlook 2024 shows that 72 of construction leaders say AI is crucial to preventing accidents and coaching drivers, more than leaders in trucking 66 and oil and gas 61 . 40 of construction leaders believe AI improves worker safety. 32 say it helps in predicting vehicle and equipment maintenance needs. Meanwhile, Motive rsquo s State of Safety Report shows that contractors with world-class safety programs experience fewer accidents and safety incidents, lower insurance premiums , and higher driver retention rates than other firms. More than half 57 of fleets that use AI dash cams report a decline in unsafe driving behaviors , and 73 believe roads are safer with AI-enabled cameras dash cams. With such promise, construction firms are investing in AI more than any other industry. In fact, AI use in construction accounted for the highest market share of AI investment in North America, with job site safety a central focus. nbsp At Motive, we create technology and educational guides that empower safety leaders to be change agents and make a real impact.

            "In the transportation industry, drivers are getting younger and more inexperienced. Learn how AI-powered technology can improve fleet safety and shape the habits of new drivers.\n",
            "The transportation industry has seen a significant shift in the type of drivers hitting the road. Gone are the days of seasoned, veteran drivers with years of experience and a deep sense of responsibility toward public safety. Today, drivers are younger and less experienced, and their training often falls short of what rsquo s needed for the demanding job of CDL driver . This has brought about the need for advanced technology and new methods to ensure safety in the industry. Motive AI dash cams give fleets real-time visibility into operations and driver behavior. This visibility is the catalyst for identifying areas where drivers need improvement and preventive measures to become better, safer drivers. With these tools, carriers can supplement the initial CDL training that drivers receive, tailoring it to meet the practical needs of everyday commercial vehicle operations. nbsp See the AI Dashcam in action. Adapt training to the modern drive The new driver is different from the traditional drivers of the past. In my experience, I rsquo ve seen how work ethic, responsibility, and experience levels have changed, requiring a different approach to training and monitoring. Today s drivers may lack the life and work experience of their predecessors, so it rsquo s essential to have tools that can help mold them into safe and efficient operators and drive a culture of continuous improvement. Critics with little practical experience in commercial transportation make telematics controversial. One argument is that insurance companies try to price carriers out of business. This is not factual. Fleets provide revenue for insurance companies. Insurance premiums are based on a fleet s safety record, behavior, and regulatory compliance . nbsp Good carriers with fewer violations and better safety ratings will benefit from lower premiums. To save on insurance costs, they may even entertain joining group captives. A captive is an insurance group where members are all self-insured through various funds, then backed typically by a much larger company for excess or catastrophic claims. As member-owners, they can potentially profit from safe performance. nbsp Unleash the power of continuous learning Another complaint is that new drivers permitted to drive vehicles with automatic transmissions are inferior to those allowed to drive manual transmissions, and that rsquo s why we have more crashes. While it rsquo s true that manual transmissions require more focus, which can reduce distraction, the type of transmission has little bearing on overall safety. The key to improving driver behavior lies in continuous monitoring and training, not in the transmission type. Engagement within the transportation industry is vital. So are honesty, responsibility, and self-reflection. Our goal should be to eliminate ignorance and advance dialogue and varied perspectives throughout the community. By community, I mean brokers, carriers, shippers, and vendors alike. We have a broad-based problem where we need to focus on the shared goal of safe operation that preserves life and property while reducing claims. Recognize that safe performance is good for everyone We need to embrace diverse perspectives and foster a community where drivers, carriers, brokers, and other stakeholders can share their insights and experiences. Ignoring valid points or refusing to engage in meaningful discussions is dangerous. The goal should always be to preserve human life, improve safety, and drive continuous improvement . Critics who spread misinformation or refuse to engage in self-reflection and constructive dialogue only harm the industry. Solving these issues means recognizing them, understanding their significance, and working collaboratively toward solutions. It means supporting carriers and drivers by providing honest feedback and practical advice, even when it rsquo s tough to hear. For example, challenging DOT violations can help carriers improve their records and ratings, but it must be done with integrity and a focus on continuous improvement through self-reflection and correction. Suppose a carrier or driver is at fault. In that case, it rsquo s crucial to address the issue honestly and help them understand what went wrong and how to prevent it in the future. Tolerating poor or unsafe performance does a disservice to the entire industry and public safety. The transportation industry is evolving, and so must driver training, monitoring, and engagement. By leveraging AI dash cams, engaging in open and honest dialogue, and focusing on continuous improvement, we can ensure that the new generation of drivers is just as capable and responsible as the old-school generation.

            "Read how Motive s AI Omnicam protects children in school zones and increases accountability for drivers who violate school zone safety laws.\n",
            "It rsquo s back-to-school 2024, and student safety at bus crossings, bus stops, and school zones is a top priority. Accidents occur every year because drivers speed through school zones or fail to stop for school buses. With safety at the forefront, especially for school-age children, Motive rsquo s AI Omnicam can provide 360 deg visibility around school buses. For school bus operators, that makes it easier to enhance student safety and hold reckless drivers accountable. School bus stops and crossings are places where students are most vulnerable. Despite strict laws requiring drivers to stop for school buses with extended stop signs, violations occur every day. According to the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services, more than 95,000 school bus drivers reported more than 80,000 illegal passes in a single day. In a 180-day school year, this equates to more than 14 million violations and a serious risk to our children. Risks, statistics, and the value of cameras The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA states that from 2010 to 2019, there were 1,207 fatal school transportation-related crashes, resulting in 1,327 fatalities. The frequency of these incidents emphasizes the need for heightened awareness and enforcement. Just as importantly, it shows the value of having high-definition video that captures these events in real time, along with a picture of the perpetrator s vehicle and the license plate. In Aspen, Colorado, where bus drivers for the Aspen School District have to navigate two mountain passes and inclement weather, high-definition video has been a vital asset. The school district uses nbsp Motive s dual-facing AI Dashcams nbsp to ensure driver safety every inch of the way, and to respond to local he said, she said incidents with clear-cut proof. To actually have video evidence of an incident really helps us reduce unsafe behavior and liability. We ll always have a lot of risk on our roads, because we re a tourist town. But our own local people drive much more safely around us now because they know we have cameras on board and they ll get caught. Reghan Mahaffey, director of transportation for Aspen School District Mahaffey uses Motive cameras to determine which unsafe behaviors to focus on during driver coaching sessions, or to report unsafe driving by citizens to police. People in town used to run the school bus stop signs during student loading and unloading. Not anymore. Now, Mahaffey has trained her drivers to say the license plate letters and numbers aloud, so the Motive AI Dashcams capture both the audio and video. Violators have been fined and some taken to court. Word has spread in the community about the fail-safes Aspen School District now has in place, and these types of incidents have decreased significantly. In those situations, the AI Dashcams have helped a lot, Mahaffey says, and our local law enforcement actually loves it because they know they can reach out to us and get video anytime something happens near one of our buses. Read the full Aspen School District case study. Leveraging technology for safety Despite the high number of violations around school buses, many offenders aren t caught or penalized. The difficulty in proving these violations, the lack of motivation for bus drivers to report incidents due to past inaction, and challenges for law enforcement in issuing citations all contribute to offenders going unnoticed or unpunished. nbsp The lack of enforcement highlights the importance of technology like Motive s AI Omnicam, which can capture clear and actionable evidence of these violations, increasing accountability and student safety. Motive s AI Omnicam is designed to protect students by providing a 360-degree view of activity around every school bus, every second of the day. With Motive s clear, high-resolution image quality at 1080p, the AI Omnicam is also great at capturing critical details, such as license plates. The AI Omnicam s side-view cameras offer clear, identifiable images of vehicles and drivers who fail to obey bus stop signs. Full visibility ensures that any violations are documented so law enforcement can take swift action.With the AI Omnicam , bus drivers can access critical evidence of any illegal passing incidents, which are crucial to enforcing laws and deterring future violations. Tips for drivers during school season Obey school bus stop signs Drivers must always stop when a school bus has its stop sign extended. It s not just a law, it s the right thing to do to keep our kids safe. Slow down in school zones School zones are marked for a reason. Always reduce speed when driving through these areas, especially during school start and end times. Stay alert and avoid distractions Children can be unpredictable. Stay vigilant, avoid distractions, and be prepared to stop suddenly when driving near schools or bus stops. Minimize the dangers of school bus crossings The safety of our students is a shared responsibility. In leveraging advanced safety technology like Motive s AI Omnicam, fleets can drastically reduce the risks associated with school bus crossings and stops.

            "Learn the top 3 ways to customize your safety program, reduce liability, and protect driver privacy with Motive s flexible, self-serve solutions.\n",
            "As a safety manager, ensuring every driver finishes the day safely is a challenging task. You rsquo re constantly reviewing footage, managing incidents, and coaching drivers who may resist feedback mdash all while under pressure to do more with less. What works for one organization might not work for yours, and a one-size-fits-all safety approach just won rsquo t cut it. That rsquo s where Motive rsquo s fully customizable, self-serve safety solution comes in. With granular control over safety event video capture, in-cab alerts, and Safety Scores, you can tailor your safety program to your company rsquo s specific needs. You decide which events to detect and at what thresholds, allowing you to focus on the biggest risks. nbsp Here are three ways Motive customers customize their safety program to avoid being overwhelmed with safety videos or exposed to unnecessary liability. All while addressing union and driver privacy concerns. 1. Alert drivers in-cab without capturing event video If you rsquo re worried about union resistance to driver-facing cameras or legal concerns about video footage, you can use AI to detect unsafe behavior and alert drivers in real-time mdash without capturing any event videos. This lets drivers self-correct before accidents happen, providing real-time coaching benefits without generating footage that could increase liability. Some organizations opt not to capture in-cab behaviors like cell phone usage or drowsiness to address privacy concerns, while others may turn off event capture entirely. 2. Capture video only if drivers ignore in-cab alerts By setting up in-cab alerts to coach drivers first, you rsquo ll empower drivers to take control of their own performance. If unsafe behavior continues, video is then sent to the Motive Dashboard for manager review and further coaching. This approach allows you to focus on the most critical issues and minimizes legal liability by only capturing footage for behaviors you have time to address. ldquo The ability to take immediate corrective action and to follow up later with coaching empowers Rosendin to reduce driving behaviors that can lead to costly and dangerous incidents. nbsp mdash nbsp Corporate fleet manager at Rosendin Electric. 3. Capture event video without in-cab alerts When rolling out AI Dashcams, your drivers may need time to adjust. Some organizations start by capturing event videos with in-cab alerts turned off, allowing drivers to gradually get used to the technology. Drivers can review safety events in their Motive Driver App and, as they become more comfortable, you can activate in-cab alerts for specific behaviors. This phased approach, or crawl-walk-run deployment , helps ease the transition. ldquo Through effective coaching and better customization, we rsquo ve reduced the number of triggered events by about 70 , rdquo says Cristian Zuniga, telematics site champion at Staker Parson. ldquo Cell phone use has plummeted, along with close following and distraction. Drivers are more alert, and the real-time feedback they get in the cab has been transformative. rdquo Questions to ask your vendor To ensure your vendor can meet your needs, ask these critical questions during your evaluation Can I customize in-cab alerts and video capture directly in the dashboard? Some vendors require their support team to make basic changes mdash make sure you have full control. Do you offer granular control over settings, or am I limited to broad presets? Broad preset options limit flexibility granular slider controls let you fine-tune your program. How flexible is your platform in customizing Safety Scores and behavior thresholds? Ensure you can adjust behaviors, thresholds, and performance ranges to match your company rsquo s unique risks. Address critical risks with a flexible safety solution Your daily challenges as a safety manager demand a flexible, customizable solution. Unlike other platforms that don rsquo t offer self-service customization or limit you to preset options, Motive offers the precision and adaptability you need to minimize risk, empower drivers, and protect privacy. When you rsquo re responsible for the safety of thousands of drivers, having a solution that adapts to your needs is critical for success.

            "Find out how this innovative tech is boosting safety, efficiency, and profitability in industries from pest control to lawn care. Field service businesses, including pest control, tree services, and electrical repair businesses, are critical players in the physical economy. These industries operate under immense pressure to improve efficiency, ensure safety, and reduce risk. nbsp While AI technology has garnered attention in sectors like logistics and construction, a type of artificial intelligence AI called computer vision is beginning to impact field services. Computer vision in this sector isn t new, but its widespread adoption is more recent. Operators in lawn care, electrical repair, tree care, and similar industries rely on computer vision to automate tasks, improve safety, and increase production. Read on to see how field service businesses use computer vision to enhance the visibility, safety, and profitability of their operations. For a deeper dive on how this tech can help your business, get your computer vision guide. What is computer vision? Computer vision is a form of AI that enables machines to interpret and understand visual data from the environment.

            "A look at coverage, compliance, and cost. Managing a fleet, whether for a traditional motor carrier or one in field services or construction, requires comprehensive insurance coverage to protect against various risks. Here s a guide to understanding the essentials of fleet insurance. We ll explore what s behind rising costs, and how compliance impacts not just premiums, but your ability to obtain and renew insurance coverage. Types of fleet insurance Commercial insurance carriers include traditional insurance policies offered by insurance companies, covering liability, physical damage, cargo, and more. The main advantage of conventional insurance is broad coverage, which ensures regulatory compliance and the ability to bundle different types of insurance. However, premiums can be expensive, particularly for fleets with poor safety records. On the other hand, captive insurance , a form of self-insurance, is owned by the captive s insured members. It therefore allows multiple companies to share in the risk and profits, offering the potential for lower premiums, profit sharing, and more control over the insurance program. However, the initial setup costs of a captive program can be high, and there can be some risks, due to captive groups generally needing to be more selective in the members they accept. A risk control assessment is typically required for prospective members to be accepted. Additionally, managing captive insurance can be complex. Self-insurance is another option for fleets with substantial financial resources. In this option, fleets assume all risks and claims themselves. This provides complete control over claims and risk management and can lead to potential cost savings. However, it also involves high financial risk, requires significant reserves, and can be difficult to handle from a regulatory perspective. Ready to reduce your premiums? Get the best results with our comprehensive guide. Coverage for fleets Most traditional motor carriers have a minimum coverage requirement of 750,000, while other modes of transport, like hazmat and passenger fleets, require a higher minimum. Fleet insurance must include several types of coverage to ensure protection Auto liability insurance covers bodily injury and property damage to third parties resulting from vehicle accidents. It s fundamental coverage for all fleets, shielding them from the financial repercussions of accidents. Physical damage insurance protects fleet vehicles against damage from collisions, theft, vandalism, and other perils. This coverage is crucial for maintaining the fleet s operational integrity. Cargo insurance covers goods being transported by the fleet. It ensures that the value of the cargo is protected against loss or damage during transit. Non-trucking liability insurance is essential for owner-operators when not under dispatch. It provides liability coverage for incidents when the truck is used for non-business purposes. General liability insurance covers incidents off the road, such as accidents at loading docks, slips and falls, and other general business liabilities. This coverage protects against a wide range of potential risks not directly related to driving. Workers compensation insurance protects employees from work-related injuries. It covers medical expenses, lost wages, and rehabilitation costs, ensuring compliance with legal requirements and protecting the business from related liabilities. Rising costs of commercial insurance The cost of commercial insurance for fleets is increasing due to several factors . Nuclear verdicts, which are extremely high jury awards in lawsuits, often reach millions of dollars and significantly impact insurance payouts. Broader economic trends and social inflation, where public expectations for compensation rise, further drive up claim costs. These factors contribute to rising premiums and the struggle for insurance companies to turn a profit despite increases. The impact of FMCSA compliance on insurance The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA uses Safety Measurement System SMS scores and Compliance, Safety, and Accountability CSA scores to evaluate fleet safety performance. Poor performance in these areas can severely impact a fleet s insurance premiums and coverage options. nbsp High SMS and Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Category BASIC scores indicate poor safety practices, while a history of frequent violations and crashes, especially preventable ones, can lead to higher insurance costs or denial of coverage. Additionally, carriers with unsatisfactory safety ratings may struggle to find affordable coverage or any coverage at all. Non-compliance with FMCSA regulations, high crash rates, and poor safety scores can lead to increased premiums, difficulty renewing policies, and even being priced out of business. Maintaining compliance and improving safety scores is crucial for managing insurance costs effectively. Enhancing compliance and safety with technology No one wants to shut down due to failure to secure coverage, and no one wants subprime coverage that can cost 30,000 a truck. Leveraging technology helps fleets maintain compliance and improve safety scores, ultimately lowering insurance costs. Motive provides an ecosystem of solutions to help fleets stay compliant and enhance safety. Dash cams provide critical evidence in case of accidents, helping to determine fault while potentially reducing claims. Motive helps ensure vehicles are properly maintained, reducing the likelihood of breakdowns and accidents. Driver Vehicle Inspection Reports DVIRs ensure daily inspections are performed, keeping vehicles safe and compliant. Electronic logging devices reduce driver fatigue by ensuring compliance with hours-of-service regulations.

            "Truck Driver Appreciation Week is a time to recognize the dedication, sacrifices, and hard work of truck drivers who keep our economy moving.\n",
            "Being a truck driver has shaped my life and career in more ways than I could have ever imagined. The perspective that comes from the daily pressures of driving to the grind of logistics is something that helps you in the industry regardless of where you end up in it. Driving a truck gave me a deep sense of purpose, pride, and respect for the industry and those who continued to drive full-time. As we celebrate Truck Driver Appreciation Week, I want to take a minute to talk about what being a truck driver has meant to me and why this week is so important for all drivers. I started trucking 35 years ago on a farm, then commercially 25 years ago, and it wasn t just a job. It was a way of life. From my first run, I experienced the stress and pressure to perform and not just get back alive but also to get the truck back without destroying it or destroying someone or something else. There was also freedom, the responsibility of moving freight and meeting or exceeding expectations, and the satisfaction of getting the job done at all costs. Over time, I realized that driving wasn t just about moving freight. It was about a brotherhood, an often irreverent brotherhood but a brotherhood still. It s a family where we watch out for one another, offer advice, and share life s challenges on the road. It s about the pride of handling something many people may not fully understand. The long hours, the weather, the tight schedules, and most importantly, the moral and ethical responsibility to drive safely for ourselves and everyone else on the road. Why Truck Driver Appreciation Week matters Truck Driver Appreciation Week is our chance to acknowledge drivers incredible contributions every day. It s a reminder that, without these dedicated men and women, the shelves at our grocery stores would be empty, the materials needed for construction would be delayed, and the world, as we know it, would come to a standstill. This week is also important because it gives us a moment to shine a light on drivers challenges. Being a truck driver is not an easy job. Long hours, time away from family, and the mental and physical demands of operating a large vehicle take a toll. Yet, despite these hurdles, drivers push forward because they know their work is vital. For me, this week is a way to say Thank you to every driver out there. Thank you for the sacrifices you make, for putting safety first, and for being the backbone of our economy. This appreciation isn t just about celebrating a profession it s about recognizing the dedication, skill, and heart it takes to be a truck driver. Celebrating drivers with Motive In my journey from being a truck driver, broker driver, owner driver, enterprise exec, and consultant driver, I ve seen firsthand how technology can make a driver s life easier and safer. Motive has been at the forefront of this change, offering tools like AI dash cams , real-time coaching , and GPS tracking to help drivers do their jobs more efficiently and safely. These tools don t just benefit companies they directly impact the drivers by making their work environment safer, providing feedback that helps them grow, and ensuring they get the recognition they deserve while protecting them from the crazy that exists on our roads. During Truck Driver Appreciation Week, let s go beyond the traditional thanks. With Motive s technology, we can celebrate drivers not just with words but with actions. Using insights from telematics, we can create incentive programs that reward safe driving behaviors, recognize milestones, and offer tangible benefits. Using tools like Motive s system to track miles driven safely, fuel efficiency, and adherence to safety protocols, companies can offer bonuses, gift cards, or additional time off to show genuine appreciation. Building a culture of respect and support In my career, I ve learned that being a truck driver is more than getting from point A to point B. It s about being part of a community that supports one another. This week is a reminder for all of us to foster that community and build a culture of respect and support within the industry. Driver Appreciation Week is not just a corporate event. It s a personal moment for me and every other driver who has ever sat behind the wheel of a big rig. It s about recognizing the hard work, perseverance, and pride that every driver brings to their job. Let s use this week to say thank you and commit to making the road ahead safer, more rewarding, and more supportive for every driver out there. For those drivers who ve been on the road for years and those just starting their journey, this week is for you. Thank you for all that you do.\n",

            "Discover how integrating advanced technology, tailored training, and a strong company culture is key to recruiting and retaining drivers in today s trucking industry.\n",
            "This Western Star, pictured above, was the first truck I drove professionally and the first I wrecked professionally . In most cases, the advancements made in trucks over the years have made a world of difference for drivers. I say in most cases because one thing I never had an issue with was steer tires being chewed to pieces on the outer edge. Until they changed to tighter turn radiuses, that is. nbsp The trucking industry is undergoing a new shift with the integration of advanced tech aimed at enhancing safety , compliance , and operational efficiency. These tools are becoming the go-to and must-have, from GPS tracking to AI dash cams . The tech evolution has created unique challenges, especially in driver recruitment and retention, facilitating the need for a different approach to bridge the gap between experienced drivers and fresh, green trainees. In a litigious society and an industry ripe with new CDL holders, there s a devil behind every bush. Side view cameras and dual-facing dash cams , like those offered by Motive, have become the must-haves in driver monitoring and safety. We re not dealing with the same veteran drivers of the past. We re not dealing with the same motivations. The proverbial carrot- and-the-stick are now seriously different for the driver demographic shift we re facing. Driver experience and proper training have become serious concerns. Modern technology provides real-time insights into driver behavior, helping to reduce risk and improve training. No driver wants to sit through hours of Smith System or defensive driver training when the driver s needs differ vastly from those of any other driver. Driver training and coaching should be tailored exclusively to the driver s needs. Veteran drivers vs. new CDL recruits Veteran drivers with extensive experience and a strong work ethic often view driver-facing cameras as an intrusion, affecting their sense of privacy and freedom. In many cases, they look for long hours to get the job done so they can make more money and meet the customer s needs without the oversight that modern technology brings to the table. On the other hand, new recruits, often less experienced and with different motivations, see technology as a natural part of their job. In other words, they were born into it. They have never known the industry to be anything except what it is today. They expect the industry to provide tools that make their lives easier. Money is not the only motivator for the new driver persona culture matters. Bridging the gap Bridge that gap by using tailored training programs that address the needs of both veteran drivers and recruits. For veterans, focus on the benefits of technology and educate them on how the tech works. Start changing your culture. Develop and implement incentive programs to encourage the adoption of tech. For dash cams , start with front-facing and transition to dual-facing as your culture shifts and cams become more accepted. Often, it s not the camera that the driver doesn t trust it s the employer or the management the employer has in place. For the less experienced drivers and applicants, emphasize training that builds their skills and confidence. Coaching and monitoring Dash cams and other monitoring tools provide the data needed to coach and train drivers. By understanding each driver s specific issues and pain points, carriers can offer personalized feedback and training. This approach helps mold new-age recruits into drivers comparable to solid, experienced, old-school drivers by focusing on their development and improvement. Without the visibility that dash cams provide, you will always be behind the 8-ball. Without visibility, you lack awareness, and without awareness, you can t drive continuous improvement . Imagine a physician starting without practice and without a guide to mold them into a world-class practitioner. Why do we think drivers are any different? They need technology to help them develop safer, more efficient habits. Overcoming privacy resistance Veteran drivers sometimes resist the implementation of safety technology due to privacy concerns . Transparent communication about the use, purpose, and benefits of technology can help ease concerns. The primary goal is to enhance safety and efficiency, not invade privacy. Carriers have to embrace cultural change, and not just when it comes to safety technology. The market is changing, drivers are changing, regulations are changing, and perception and insurance are all changing. Being adaptable and encouraging all drivers to embrace new solutions is key at the end of the day, you must have a culture they trust. Management drives that culture. Highlight success, celebrate excellent driver behavior and scores , and provide ongoing support to ensure a smooth transition and address concerns proactively as they arise. As the industry standardizes these practices and more carriers adopt these processes and systems, a lot of this will subside. Integrating advanced technology in our industry presents challenges and opportunities. Addressing the cultural shift needed to accommodate veteran and new drivers should include leveraging dash cams, scoring, and coaching models, as well as incentives, to improve training and ensure operational efficiency. This is key to successful recruitment and retention in our industry as it stands right now.\n",

            "Welcome to the September edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report. What follows is an analysis of the major trends in the supply chain and economy across the Motive platform of 120,000 customers during the past month. Motive plays a crucial role supporting the businesses that operate in the middle of the supply chain and economy. By tracking the volume of goods moving into distribution centers and crossing borders, Motive has a clear view of the flow of inventory before it reaches stores. Our unique insights into what s happening between consumer spending and the movement of goods serve as a leading indicator of consumer demand, retail inventory changes, and other market trends before they fully materialize. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Motive Predictions Strikes at U.S. ports could create major supply chain issues for North America, including higher consumer prices and regional price spiking nbsp Recent surges in retailers inventories could mitigate potential port strikes impact and protect 2024 holiday sales nbsp Consumers will do more in-person shopping this holiday season, with brick-and-mortar seeing highest increases in sales volumes Trucks warehouse visits will continue to climb in the next two months, peaking in November as retailers prepare for holiday shopping The outcome of the 2024 presidential election will have little impact on the trucking industry in the near-term increased tariffs would impact ocean freight more than ground Top Findings Import volumes at two major U.S. ports, Port of L.A. and Laredo, are set to surpass peak pandemic levels Port of L.A., the largest seaport in the U.S. saw 60 year-over-year growth in imports in July Trade with Mexico drove a 24 rise in imports in August by commercial vehicles through one of the nation s busiest international trade ports in Laredo, Texas Macro-uncertainty, including potential strikes, has influenced retailers inventory plans, prompting a three month inventory surge across sectors Truck visits to grocery and superstore warehouses saw four-year highs Warehouse visits and strong brick-and-mortar performance show retailers anticipate strong consumer spending this holiday season Transportation and logistics leaders are assessing how election outcomes will impact the freight industry and global supply chain nbsp Trucking market sees positive growth for second month in a row as it continues positive trajectory Record-high imports indicate retailers are preparing for strong Q4 consumer demand and potential strikes at U.S. ports Data from two major U.S. ports reveal retailers anticipate strong consumer demand in Q4 and are preparing for a record holiday season . The Port of Los Angeles, the largest seaport in the U.S., saw 60 year-over-year growth in imports in July, moving toward levels last seen when consumer demand peaked during the pandemic in 2021. In addition, our data shows that imports by commercial vehicles through the land port in Laredo, Texas on the U.S. Mexico border, which is the nation s largest port by trade value, jumped 24.4 year-over-year in August. This marks the highest level of imports at the Laredo border crossing in four years and is further evidence of nearshoring s impact on U.S. trade dynamics. nbsp The surge in imports may also indicate retailers are preparing for major supply chain disruptions as potential port strikes loom. If an agreement between the International Longshoremen Association ILA and port owners is not reached by the October 1 deadline, labor halts could have major impacts across the U.S. economy. The ILA handles 43 of all U.S. imports and 3.7 billion dollars in monthly trade that moves through ports on the East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. Strikes at these ports could force businesses across retail, manufacturing, agriculture, logistics, and other major sectors to scramble as they try to mitigate huge financial and job losses. For consumers, this disruption could mean product shortages, delays in last-mile shipping, and significant pricing impacts. The concentration of their supply chains to fewer ports could cause regional price spikes, with eastern and southeastern regions facing the highest prices. Consumers could see increased prices across the board as sellers pass on skyrocketing shipping costs . Retailers robust inventories could help mitigate some of the short-term fallout from the strikes. In the last three months we have seen retailers bring in inventory earlier than previous years, driven both by strong consumer demand and macro-uncertainty around issues like these labor negotiations. The high levels of inventory restocking could help sellers meet consumer demand this holiday season as many products set to be sold in Q4 are already arriving at U.S. warehouses. Another reason retailers may be well positioned to withstand the near-term impacts of port strikes is that they are used to adopting nimble approaches in response to market volatility. Supply chain disruptions have become the norm the last four or more years, and survival has required fast re-strategizing. Our take While the port strikes could significantly disrupt the supply chain and cause higher consumer prices in 2025, we don t think strikes would significantly impact Q4 consumer spending and holiday shopping. Retailers stock up in anticipation of strong Q4 consumer demand with brick-and-mortar poised to see biggest gains The summer retailer restocking momentum continued in August, according to Motive s Big Box Retail Index, which tracks truck visits to warehouses of the top 50 U.S. retailers. Truck visits were close to July numbers with an index score of 80.1, representing a 7.7 year-over-year increase. Several sectors set record highs for warehouse visits grocery and superstore retailers rose 14 year-over-year to the highest level we ve seen for late-August in the last four years, and department store and apparel retailers jumped 27.1 year-over-year. Inventory-to-sales ratios, or the amount of stock retailers are holding in relation to their sales volume, rose to 1.29 from 1.27. We expect this to continue to climb as retailers continue restocking inventory ahead of the holiday season and potential port strikes. nbsp Brick-and-mortar heavy industries, including apparel, department stores, grocery, and superstores, saw the highest levels of restocking. These increases signal sellers anticipate heavy in-store traffic this holiday season and have high confidence in consumer spending in Q4. We predict sales in brick-and-mortar industries will continue to rise through the rest of 2024. Our take While retailers have been restocking inventories at higher levels year-over-year since March, we predict the highest surge of 2024 will begin in the last week of September and peak in November as retailers prepare for the holiday shopping, which can account for up to 30-50 of yearly sales . We anticipate stronger holiday sales this year compared to last with apparel, grocery, and superstore sectors seeing the highest holiday increases in sales volumes. Retail Index - Discount Retailers amp Wholesalers Retail Index - Grocery and Superstores Retail Index - Home Improvement Retail Index- Department Stores, Apparel amp Electronics Retail Inventories Sales Ratio General Merchandise Stores Source Fred Trucking market continues positive growth leaders assess potential 2024 election impacts In August, new carrier registrations in the trucking market rose for the second consecutive month, climbing 4.3 since July. This marks an 11.6 decrease compared to 2023 and a 37 increase since 2019. Carriers exiting the market rose marginally in August 1,153 compared to 915 in July. While this represents a 26 month-to-month increase, it marks a 52 decline year-over-year. While both metrics regressed slightly in August, the trucking market continues to move toward profitability as rates and consumer demand remain elevated. nbsp Speculation around the potential impacts of the 2024 presidential election is spurring some concern across transportation and supply chain leaders. The government s future investment in infrastructure , including expansion of passenger rail between cities, investments in bridges, and even high-speed internet, could impact the transportation industry. Clean fleet regulations and different electric vehicle legislation are also being discussed, with speculation that a Harris administration would continue with the Biden administration s policies calling for increased funding for electric charging stations and reducing greenhouse gasses. Tariffs imposed by either administration could be some of the most impactful legislation for transportation. The 10 increase on goods from China proposed by Trump would dramatically affect the importing and sale of goods, especially from Eastern Asia. If in effect, increased tariffs on Chinese goods would cause import volumes to immediately spike as retailers attempt to fast-track cargo before the tariffs are in effect. Such an import rush this fall could trigger high prices for consumers. Given Chinese imports travel primarily by ocean freight, impacts to ocean freight to be more dramatic than trucking. Both administrations are likely to consider tariff policies that have the U.S. leaning less and less on China , and we expect American businesses to continue to rely on Mexico as a key importer. Our take Regardless of which new tariff policies go into effect, we expect Mexico s powerful position in the global supply chain, as well as nearshoring, to continue to grow. We don t believe the outcome of the presidential election will significantly impact the trucking industry in the short term and we predict the market will continue its current trajectory as we move into 2025. As ACT research president Kenny Vieth recently noted , The beauty of this industry is that the U.S. economy is entirely dependent on trucks and truck transportation. And regardless of who gets elected, we re still going to be eating and drinking and buying clothes and cars and houses the day after the election. We are, as a group, in a very good industry. It s like death, taxes, and distribution. Summary This month, high import volumes at the Port of Los Angeles, up 60 year-over-year in July, and the land port in Laredo, Texas, up 24 in August, revealed retailers are preparing for a strong fourth quarter and holiday shopping cycle. The inventory surge may also be prompted by macro-level uncertainty as concerns over potential port strikes and increased tariffs grow. Four-year highs in truck visits for sectors including grocery and superstore, as well as apparel, department stores, and electronics, signal high confidence in consumer spending and brick-and-mortar sales this holiday season and we could see more in-person shopping this season than in years past. Finally, the trucking market s overall momentum continues and we expect the positive performance to continue, regardless of the outcome of the 2024 election.

            "Discover the 6 key elements of a fleet safety program that reduce accidents, improve compliance, boost efficiency, and lower liability costs.\n",
            "In fleet-based industries, where safe and efficient operations are critical to business success, establishing a reputable fleet safety program is essential. Whether you re managing delivery vans, pickup trucks, or large commercial vehicles, a well-structured safety program minimizes risks, reduces accidents, and protects drivers. This guide walks you through the top elements of an effective fleet safety program and the benefits of implementing one. Lastly, it will provide a fleet safety program template, ready for immediate implementation. Download Motive s Ultimate Guide to fleet safety What is a fleet safety program? A fleet safety program is a set of policies, procedures, and protocols designed to ensure that a company s fleet of vehicles operates safely. It focuses on reducing accidents, protecting drivers, ensuring compliance, and minimizing liability . In short, it s a comprehensive framework that addresses every aspect of fleet operations related to safety, from driver hiring and training to performance monitoring and accountability. Having a world-class fleet safety program is the right thing to do for your employees and other motorists on the roadway. It improves your bottom line by reducing accident costs, downtime, medical expenses, and liability. Running a top-tier safety program also helps you stay compliant and have a respected brand. Jim Higby, Lead, Safety and Compliance Strategy, at Motive For businesses that rely on vehicles to operate, a robust safety program is essential to maintaining operational efficiency and protecting both human and material assets. These programs are particularly important in industries such as logistics, transportation, construction , and commercial delivery services , where vehicle accidents can have serious consequences. 6 key elements of a great fleet safety program A great fleet safety program incorporates several critical elements. Below are the primary components any business should focus on when designing or improving their program. 1. Quality hiring and onboarding The foundation of any successful fleet driver safety program starts with hiring the right drivers. A comprehensive hiring process ensures that only qualified, experienced, and safe drivers are brought into the organization. This reduces the risk of accidents and creates a safety-conscious workforce from day one. Be aware, there are regulations and standards within the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association FMCSA that require background checks, motor vehicle records and thorough safety standards. Best practices for driver hiring Background checks Conduct thorough background checks, including driving history, criminal records, and verification of commercial driver s licenses CDLs . Driving record evaluation Make sure drivers have a clean or minimally impacted driving record, focusing on past accidents, traffic violations, and risky behaviors. Skill assessments Assess each driver s competency behind the wheel through practical driving tests, particularly if specialized vehicle operation is required. Onboarding process Once a driver is hired, an effective onboarding process should be in place to instill company values and safety expectations. During onboarding Introduce drivers to the company s fleet safety policy and clearly define the expectations around safe driving practices. Offer hands-on training with fleet-specific vehicles and technologies. Use a fleet safety program template like Motive s to ensure consistency and thoroughness in onboarding. 2. Leveraging safety technology The integration of safety technology is one of the most impactful ways to reduce risks and enhance driver safety. Modern advancements in telematics, driver monitoring systems, and vehicle safety features provide fleet managers with critical data and real-time insight. Key safety technologies Telematics systems These systems monitor vehicle usage and driver behaviors such as speed, harsh braking, rapid acceleration, and idling time. This data is invaluable for identifying high-risk behaviors and addressing them through coaching and corrective action. Driver assistance systems Advanced driver-assist systems ADAS such as automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and blind-spot monitoring reduce the risk of accidents by assisting drivers in maintaining safe control of the vehicle. AI dash cams AI dash cams can record both the road and the driver, allowing managers to review incidents, exonerate drivers in cases of disputes, and ensure compliance with safety protocols. AI-powered dash cams are different from regular dash cams in that they detect unsafe driving behaviors in real time and with precision. An AI-powered dash cam detects unsafe driving behaviors faster and more reliably than other options, Higby says. AI dash cams like the one from Motive alert to unsafe driving behaviors as they happen, so drivers can immediately stop the behavior before it causes a crash. Automated coaching like this helps build professionalism in your fleet, instill confidence in your program, and minimize the labor required to manage it. nbsp Most importantly, Higby says, AI enables you to prevent unsafe behaviors proactively, like no other element of a safety program ever has. GPS tracking GPS ensures route optimization and helps monitor vehicle locations, providing additional safety controls in terms of monitoring driving behaviors and ensuring timely responses to emergencies. 3. Accountability and continuous driver coaching Accountability is essential to the success of any fleet safety training program. Without clear systems for tracking performance and providing feedback, even the most well-designed program can fall short. Continuous coaching reinforces safe driving practices and offers opportunities for improvement. In most professions, there s a lot of value placed on continuous learning and updating your knowledge, and the same applies to drivers, Higby says. Dash cam-based coaching, where drivers can see video clips of their own driving habits, is a valuable tool that helps drivers learn, grow, and drive more defensively. nbsp Steps for effective driver coaching Regular performance reviews Fleet managers should regularly review telematics data and other performance metrics to identify high-risk behaviors such as speeding, tailgating, or driving while distracted. One-on-one coaching Schedule face-to-face or virtual meetings to address specific areas of improvement. Use data to explain where the driver can improve and highlight any positive behaviors. Training refreshers Continuous education is key. Whether it s defensive driving techniques or updates on new technologies, ongoing training helps reinforce safe driving practices and ensures drivers remain compliant with all safety standards. Accountability can also be formalized through written policies, progressive discipline, and termination procedures for drivers who consistently fail to meet safety expectations. 4. Performance tracking and visibility Visibility is key to maintaining and improving fleet safety, Higby says. Without real-time tracking and data analysis , it s impossible to measure the effectiveness of your fleet safety program. Performance tracking and video-based technologies reveal the risks unfolding in your program, and at the most critical times. They re essential to protecting your drivers and your business. Critical metrics to track Accidents and near-misses Keep a detailed record of all incidents and near-misses to identify patterns and areas for improvement. Driver behavior data Use telematics to track risky behaviors such as speeding, harsh braking, distracted driving, or failure to adhere to rest breaks. Vehicle condition reports Monitor vehicle health, including regular maintenance, inspections, and reports on repairs. Having access to real-time data provides fleet managers with insights that can be immediately acted upon, whether it s offering targeted coaching or scheduling necessary maintenance to prevent accidents. 5. Implementing a fleet safety incentive program An effective fleet safety incentive program encourages safe driving techniques and builds a sense of ownership and motivation among drivers. Incentives can take various forms and should be linked to measurable safety-related outcomes. Examples of fleet safety incentives Financial rewards Offer bonuses, gift cards, or even salary increases to drivers with excellent safety records. These could be awarded monthly, quarterly, or annually. Public recognition Recognize safe drivers at team meetings or company events. Trophies, plaques, or certificates of achievement can be powerful motivators. Additional benefits Provide incentives such as extra paid time off, access to better vehicle models, or even career advancement opportunities for drivers who consistently meet or exceed safety benchmarks. 6. Building a strong safety culture A great commercial fleet safety program is only as effective as the culture that supports it. It s important to foster a safety-first mindset across the entire organization, starting from leadership down to every driver. How to build a safety culture Leadership buy-in Safety policies and procedures must be supported at the highest levels of management. Executives and managers should consistently communicate the importance of safety and lead by example. Ongoing communication Regular meetings, newsletters, or bulletins about safety tips, incidents, and policy updates keep safety top of mind for all employees. Driver empowerment Encourage drivers to report unsafe conditions, suggest safety improvements, or share lessons learned from near-misses. A strong safety culture ensures that everyone is working together to minimize risks and improve overall safety performance. The benefits of a comprehensive fleet safety program Implementing and maintaining a comprehensive fleet safety program provides a range of benefits to the business, drivers, and the broader community. Here s why investing in a strong safety framework is crucial 1. Reduced accidents and lower liability The primary benefit is fewer accidents, which translates to fewer vehicle repairs, reduced insurance costs, and less potential for litigation. A well-run fleet driver safety program ensures drivers are educated and equipped to avoid risky behaviors, thereby reducing collisions and their associated costs. 2. Lower insurance premiums Insurers are more likely to offer reduced premiums for fleets that demonstrate a commitment to safety. A commercial fleet safety program with verifiable safety records, advanced safety technologies, and driver training programs can significantly lower overall insurance costs . 3. Enhanced operational efficiency By reducing accidents, you minimize vehicle downtime. Drivers who adhere to safety protocols also drive more efficiently, leading to lower fuel costs, better vehicle maintenance, and improved route optimization. 4. Compliance with OSHA and DOT Standards Maintaining compliance with OSHA and DOT regulations ensures your fleet avoids costly fines and legal issues. A well-structured fleet safety program policy will help your company stay compliant, providing peace of mind that your fleet is operating within legal guidelines. 5. Higher driver retention and satisfaction Drivers who feel safe and supported tend to stay with the company longer. Implementing a fleet safety incentive program encourages driver loyalty, reduces turnover, and boosts morale. A robust fleet safety incentive program encourages better compliance and deeper engagement in the safety culture. 6. Better revenue opportunities Operating a world-class fleet safety operation improves revenue and the quality of revenue, meaning that it pays well for the job done, Higby says. For example, because you re a safe fleet, you ll be entrusted to deliver packages for reputable businesses that can pay more. If your business has a horrible safety record, customers might say We don t trust you and give the business to someone else. Or you ll end up transporting goods for a business that pays much less.

            "Learn how vehicle blind spots pose serious risks for drivers, especially those operating large vehicles, and how Motive can help reduce these dangers.\n",
            "Blind spots are a well-known hazard, but they can be especially dangerous for drivers of large vehicles and those sharing the road with them. Hidden areas where visibility is obstructed can lead to serious collisions if drivers aren t vigilant. Advancements in vehicle technology, including Motive s AI Omnicam , can reduce these risks. Vehicle-created blind spots Blind spots are areas around a vehicle that the driver cannot see, even with the help of mirrors. In passenger vehicles, blind spots typically occur to the side and rear of the vehicle. For larger vehicles, like trucks and buses, blind spots are more extensive. They can include areas behind or in front of the vehicle, or to the sides.. The larger the vehicle, the bigger the blind spots. For instance, a commercial motor vehicle has significant blind spots known as no-zones, which can hide entire vehicles from the driver s view. These no-zones include The area extending several car lengths behind the truck. A substantial blind spot in front of large trucks, often due to the vehicle s height and the driver s position. Blind spots like these are especially prevalent on long-nosed hoods, making it difficult for drivers to see the smaller vehicles in front of them. The truck s sides, especially on the right side. Natural human blind spots In addition to vehicle-created blind spots, drivers must be aware of natural human blind spots, known as scotomas . These are areas where the eye s optic nerve passes through the retina, creating a small area in our vision where no image is detected. Although our brains typically compensate for this by filling in the missing information, it s still a potential risk factor, especially when combined with other blind spots. The importance of vigilance and mirror checks To mitigate blind spot dangers, drivers should remain vigilant and check their mirrors regularly. This practice is particularly critical when merging or changing lanes. By following the best practices below, drivers can ensure their surroundings are clear. Before any lane change or merge, check all mirrors thoroughly to ensure vehicles aren t in your blind spots. Keep monitoring mirrors during the entire lane change or merge, not just before it starts. This helps ensure that a vehicle won t suddenly appear in your blind spot in the middle of your maneuver. Continuously scan the road to know which vehicles are around you. If a once-visible vehicle is no longer in sight, assume it could be in your blind spot and take extra precautions. 360 cameras help prevent blind spot-related collisions Motive s AI Omnicam is a powerful tool in combating the risks associated with blind spots and can give additional insights when the vehicle makes an unsafe lane change, as the side cameras footage is also automatically available for coaching on that Unsafe Lane Change event. Safer driving with blind spot detection Many modern vehicles are now equipped with advanced technologies, such as blind spot monitoring systems, lane departure warnings, and rearview cameras. These systems provide audible or visual alerts when another vehicle enters a blind spot, helping drivers avoid potential collisions. Blind spot monitoring uses sensors to detect vehicles in adjacent lanes that may not be visible in the mirrors. It alerts the driver with a light or sound, indicating it s unsafe to change lanes. A lane departure warning warns drivers when they unintentionally drift out of their lane, often due to failing to check a blind spot before changing lanes. Blind spots, whether created by vehicles or natural human scotomas, are a risk factor for all drivers, particularly those operating large vehicles. These risks can be greatly reduced through AI dash cams , 360-degree cameras, and vigilant driving practices. Regular mirror checks, continuous awareness of your surroundings, and modern vehicle safety features contribute to safer driving and fewer accidents on the road. By integrating these practices and technologies, fleets can enhance safety and protect drivers from blind spots. Don t let blind spots put your team at risk Equip your vehicles with the Motive AI Omnicam to ensure full visibility and safer driving.\n",

            "Stay ahead of the East and Gulf Coast 2024 port strike. Discover how proactive supply chain strategies can minimize disruptions and keep your business thriving.\n",
            "Approximately 45,000 dock workers at U.S. ports along the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico went on strike just after midnight on October 1st, 2024, disrupting the flow of goods in and out of the country. It s the first strike by the International Longshoremen s Association since 1977 and could significantly impact the global supply, potentially leading to shortages of goods like household essentials and electronics, automotive parts, agricultural goods, and even baby formula. What s happening? The strike will primarily affect goods from Europe, India, and other countries that rely on direct shipping routes across the Atlantic Ocean. East Coast and Gulf Coast ports handle between 43 to 49 of the total containerized goods entering the United States, making them a critical hub for imports. Here s a look at the ports being impacted by the strike. Source OpenStreetMap Contributors While the effects won t be as dramatic as what we saw during the COVID lockdowns, we can still expect disruptions in key sectors like retail, automotive, manufacturing , and, to some extent, agriculture , which faces unique challenges due to the perishability of its products. What s at stake? The strike s economic impact largely depends on how long the work stoppage lasts. The longer the strike goes on, the more severe the disruptions. Goods waiting offshore could be rerouted, delayed, or, in some cases, even canceled. When ships are forced to sit idle or reroute, it adds costs for carriers, who typically pass those costs on to consumers and businesses through surcharges. For every day of the strike, it takes four to six days to clear the backlog. If the stoppage stretches to a week or longer, it could take weeks if not months for supply chains to return to normal. The contingency plan To mitigate the damage, some companies have already rerouted their goods to West Coast ports or opted to send freight by air. However, these options aren t available for every product, and they come with higher costs. Flexibility is crucial, but the strain on the supply chain will be significant, especially given that schedules for cargo ships are set weeks or months in advance. This situation echoes the challenges we saw during the pandemic, and companies are scrambling to adapt their supply chains. Some are turning to near-shoring, moving manufacturing closer to their customers to reduce the dependency on long-haul shipping. But this isn t a solution that can be implemented overnight. It requires time, resources, and infrastructure, which means many companies remain vulnerable. Why timing matters This strike couldn t have come at a worse time right at the start of peak consumer demand season. Retailers are ramping up inventories in preparation for the holiday shopping season, and many shippers have increased their volume at the impacted ports to get ahead of the work stoppage. Despite these efforts, not all sectors have been able to avoid delays. Ripple effects on transportation As the strike lingers, ripple effects will be felt across the entire transportation system. Increased demand for trucking and rail services will strain capacity and likely lead to further delays. Although these forms of transportation are more nimble than ocean freight, repositioning equipment and adding capacity takes time and comes with additional costs. In the end, the lack of cargo fluidity will likely result in higher prices for goods. It s estimated that each day ports remain closed, it costs the U.S. economy 4.5 billion . The longer the strike continues, the greater the likelihood of product shortages, price hikes, and even layoffs in sectors dependent on raw materials. What can businesses do? To weather this storm, companies in the supply chain, especially trucking and rail companies, should have active conversations with their partners to understand how the strike could impact their business. Having robust contingency plans in place is essential. It s not just about keeping operations running it s about keeping customers informed and reassured during times of uncertainty.

It s vital to compare apples to apples when benchmarking to ensure accurate results. The 10 steps to assessing the maturity of your safety program Assessing your safety readiness isn t a one-time effort. It s an ongoing process that should be integrated into your regular operations. Here are 10 important steps to help you get started Identifying gaps and setting realistic goals Once you ve assessed the current state of your safety program, it s time to address program gaps. By reviewing safety data, conducting driver surveys, and tracking near-miss reports, you ll be able to identify vulnerabilities that could lead to accidents, lawsuits, or damage to vehicles and equipment. Setting realistic, measurable goals for improvement is the key to enhancing safety performance across your franchise. Franchises that actively identify and address weaknesses are more likely to prevent costly incidents and maintain brand integrity. Positive reinforcement and knowledge sharing across franchisees can make a significant difference in improving safety behaviors. Remember, penalizing drivers alone won t create lasting change encouragement and proactive coaching will. Creating a safety metric and safety scores A well-defined safety metric is essential for tracking safety performance across your franchise network. Without it, you re operating in the dark, unable to measure how well your franchisees are performing and where improvements need to be made. At the franchisee level, comparing safety scores from one driver to the next reveals which employees are performing safely and which need coaching. These scores provide a clear reflection of a franchisee s commitment to safety, showing they care enough to measure performance. Why safety scores matter Safety scores are the foundation for building a data-driven approach to safety management across your franchise. They allow you to quantify performance, track improvements over time, and make informed decisions that directly impact the safety and success of your business. Use them to Monitor trends across the franchise at a glance Safety scores like the Motive Safety Score give managers a comprehensive view of driver performance over time.

            "Some vendors operate like well-oiled sales machines. Their primary goal is to close the deal as quickly as possible, with little regard for your long-term success. These companies often have polished sales pitches, aggressive tactics, and impressive market shares. However, once the contract is signed, their focus shifts away from your needs. On the other hand, a customer-focused partner is invested in your success from the first interaction and remains dedicated to supporting you long after the sale. They are confident in the value of their product and encourage you to take your time, trial their system , and compare it with others in the market. Their goal is not just to make a sale, but to ensure that you are satisfied and successful in your operations. The risk of choosing a sales machine Imagine you re facing a critical issue with your telematics system , such as data reporting problems that hinder your ability to manage your fleet effectively. When you reach out to your vendor, a sales-driven company might offer a dismissive response like, Sorry, that s just how it is. Those are the reports we have. Worse still, you may be left waiting weeks or months for a resolution, as their support is more about putting out fires than proactively solving your problems. Some fleets have reported waiting as long as 90 days to solve critical equipment issues. Even if a response comes, a response doesn t guarantee a solution. When faced with reporting issues or equipment malfunctions, some vendors respond by pushing additional software purchases, such as Tableau, for you to create your own reports, rather than providing a built-in solution. An approach like this adds unnecessary complexity and cost, emphasizing a lack of commitment. Contrast this with a company like Motive, which prioritizes customer service and offers immediate, effective support. If you need a custom report, Motive s professional services team works with you to create it, ensuring you have the tools you need to operate smoothly. Motive s focus is on getting you back on the road and minimizing downtime rather than closing the next sale. The value of a true partnership A true partner understands that your success is their success. They invest in a long-term relationship, offering ongoing support and adapting their services to meet your evolving needs. Motive, for example, provides comprehensive telematics solutions and a suite of products designed to make your operations more efficient from fuel management and GPS tracking to advanced AI-powered event detection. When you trial different vendors, note how they respond to your concerns. Are they pushing you to sign quickly, or do they encourage you to take your time and make an informed decision? A sales machine will likely prioritize closing the deal over addressing your specific needs, while a partner will work with you to ensure that their product genuinely benefits your operations at a very practical level. Lessons learned from a bad vendor experience In the trucking industry, choosing the wrong vendor can have serious consequences. One motor carrier reported that after signing with a technology provider, they encountered significant issues with vehicles being locked in park due to the system s inability to communicate properly with the vehicle s ECM. Engineers reportedly bypassed safety management and suggested to the fleet team that bypassing the ECM an illegal action under ELD mandates would keep the unit powered. This advice put the carrier at risk of non-compliance with FMCSA regulations. Nonetheless, it emphasized the provider s focus on retaining the contract rather than ensuring compliance and safety. In contrast, Motive provided a legal and effective solution to the issue of Interlock ECM without pushing for an immediate switch. They suggested a simple 200 wiring harness to solve the matter, demonstrating a commitment to compliance and customer success. Ultimately, the carrier switched entirely to Motive, avoiding the risk and frustration found with other vendors. Making the right choice When selecting a vendor for your fleet s needs, don t just buy into the hype of aggressive sales tactics or flashy market shares. Instead, focus on finding a genuinely invested partner in your success. Trial different products and services, consult with others in the industry, and take your time to make an informed decision. Your vendor should make your operations easier and more efficient, not add layers of complexity and risk. A sales machine is focused on its bottom line, while a customer-focused partner is dedicated to helping you succeed. Choose wisely, and avoid the regret of picking the wrong vendor.

            "Discover how the recent 462 million verdict against Wabash National is challenging federal safety standards and raising concerns over nuclear verdicts.\n",
            "For decades, the trucking industry and federal regulators have worked together to balance public safety with business growth. Recently, however, massive nuclear verdicts have shifted that balance, rewarding some attorneys while placing heavy burdens on companies. One recent example is a St. Louis jury s decision on September 5, awarding a staggering 462 million in a case against Wabash National. Of that, 450 million accounted for punitive damages, tied to claims that Wabash should have designed a stronger rear impact guard more than 20 years ago. Plaintiffs argument A message to commercial fleets Plaintiffs attorneys argue that only large jury verdicts can send a strong message to commercial fleets, pushing them to prevent future accidents. In this case, Wabash, a leading trailer manufacturer, was accused of failing to exceed government standards for rear underride bumpers. This verdict is yet another sign that plaintiffs are using aggressive legal tactics like the reptile theory to target not just trucking companies, but manufacturers of the equipment they use. The 2019 crash Tragedy on the highway The case stemmed from a tragic 2019 crash in which an intoxicated driver in a Volkswagen slammed into the back of a Wabash trailer. The truck had slowed due to construction, and the Volkswagen went under the trailer, killing both the driver and the passenger, neither of whom were wearing seatbelts. The jury found that Wabash could have designed a stronger underride guard, exceeding federal requirements, but chose not to. Wabash countered that their trailer met and even surpassed the standards of its time, and that no underride guard no matter how strong would have saved the two men given the speed of the crash. The trailer involved was built in 2005 and complied with federal standards set in 1999, which required underride bumpers to withstand impacts up to 30 mph. The plaintiffs attorneys argued that these standards were inadequate, claiming that the new standards, finalized in 2022 and requiring protection up to 35 mph, still fall short. They contended that Wabash should have equipped its trailers with bumpers capable of withstanding impacts between 45 and 55 mph. The Reptile Theory legal strategy In court, the plaintiffs used the reptile theory legal approach, accusing Wabash of participating in an unlawful conspiracy to knowingly produce dangerous products when better safety technology existed. They alleged this conspiracy dated back to the 1960s, long before Wabash was founded in 1985. Attorney John Simon argued that Wabash showed reckless disregard for human life by not installing stronger underride bumpers, as reported by David Siege l from the Courtroom View Network. To many, this case illustrates how companies can be held liable for accidents even when they ve adhered to federal standards. These regulations, developed through a rigorous process that includes public feedback, should protect businesses from such lawsuits. But in practice, plaintiffs can bypass these standards by convincing juries that the government regulations aren t enough, and that companies knowingly fell short. When the federal government creates rules, it s bound by the Administrative Procedures Act APA . According to the U.S. General Services Administration , the APA ensures public transparency in the rulemaking process, while holding government accountable to address public input. This transparency and accountability ensures integrity throughout the process. In my experience, the process often takes years. In fact, the latest rear underride rule took seven years to finalize. The challenge of inconsistent verdicts What s frustrating to many is that even after seven years of wrangling, there s still no standard on which we can rely. That s because plaintiffs are alloed to circumvent this process and take the mater to a friendly jury of citizens who may have no relevant expertise. There, they ll argue that government standards aren t enough and that the defendant knew it, failing to take precautions. This process can repeat itself state-by-state, county-by-county, jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction. Each could return a different decision, and none will provide us with a standard that American businesses can rely on. Over the last 246 years, we ve pragmatically built a government with multiple checks and balances. One that listens to its citizens when crafting rules and provides opportunities for appeal and objection. That s part of the reason many people complain that our government works too slowly. nbsp If we don t like the decisions it makes, we always have the opportunity to petition it for change thanks to the APA . It s a beautiful process, however slow. Unfortunately, Wabash is the latest example of an attempt to short-circuit that process and ask a few people to hold a company accountable for following a well established standard. Where we go from here will require thoughtful discussion and careful consideration of how we balance safety, fairness, and the rule of law.

            "Prepare your drivers for wildlife collisions with key defensive strategies. Learn how to avoid animal strikes and keep your fleet safe this season. Ensure your drivers are prepared for wildlife collisions. Discover key strategies to avoid animal strikes and keep your fleet safe.\n",
            "We re moving into the fall season, and drivers across North America face an increased risk of animal strikes, particularly deer. While animal strikes can occur anytime, fall and early winter are peak seasons for deer-related crashes due to mating and migration. However, deer aren t the only wildlife hazards on the road. Wild boar, bears, elk, alligators, large birds, and other animals can threaten your fleet and drivers as well. Understanding how to prepare for and respond to animal strikes is an important part of being a commercial driver. In this blog post, we ll explore the impact of animal strikes, how to avoid them, and what to do if a collision is inevitable. Animal strike statistics Animal strikes are a common concern for all drivers, including those who operate commercial vehicles. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , from 1975 to the mid-2000s, there was a general upward trend in deaths from collisions with animals. However, this trend has leveled off in the past few years. There were 164 deaths from collisions with animals in 2021, most often during October-December. According to data from State Farm , U.S. drivers had an estimated 1.8 million animal collision insurance claims between July 2022 and June 2023. With more forested areas, Canada motorists are just as susceptible to animal strikes. An average of six large animal-vehicle collisions occur every hour in Canada, according to the Canadian Automobile Association CAA . While comprehensive data is limited in some countries, overarching reports indicate that animal strikes, including those involving livestock and wild animals, pose a risk, particularly in rural areas. Defensive driving strategy Avoiding animal strikes on the road requires a combination of defensive driving tactics and staying alert to your surroundings, especially when animals are most active or conditions make them harder to see. Here are some tips to keep you safe Many animals are most active during dawn and dusk. Deer, in particular, are more likely to cross roads during these times, so increased vigilance is key. Stay alert, especially at dawn and dusk. When driving at night, using high beams can help illuminate the eyes of animals, making them more visible. However, be sure to dim your lights when oncoming traffic approaches to avoid blinding other drivers. Animal crossing signs are not random. They are placed in areas with a history of animal crossings. Slow down and stay vigilant when you see them. Swerving to avoid an animal can lead to a more severe crash, especially if it results in losing control of your vehicle or veering into oncoming traffic. It is generally safer to brake firmly and remain in your lane. Knowledge of local wildlife can aid in preparedness. For instance, in Florida and Louisiana, alligators may cross the road in swampy areas, while elk and bears are more common in the Rockies and wild boars in southern Arizona. Moose may be an issue in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. Adjusting driving habits and routes based on the presence of wildlife can help mitigate risks. What to do when a crash is inevitable While common sense dictates that a driver should avoid collisions at all costs, sometimes a strike is inevitable. nbsp Maintaining control of the vehicle is paramount. When large animals like elk, moose, or wild boar are present, attempting to maneuver around them might result in more severe crashes. The best action is to brake firmly, remain in your lane, and brace for impact. Post-strike protocol If equipped with an AI-powered dash cam like the Motive AI Dashcam , management will likely be notified immediately following a collision. Here are some steps drivers should take to prioritize their safety and the safety of other road users. nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp If possible, move the vehicle to a safe location off the road to avoid secondary collisions. Turn on hazard lights to alert other drivers. Assess yourself and any passengers for injuries. If anyone is hurt, call emergency services immediately. Motive s First Responder feature can help expedite emergency response for your driver if they are incapacitated. nbsp nbsp Even if there are no injuries, reporting the incident to local authorities is essential, particularly if the animal carcass obstructs the roadway or poses a hazard to other vehicles. Before continuing on your trip, thoroughly inspect your vehicle. Check for leaks, tire damage, and other signs that your vehicle may be unsafe to drive. If your vehicle is disabled due to the collision, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA regulations dictate you must use reflective triangles or flares to warn other drivers. Place these warning devices at appropriate distances as specified by FMCSA regulations one at 10 feet, another at 100 feet, and the third at 200 feet from the vehicle, all pointing toward approaching traffic. Preparing drivers for strikes For fleets, preparing drivers for the possibility of animal strikes should be a fundamental part of driver training programs. Here are key points that highlight the importance of incorporating animal strike preparedness into your program Drivers should receive regular training on defensive driving, including how to handle unexpected wildlife. Training should cover what to do immediately following an animal strike, emphasizing safety and compliance with regulations and company policy. Drivers should be educated on the types of wildlife they might encounter in different regions and how to adjust their driving accordingly. Well-maintained vehicles can prevent secondary issues following a strike. Drivers should know how to perform vehicle inspections if a collision occurs. Animal strikes are often an unavoidable risk for drivers, but being proactive mitigates the dangers. Drivers can protect themselves, their cargo, and other road users by understanding wildlife patterns, staying alert, adhering to defensive driving practices, and knowing what to do when a strike occurs. Fleets play a big role in this, ensuring their drivers are well trained, prepared, and equipped to handle these encounters safely. Stay ahead of animal strikes this season Animal strikes are a serious risk for commercial drivers, but with the right preparation and training, you can protect your fleet and your drivers. Don t let the dangers of wildlife collisions catch your drivers off guard. With Motive AI Dashcams and real-time alerts, you can help your drivers stay aware, make safer decisions, and respond more effectively to potential wildlife hazards. Req u est a demo today.\n",

The Motive Holiday Outlook Report offers valuable data-driven predictions to guide physical economy leaders through the complexities of the holiday season and prepare them for what lies ahead. This comprehensive report focuses on the State of Safety, Retail, Freight, and Theft and Fraud , giving business leaders the insight they need to make the best decisions at a most critical time. Keep reading for the report s key highlights. Dive into the full report here. The State of Safety Managing holiday road risk The holiday season is synonymous with joy, celebration, and family gatherings. However, it also brings significant challenges, especially for fleet-based businesses. This time of year, drivers face tighter delivery deadlines, increased traffic congestion, and deteriorating weather conditions, increasing the risk of accidents. Key Insight Collision risks spike before Christmas According to Motive s 2023 Holiday Outlook Report , there s a 10 increase in speeding events leading up to Christmas, culminating in a 32 spike in crashes on Christmas Day compared to the rest of December. Hazardous weather is a major factor, with 65.5 of Christmas Day crashes occurring on wet, snowy, or icy roads. Additionally, 47 of collisions occur after dark, despite more vehicles being on the road during daylight hours. Holiday season pressures lead to a spike in hours-of-service violations as drivers push themselves to meet high demand under tight deadlines. The State of Retail Adapting to constant disruption The retail landscape has been significantly impacted by supply chain disruption over the past few years, and 2024 is no different. Retailers are under immense pressure to meet holiday demand while navigating long-term bottlenecks and unpredictable weather conditions. Key insight Early restocking drives stability In response to these challenges, retailers have shifted away from the traditional just-in-time restocking model. Instead, they ve prioritized building inventory earlier in the year. For example, Chinese imports surged by 19.7 year-over-year by mid-summer, showing that businesses are willing to invest more to meet consumer demand and avoid stockouts. Mexico has emerged as another critical player in the global supply chain. Mexican imports through the Port of Laredo increased by 30 year-over-year . By sourcing from both China and Mexico, retailers can better manage lead times and mitigate the risks associated with supply chain disruption. The State of Freight Slow recovery with signs of optimism The trucking industry has faced a turbulent year, but there are signs of cautious optimism heading into 2025. Freight rates have stagnated, and many small carriers have exited the market due to low profitability, but the market is expected to recover gradually. Key insight Moderate growth expected by 2025 While 1,300 operators exited the market in September for the third straight month, long-term growth trends are expected to return by the end of 2025, with a 5.7 year-over-year increase projected. The oversupply of carriers from the pandemic era is slowly correcting itself, which should help stabilize freight prices. The State of Theft and Fraud Escalating risks during the holidays As businesses gear up for the holiday season, they should be prepared for a rise in theft and fraud. The Motive Holiday Outlook Report highlights significant spikes in cargo theft and credit card fraud during this period. Key insight Cargo theft surges by 49 Cargo theft surged by 49 in the first half of 2024, and the holiday season is expected to worsen this trend. Many incidents occur at unsecured facilities or when trucks are left unattended during delivery. The average loss per cargo theft incident is 121,473 , a significant financial burden for businesses. Companies are increasingly using real-time tracking technology and AI-powered security systems to combat this trend. Tools like these provide instant alerts that allow businesses to track vehicles and goods in real time and recover stolen items quickly.

            "This guide to change management helps organizations navigate transitions smoothly. Learn how to reduce downtime, improve buy-in, set up your org for success.\n",
            "Change is an inevitable part of business, especially when adopting new technologies like telematics and fleet management systems. Implementing such changes successfully requires a thoughtful change management process that ensures both organizational and cultural alignment. Below is a guide to help you navigate change management effectively within your organization, ensuring a smooth transition and maximizing the benefits of the new systems. What is Change Management? Change management is a structured approach that helps businesses transition from their current state to a desired future state. According to Harvard Business School, it involves guiding changes in key aspects like company culture, technology infrastructure, and internal processes. Successful change management includes three major phases Preparation Raising awareness of the need for change. Implementation Rolling out the change while maintaining team engagement. Follow-through Embedding the change into the organization s culture and preventing a return to old ways. Why is Change Management Important? For any business to grow and adapt to evolving market conditions, change is essential. Without proper management, organizational changes such as transitioning to a new telematics platform can lead to unpredictability, low morale, and increased costs. Effective change management Ensures smoother transitions. Increases employee buy-in and commitment. Reduces downtime and productivity losses. Enhances stakeholder confidence, making your organization more attractive to investors, customers, and talent. Change management is crucial not only for executing change but also for mitigating risks during the transition. It helps avoid delays, setbacks, and resource drain, leading to a more efficient and positive outcome. Types of Change Management Transformational vs. Adaptive Transformational Change Large-scale shifts that affect the company s strategy, mission, structure, and processes. An example is implementing or replacing a telematics system, which may require significant adjustments across different departments, from driver operations to fleet management . Adaptive Change Smaller, incremental changes that allow organizations to evolve over time. These changes are less disruptive but still necessary to stay competitive and efficient. When deploying new technologies, like telematics systems, it s important to consider both transformational and adaptive changes. For instance, a new telematics platform may require a transformational approach, while routine updates to that system could be handled with an adaptive change management approach. Change Management Models Choosing the Right Approach There are various change management models, each offering a different framework for navigating change. Here are some of the most widely used models Kotter s Change Model Focuses on driving new behaviors and establishing a sense of urgency. Prosci ADKAR Model A step-by-step model emphasizing awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and reinforcement. Lewin s Change Model Advocates for a three-step approach unfreeze, change, and refreeze. McKinsey 7-S Model Provides a holistic framework addressing multiple organizational factors such as strategy, structure, and systems. Nudge Theory Focuses on gradual behavioral change through positive reinforcement. Selecting the right model depends on the nature of the change, the size of your organization, and the complexity of the initiative. Key Steps in a Change Management Process 1. Prepare the Organization Raise Awareness Employees need to understand why the change is necessary. Start by identifying the problems or challenges driving the need for change. Cultural Alignment Ensure employees are culturally prepared to embrace the change by addressing potential concerns, such as job security or additional responsibilities. 2. Craft a Strategic Plan Outline Steps Develop a clear and strategic plan that covers all aspects of the change. Consider logistics, resources, and stakeholder engagement. Assign Roles Identify key stakeholders and team members responsible for overseeing different parts of the transition. 3. Implement the Changes Follow the Plan Execute the plan while maintaining consistent communication. Highlight small wins to keep teams motivated. Address Roadblocks Be prepared to tackle obstacles as they arise, whether they are technical issues or resistance from employees. 4. Embed the Changes in the Company Culture Prevent Reversion Ensure the changes are not just temporary by embedding them in day-to-day processes. Encourage employees to adopt new habits that align with the change. Ongoing Reinforcement Keep the change top of mind by continuing education and reinforcing the benefits. 5. Review and Analyze Progress Conduct Post-Mortem Reviews After the change has been implemented, review its success and areas for improvement. Use this analysis to refine future change management processes. Continuous Improvement Leverage feedback from the change process to make ongoing adjustments and improvements. Communication A Critical Element Effective communication is the backbone of any successful change initiative. Use a top-down approach to ensure visibility at all levels of the company. This will not only help with clarity but also mitigate misunderstandings. All-Hands Meetings Organize sessions to explain the change and allow employees to ask questions. Address concerns like privacy or added responsibilities early on. Breakroom Videos amp Testimonials Highlighting positive outcomes through videos or employee testimonials can create excitement and buy-in. Transparency Always be clear about the intended results and the reasons behind the change to build trust and reduce resistance. Addressing Resistance to Change No matter how well planned, change will often meet some level of resistance. Here are strategies to overcome it Identify Skeptics Include those skeptical of the change in discussions to better understand their concerns. These skeptics can often provide valuable insights into potential issues. Union Considerations If your organization is unionized, involve union representatives early in the process. Their buy-in will be essential for a smooth rollout. Continuous Improvement and Feedback Even after the change has been implemented, the work isn t over. Regular reviews and communication should continue to ensure that the change becomes an integral part of the company s operations. Regular Town Halls Conduct post-implementation town halls to address any ongoing questions and concerns. Feedback Loops Create channels for employees to provide feedback on how the new systems are working and where improvements could be made.

            "Halloween brings risks for fleet drivers. Discover how Motive helps fleet managers protect drivers and pedestrians during this high-activity night.\n",
            "Halloween is a high-risk night for road safety, with increased pedestrian activity and the potential for impaired drivers. Halloween might be fun, but it comes with significant dangers, particularly for pedestrians, children, and even drivers. With increased pedestrian activity, especially children trick-or-treating and parties where alcohol may be involved, the risk of accidents spikes on Halloween night. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA , Halloween consistently ranks as one of the most dangerous nights of the year for pedestrian injuries and fatalities. In 2022 alone , 72 people died in traffic crashes on Halloween night between 6 p.m. and 5 59 a.m. the following day. Almost half 46 of these fatalities were alcohol-related, and 39 occurred in drunk-driving crashes. The 21 to 34 age group had the highest percentage of these fatalities 54 . Pedestrian safety Children are more than twice as likely to be hit and killed by a car on Halloween compared to any other day of the year. The dangers increase between 5 00 and 8 00 p.m. when trick-or-treating is in full swing and visibility drops. Costumes and excitement often make children less aware of their surroundings. They may dart across streets unexpectedly, increasing the risk of accidents. Drivers must be extra cautious, driving slowly through residential areas and staying alert for any movement on the road. Parents can also help by making sure their children s costumes are visible with reflective tape and flashlights and by accompanying young children during trick-or-treating. Drunk driving Drunk driving plays a massive role in the increased dangers of Halloween night. From 2018 to 2022, 52 of the vehicle occupant fatalities on Halloween involved drunk drivers. Even a small amount of alcohol can impair a driver s ability to focus and react. Drivers are strongly encouraged to avoid drinking or use a designated driver if they plan to attend parties. NHTSA also reports that the nighttime fatality rate on U.S. roadways is three times higher than during the daytime, with 76 of pedestrian fatalities occurring at night As a result, the combination of alcohol, reduced visibility, and high pedestrian activity makes Halloween night one of the most dangerous times to be on the road. How Motive can reduce Halloween night risks Motive helps provide increased visibility and plays a role in accident response. The newly introduced First Responder feature allows fleet managers to contact emergency services immediately following a severe crash, reducing response times and potentially saving lives. This feature provides essential data like the accident location, driver information, and vehicle identification, ensuring that first responders arrive prepared. For drivers, partygoers, and pedestrians, it s essential to prioritize safety on Halloween. Here are a few tips Drivers - Slow down in residential areas, eliminate distractions, and always be on the lookout for pedestrians, especially children. Avoid drinking and driving, and use your lights to increase visibility. Pedestrians - Use crosswalks, wear bright or reflective clothing, and stay on sidewalks whenever possible. Avoid distractions like cell phones and be cautious when crossing streets. Party Hosts - Be responsible with alcohol, offer guests alternative transportation options like rideshares, and ensure no one leaves your party impaired. Staying vigilant and aware of what s going on around you can help make Halloween safer for everyone on the road. Don t let the holiday turn into a tragedy. Stay alert, stay sober, and stay safe.\n",

Depending on the size of the operation and the distance traveled, fuel costs can account for up to 40 of total operating expenses. Fluctuations in diesel prices, coupled with vehicle type, load weight, and driving conditions, make this an unpredictable, yet unavoidable, cost. To mitigate fuel costs, many trucking companies invest in newer, more fuel-efficient vehicles, use real-time GPS software, and implement driver training programs focused on safe, efficient driving habits such as managing speed, reducing idling and creating space between vehicles. Fuel surcharge programs can also help carriers offset price spikes, passing a portion of fuel cost increases to customers. 3. Maintenance and repairs Keep vehicles moving Truck maintenance and repair are ongoing and essential components of operational costs. On average, maintenance and repair costs can constitute about 10 to 15 of total operating expenses. These include routine maintenance tasks such as oil changes, brake adjustments, tire replacements, and engine tune-ups, as well as more significant repairs following breakdowns or accidents. Predictive maintenance tools and telematics can help reduce unscheduled repairs by identifying issues before they become serious. However, even with these tools, the wear and tear associated with long-distance travel ensures that repair costs remain a constant financial concern for motor carriers. 4. Insurance costs Covering risks The trucking industry is inherently risky. Drivers often cover thousands of miles under changing weather conditions and road environments. To mitigate these risks, companies must carry comprehensive insurance coverage, which often includes general liability, cargo insurance, physical damage coverage, and workers compensation insurance. Insurance premiums can vary based on a range of factors, including the type of cargo transported, the size of the fleet, the driving records of the drivers, and the regions traveled. Premiums for trucking companies can represent anywhere from 4 to 10 of total operating costs, depending on the operation. Companies with higher accident rates, or those who haul hazardous materials, can expect significantly higher premiums. 5. Safety-related costs A critical but often overlooked factor While they re often categorized under other operational expenses, safety-related costs deserve special attention. These costs encompass investments in safety technologies, training programs, and compliance with federal and state regulations aimed at reducing accidents, improving driver well-being, and limiting risk. Investing in safety technology In recent years, the trucking industry has seen increased adoption of safety technologies designed to reduce accidents and improve operational efficiency. Tools such as AI dash cams , lane departure warning systems, automatic emergency braking, and collision avoidance technologies are becoming more common. Technologies like these can help lower accident rates. Though they may come with significant upfront costs, they often pay for themselves in the long run by reducing accident-related expenses and insurance premiums . Driver training and education Proper driver training is a crucial component of safety-related spending. Driver training involves both the initial training for new hires and continuous training provided by automated safety technology . Training programs can cover a wide range of topics, from defensive driving techniques to handling hazardous materials and adhering to Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA regulations. Training programs overall are a worthwhile investment. Well-trained drivers are less likely to cause accidents, leading to fewer repair bills, lower insurance premiums, and improved fleet performance. In addition, a strong safety culture helps improve driver retention, reducing turnover and its associated recruiting and training costs. Regulatory compliance and auditing Complying with safety regulations is a non-negotiable cost for any transportation operation. Failure to comply with FMCSA regulations can lead to hefty fines, shutdown orders, and even the revocation of operating authority. Key compliance areas include Hours of Service HOS regulations , vehicle inspections, and drug and alcohol testing for drivers. Maintaining compliance often involves costs related to administrative overhead, record-keeping systems, and third-party audits. Regular safety audits can help identify and rectify potential issues before they escalate into regulatory violations or accidents. 6. The hidden costs of crashes Crashes represent one of the most unpredictable and potentially devastating costs for transportation businesses. Beyond the cost of vehicle repairs, medical expenses, and cargo losses, accidents often result in legal fees, increased insurance premiums, and lost business due to reputational damage. According to the FMCSA, the average cost of a truck accident involving a fatality is over 3.6 million. Investing in preventive safety measures and ensuring regulatory compliance is the best way to avoid these catastrophic costs. Companies often see a return on investment through reduced accident-related expenses, lower insurance premiums, and improved driver retention. Conclusion Understanding and managing the operational costs of trucking is crucial to achieving and maintaining profitability in an industry with narrow margins. While fuel, labor, and maintenance are the most visible costs, safety-related expenses, though often overlooked, are equally critical. Investing in safety technologies, comprehensive training programs, and strict regulatory compliance not only helps reduce accidents and legal liability but also leads to long-term savings through lower insurance premiums and fewer repairs.\n",

            "The American Transportation Research Institute s ATRI s latest report reveals a snapshot of the transportation industry s biggest hurdles and economic pressures. The findings call attention to a persistent freight recession, soaring operational costs, and an ever-shifting regulatory environment. In this blog, we dive into ATRI s report to see how transportation issues are shaping the day-to-day realities of fleet managers, drivers, and the industry as a whole. Economic pressures and the freight recession For the second consecutive year, the economy tops the list of concerns in the ATRI survey, reflecting the broader challenges tied to a freight recession that began in 2022. While the overall U.S. economy saw growth, the trucking sector has lagged, with lower freight rates and decreased tonnage pushing many carriers out of business. nbsp The primary drivers of the freight recession include a slowdown in consumer demand, tepid retail sales, and flat manufacturing outputs, even as the broader economy shows resilience with lowering inflation and higher GDP. Margins are being squeezed by rising costs, including a 22 increase in operational expenses over the past two years. Get the full scoop on the State of Freight in the Motive 2024 Holiday Outlook Report. Truck parking shortages and infrastructure deficiencies One of the most persistent issues ATRI highlighted is the lack of available parking . This topic remains the second-highest concern among respondents, and for drivers, it s the top issue. Despite recent federal investments of more than 292 million in parking projects, as well as state-level and private initiatives, the lack of parking continues to hamper productivity and compromise driver safety . nbsp As drivers struggle to find parking from day to day, they re often left to park in unsafe locations. Local regulations restricting parking, especially in urban areas, compound the issue, leading to inefficiency and delays. Advocates are pushing for dedicated federal funding to improve parking infrastructure, which would help ease one of the most critical pain points for the industry . Legal and insurance challenges The impact of nuclear verdicts Lawsuit abuse has risen to the third-most critical issue in the industry, a reflection of the growing burden of excessive litigation. The term nuclear verdicts refers to massive settlements or judgments awarded by juries, with some awards exceeding 160 million, as seen in the recent case involving Daimler . nbsp The surge in legal costs is directly linked to higher insurance premiums. Premiums have jumped by 12.5 since 2023, further straining carriers finances. According to the ATRI study, crash numbers have decreased. Nonetheless, with the risks of potential litigation, insurance costs continue to rise . Battery electric vehicles High costs, uncertain returns For commercial fleets, the push toward electrification has grown in urgency, with battery-electric vehicles ranking as the sixth-highest concern in ATRI s 2024 survey. Regulatory mandates, particularly in states like California , have set ambitious timelines for transitioning to zero-emission vehicles. While the industry supports reducing its environmental impact, the financial burden associated with BEV adoption is a major obstacle. ATRI estimates that transitioning to BEVs will require more than 1 trillion in infrastructure investment and vehicle purchase costs . The concerns go beyond financial costs. Industry leaders also worry about the lack of charging infrastructure, the heavier weight of BEVs impacting roadways, and the potential safety risks in case of accidents involving electric trucks. Challenges like these highlight the need for a more gradual transition, one that takes into account the significant logistical and financial barriers . Driver-related issues Compensation, detention, and the shrinking workforce Driver compensation and shortages are constant issues for the industry. While driver wages have increased over the past several years, smaller fleets have struggled to keep up with the rising costs of operations, particularly as freight rates fall. ATRI notes that addressing driver pay is crucial, especially compensating for time spent during detention at customer facilities, which was responsible for over 11billion in lost revenue in 2023 alone . Detention time affects driver earnings and poses safety risks. Drivers who get delayed are more likely to speed to make up for lost time, increasing the risk of accidents. Addressing these issues can help improve driver satisfaction and safety outcomes . While the driver shortage has temporarily eased due to the freight recession, the long-term outlook is concerning. The trucking industry is still short tens of thousands of drivers, and as the economy picks up, the gap is expected to widen again as more seasoned drivers retire. The industry is exploring new pathways to attract a younger and more diverse workforce, including outreach to military veterans and underrepresented populations . CSA Still a point of frustration despite likely revisions FMCSA s Compliance, Safety, and Accountability CSA program re-entered the top 10 after falling off in 2023. Despite being in operation for more than a decade, the program raises concerns among motor carriers, particularly regarding the accuracy of safety scoring methods and the impact of state-level enforcement disparities on those scores. nbsp Stakeholders are pushing for further updates to improve transparency and fairness in how carrier performance is calculated, noting that inconsistencies across states can unfairly penalize certain fleets . In 2023, FMCSA proposed potential revisions to the program that would address many of the concerns however, a firm date for changes has yet to be published. Driver distraction An ongoing safety hazard Driver distraction remains a critical safety issue, ranking tenth in ATRI s survey. According to ATRI s 2024 Critical Issues Report , in 2022, across all vehicle types, more than 3,300 people died in distraction-related crashes, and many of them involved cell phone use. Industry leaders and safety advocates are calling for stricter penalties and tougher enforcement of anti-distraction laws. Reducing distraction for drivers is essential to improving road safety and lowering accident rates. Conclusion ATRI s 2024 Top Industry Issues Report paints a picture of an industry grappling with economic headwinds, regulatory pressures, and operational challenges. While the industry remains essential to the U.S. economy, the ability of carriers to adapt to these challenges will impact the future resilience of many transportation companies. From addressing the freight recession to preparing for an electrified future, fleets will have to navigate a complex landscape of issues that will shape its trajectory for years to come.

            "No matter which industry you re in, running your operations is challenging without adequate visibility. When you can t see incidents like sideswipes or rear-ends, you re left second-guessing and defending drivers against false claims. It s difficult to resolve disputes, prevent cargo theft, and ensure that workers are following safety protocols. Over the past year, Motive customers have turned to the AI Omnicam to solve these issues. As the only AI-enabled camera built for side, rear, passenger, and cargo monitoring, the AI Omnicam provides 360-degree visibility when paired with the Motive AI Dashcam . Across industries, fleets have used the AI Omnicam to improve safety, simplify operations, and cut costs. Here are five of the AI Omnicam s biggest benefits. 1. Exonerates drivers in sideswipe and rear-end collisions Sideswipes and rear collisions cause over 33 of fatal crashes and 44 of crash-related injuries . Having video evidence of these incidents is crucial, as commercial fleets are often unfairly blamed. In one case, a rig was sideswiped during a left turn. While the AI Dashcam footage alone was inconclusive, the AI Omnicam s side view clearly showed that the rig s driver stayed in their lane, exonerating them. We are big fans of the AI Omnicams, says Chris Jaffe, Senior Vice President of Technology at Agmark . We haven t had an at-fault accident since we installed the cameras last June, and three of the accidents that people tried to pin on us, they couldn t. Right away, we were able to show the video footage to law enforcement. The AI Omnicam has literally saved us hundreds of thousands of dollars in claims. 2. Reduces injuries by monitoring safety gear and procedures The construction industry sees more than 169,000 injuries and 1,000 fatalities annually. Proper safety gear protects workers from injury and keeps projects on track. When one customer mounted the AI Omnicam on their cranes to monitor job sites, they spotted a worker without a hard hat. The manager was able to use the footage as a coaching tool, helping to prevent future accidents. In Oil amp Gas , the AI Omnicam helps verify safety procedures, such as placing cones to create a safe perimeter during loading and unloading. Companies also use the AI Omnicam to make sure workers are wearing safety gear or oil is handled properly. Taking these precautions can reduce the risk of costly spills and injuries. 3. Reduces theft by monitoring unauthorized access Cargo theft surged by 49 in early 2024, making security more critical than ever. The AI Omnicam monitors unauthorized access to trailers and other non-motorized assets, like flatbeds and storage containers. In drop-and-hook operations, where trailers frequently switch trucks, the AI Omnicam remains linked to the trailer, providing continuous tracking and proof of delivery. 4.

            "Maximize fleet efficiency and ROI by overcoming underutilization challenges with real-time tracking, preventative maintenance, AI-powered insights.\n",
            "For businesses running commercial fleets whether in transportation , construction , or field services making the most of their equipment is key to staying profitable. Trailers, construction vehicles, and other vital assets need to be strategically managed to maximize their value. But optimizing equipment utilization can be a real challenge. Underutilized equipment can lead to missed opportunities, higher costs, and lower operational efficiency. So, why is it so important to monitor equipment utilization, and how can businesses overcome the common hurdles that get in the way? Let s take a closer look. Why equipment utilization matters Maximizing equipment utilization is essential for several reasons 1. Maximizing Return on Investment ROI Equipment is a big investment, and when it s not in use, it s not making money. Keeping your fleet running at full capacity ensures you re getting the most value from your assets while also reducing depreciation. 2. Improving Operational Efficiency Underutilized equipment can lead to slower operations, project delays, and overall inefficiencies. For rental companies, it can take up to a week just to retrieve equipment because of time-consuming yard searches, driving up labor costs and keeping equipment from generating revenue. By making sure equipment is always used efficiently, businesses can cut down on delays and keep projects on track. 3. Optimizing Capacity and Planning Businesses need clear visibility into their equipment availability and usage to avoid overestimating or underestimating their needs. Proper utilization makes sure companies have the right equipment at the right time, helping them avoid unnecessary rental or purchase costs. 4. Informed Purchase Decisions Tracking utilization data allows fleet operators to make smart decisions about when to invest in new equipment, lease additional assets, or sell off underperforming machinery. This leads to better financial planning and more efficient asset management. The root causes of underutilization Several factors contribute to the underutilization of equipment, including Lack of Real-Time Visibility nbsp Without real-time insight into equipment location and status, it s hard to spot underutilized assets. Traditional tracking methods often depend on manual reporting, which can be inaccurate and outdated. Unplanned Downtime Unplanned downtime from breakdowns or delayed maintenance can seriously impact equipment usage. When equipment is often out of service, it lowers overall utilization rates and disrupts operations. Ineffective Allocation and Deployment Without accurate data on where equipment is most needed, some assets might sit idle at one site while other locations face shortages. This kind of resource mismanagement reduces overall operational efficiency. The role of AI in solving utilization challenges The rise of AI artificial intelligence has created new opportunities for businesses to improve equipment utilization and overcome longtime challenges. Real-Time Tracking Devices like GPS trackers , let businesses monitor the location and use of their equipment in real time. This allows operators to quickly spot underutilized assets and move them to where they re needed most. Reliable Data on Utilization and Idling Advanced analytics offer valuable insight into equipment use patterns, downtime, and idling periods. With this data, businesses can optimize asset allocation and identify opportunities to sell off or acquire equipment as needed. Preventative Maintenance AI-powered maintenance solutions can predict when equipment needs servicing, helping to prevent expensive breakdowns and reduce downtime. This keeps assets available and running smoothly for maximum utilization. Unlocking equipment potential with Motive Motive s AI-powered platform gives businesses the tools they need to manage and optimize their equipment more efficiently. With real-time asset tracking, predictive maintenance, and data-driven insights, Motive helps businesses redeploy underutilized equipment where it s needed most. In turn, fleets are able to boost operational efficiency and improve their return on investment. By embracing this technology, companies can make smarter decisions, increase productivity, and enhance profitability. In short, maximizing equipment utilization is crucial for businesses that depend on commercial fleets. By adopting advanced technologies like Motive s, companies can overcome the challenges of underutilization, cut operational costs, and get the most out of their investments.\n",

            "Personal conveyance PC refers to a driver using a commercial motor vehicle CMV while off-duty. Since they re done with work, this may not seem like a big deal. Yet any time in the vehicle is federally regulated to promote road safety. nbsp Drivers and fleet managers must understand the rules to remain compliant and avoid penalties or fines. Read on to learn the basics of PC. Personal conveyance rules and regulations A driver can only record time spent driving a CMV as personal conveyance when relieved from duty. They can not be doing any work for the motor carrier, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA . nbsp The FMCSA s 49 CFR 395.8 Driver s Record of Duty Status does allow drivers to use CMVs, even if they are carrying a load, so long as the movement is not benefiting the motor carrier. Appropriate examples include Traveling from lodging to restaurants Commuting from a driver s residence to terminals, work sites, or trailer drop-lots Driving to a nearby, reasonable, safe location to rest nbsp Moving a CMV at a safety official s request Transporting personal property while off duty Simplify compliance with Motive. Personal conveyance FAQs The rules around this status can confuse drivers and carriers. To help out, this section answers some frequently asked questions about the guidelines. nbsp 1. What is personal conveyance? It s considered PC when a driver moves a CMV when no longer carrying out work for the carrier. It means the driver is moving the vehicle for personal reasons. nbsp 2. How does personal conveyance work? Before the electronic logging device ELD mandate , drivers simply logged personal conveyance. That s all that was needed. Now, with ELDs, the FMCSA outlines expectations for yard moves and authorized personal use. nbsp Time spent under personal conveyance is off-duty time under hours-of-service rules . 3. Can I use this status to go home? The return trip home after unloading to the terminal on a dispatched trip is considered a continuation of the trip. Therefore, it cannot be considered personal conveyance. nbsp 4. Can I use PC after 14 hours? Drivers can only use personal conveyance when off-duty. As a result, it can not impact on-duty time or a driver s available HOS hours . A driver who runs out of hours can only use personal conveyance to drive to a nearby, safe location to park and obtain adequate rest. Drivers can t use personal conveyance to extend the duty day. nbsp nbsp 5. When can I not use personal conveyance? The FMCSA offers several examples of instances that would not qualify. These include Moving the CMV to enhance motor carrier operational readiness nbsp Driving to collect a towed unit after delivering a different towed unit nbsp Bobtailing or operating with an empty trailer while going to collect a load or position the CMV in preparation for its next trip Driving with passengers on board nbsp Transporting a vehicle to a maintenance site Driving to a place of rest when out of service unless an enforcement officer requires the driver to move the CMV Returning to the motor carrier terminal after loading or unloading Operating a motorcoach to deliver luggage after passengers have disembarked 6. Can I use personal conveyance during a 34-hour reset? PC is off-duty time, so drivers can use it during a 34-hour reset . Still, the FMCSA notes , operating a commercial motor vehicle while ill or fatigued remains prohibited. nbsp nbsp 7. Does personal conveyance count against a 10-hour break? PC doesn t count against a break as it reflects off-duty time. Still, there could be a situation when a safety official requires a driver to move a vehicle while on a break. In that case, the driver can count the driving as personal conveyance. 8. Can I use PC to pick up a load? If you are allowed to take a truck home you can. You could use PC to commute to your working location e.g., company terminal to collect cargo. 9. How long can I drive on PC? In the United States, carriers can set their own limits for their fleets and drivers. Those policies just have to comply with the FMCSA regulations. In Canada , commercial drivers are limited to 75 km 46.6 miles of personal conveyance per day. 10. Can I use personal conveyance to find parking? Drivers can t use this status to advance the carrier s operational readiness. If drivers seek out parking that advances the load, that would not be off-duty driving. Don t worry, though, if a driver is in an unsafe location and out of hours, they can use PC. To get to the nearest safe parking, drivers can go off-duty and move the vehicle under PC. nbsp A common way of running afoul of personal conveyance rules is to continue down the road looking for a rest area. This can be construed as furthering the load. CDL Legal suggests it is safer to return to the last rest area you passed. Or, stop and do a web search for the best, closest spots. nbsp 11. Can I use personal conveyance while in my sleeper berth? The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations FMCSRs require drivers to document their HOS identifying one of four duty status options on-duty not driving driving sleeper berth off-duty This is an off-duty status. So, it does not work with sleeper berth or on-duty not driving status. 12. Can I use this status with an empty trailer? Current FMCSA regulations say the CMV can be loaded with freight or not. The important factor is not what s in the trailer, rather whether the driver is on- or off-duty. Personal conveyance only applies to off-duty time. 13. Does personal conveyance start your clock? Drivers may need to move their vehicles during off-duty time. Recording this time as personal conveyance avoids starting the driver s available hours-of-service clock. 14. How do I use the Motive Driver App to record PC? Enable drivers to record this status, by first logging into the Motive Fleet Management Dashboard. Start at the Admin menu, then select Drivers, and Options. Under Options, you ll use the Edit Account window to make changes. This tutorial shows you step-by-step instructions . Once managers have enabled PC, individual drivers will be able to record their status and movement in the Motive Driver App .

            "Discover the top 10 most hazardous roads for commercial vehicles in the U.S. and proactive safety tips fleet managers can use to protect drivers on these routes.\n",
            "Ensuring road safety is one of the most significant challenges for fleet managers and commercial drivers. With the rise in commercial vehicle traffic and increasing collision rates in specific areas, understanding high-risk zones is crucial for proactive safety management. nbsp Based on data from more than 1.3 million commercial drivers who use the Motive platform , certain highways and intersections across the United States pose a substantial risk to commercial drivers, primarily due to factors like heavy traffic, poor visibility, weather conditions, and aggressive driving. Let s take a closer look at the top 10 most dangerous roadway s for commercial vehicles, and how to protect your drivers on these routes. The most dangerous roadways in America 1. Highway 41 amp Highway 997, Tamiami, FL 76.2 collisions per 1,000 vehicles. Known for its challenging driving conditions and proximity to the Tamiami Trail the stretch of road connecting Tampa to Miami this highway sees one of the highest collision rates in the U.S. due to poor visibility and speeding. 2. Highway 41 amp Highway 997, Kendall West, FL 69.31 collisions per 1,000 vehicles Not far from the Tamiami Trail, this stretch in Kendall West also sees high collision rates due to similar conditions, made worse by heavy traffic congestion. 3. Highway 285 amp Highway 302, Pecos, TX 32.17 collisions per 1,000 vehicles This roadway in the Permian Basin is infamous for high collision rates that have earned it a not-so-friendly nickname Death Highway. A magnet for oilfield traffic and hazardous weather, drivers who frequent these roads must be vigilant. 4. Highway 285, Carlsbad, NM 31.49 collisions per 1,000 vehicles The treacherous conditions on this stretch continue from Texas into New Mexico, making it one of the most dangerous highways for commercial drivers. 5. Highway 880 amp Highway 101, San Jose, CA 29.64 collisions per 1,000 vehicles California s busy intersections, especially those connecting major highways near San Jose, are prone to high collision rates due to congestion and speeding. 6. Highway 181 amp Highway 123, Floresville, TX 29.64 collisions per 1,000 vehicles This intersection in Texas is notorious for aggressive driving and collisions, making it imperative for drivers to be extra cautious and aware. nbsp 7.

For example, Los Angeles, with 11.4 collisions per month, had the highest rate, followed by Detroit at 6.5. Interestingly, in all but one city observed, the areas near major airports consistently ranked as high-risk zones. Los Angeles 4.6 monthly collisions near the airport Detroit 7.2 collisions at the I-75 I-375 intersection These high-risk areas emphasize the importance of defensive driving and the need for effective driver coaching. 5 tips for fleet and safety managers to keep drivers safe Given the hazardous conditions on America s roadways, especially in high-collision areas, fleet and safety managers must prioritize driver coaching to ensure the safety of their team and reduce accidents. Here are five essential tips to help drivers navigate these high-risk environments. 1. Emphasize defensive driving techniques. Defensive driving is crucial in high-risk zones like busy intersections and dangerous highways. Drivers should be taught to create space around their vehicles, maintain safe following distances, and stay alert to sudden changes in traffic flow. Since larger commercial vehicles require more stopping time, fleet managers should remind drivers to leave at least one second of distance for every 10 feet of vehicle length. 2. Use safety technology for real-time alerts . Incorporating video telematics and AI-powered dash cams into your safety program can significantly improve safety outcomes by providing real-time alerts on unsafe driving behaviors like close following , speeding , and unsafe lane changes . These alerts can act as a critical tool to prevent accidents, ensuring that drivers are continuously aware of their surroundings and perform safely on the road. 3. Coach drivers on avoiding aggressive drivers . Aggressive driving is a common cause of accidents, especially on highways and at busy intersections. Train drivers to stay calm and patient when dealing with aggressive drivers. Remind them to reflect on the situation, remain calm, and safely move away from the situation by creating space or pulling over if necessary. 4. Encourage the use of dash cams for documentation . Dash cams are invaluable for documenting unsafe actions by other drivers. Train your fleet to use dash cams as a defensive tool. Drivers can manually activate the dash cam to capture aggressive behavior from others on the road, which can serve as evidence against false claims. 5. Prioritize regular safety reviews and driver coaching . Continuous driver coaching is the key to maintaining safety on the road. Motive s turnkey coaching tool automatically identifies drivers and behaviors that require attention. Regular safety reviews, coupled with real-time feedback from video telematics, will instill safe driving habits and reduce the likelihood of accidents. The Motive Safety Score makes it easy to see at a glance who s improving or in need of coaching. Conclusion Navigating dangerous roadways is part of the daily challenge for commercial drivers. By identifying the most hazardous highways and intersections, fleet managers can better prepare their drivers for the risks they face on the road. Offering continuous coaching, reinforcing defensive driving techniques, and implementing advanced safety tools like AI dash cams, will go a long way in protecting your drivers and your business.

Without the right system, the time-consuming nature of reviewing video footage often leaves little room for effective, targeted coaching. The administrative burden of tracking coaching conversations and monitoring driver progress can be overwhelming. Additionally, assessing whether individual drivers or the entire fleet are truly improving is no small feat. When drivers perform poorly in compliance and safety , it adds additional risk to your organization. nbsp It s important to have clear visibility into both compliance and safety when it comes to driver performance it helps with better coaching and reducing risks. On top of everything, there s no single platform for coaching. Managers end up juggling different tools or relying on clunky spreadsheets, which makes things inefficient. For large fleets it s even harder to coach at scale without knowing which drivers need extra attention. And the most frustrating part? The whole process is manual and takes several steps just to follow up with drivers and track actions. nbsp Our customers have expressed a desire for a more streamlined and integrated approach. They have highlighted the ease and user-friendliness of having all safety events and compliance coaching in one place. This consolidation not only simplifies the coaching process but also improves communication and documentation within safety teams, allowing for more efficient collaboration and better tracking of driver progress.

As coaching for additional critical areas, like fuel efficiency, become available, they will be added to the same workflow so coaches can make the most of their time with drivers. nbsp For Safety, the Coaching tab shows unsafe driving patterns and includes Pro Tips to explain each behavior, the risks involved, and how to prevent them. The Mobile Driver App helps drivers improve by letting them see their own safety events. Soon, the app will include Motive Coach, which will automatically send drivers targeted coaching videos when unsafe behaviors are repeated. Driver Safety Profiles also provide a quick snapshot of Safety Scores and track unsafe behaviors over time. Bringing everything together, the system centralizes all coaching activities for both safety and compliance. Managers can easily spot logs that need attention with the new Coaching Status column, which makes identifying issues a breeze. Updating coaching status is now easier than ever. Each log has a Coaching Status button, making it simple to track progress. For example, logs with HOS violations or Form amp Manner Errors automatically get a Needs Review status. Logs that need further attention can be marked as Coachable, while logs with no issues are labeled Not Coachable. nbsp Once coaching is completed, they are marked as Coached, and any logs that don t need further action can be dismissed. With Integrated Coaching, you can now include compliance behaviors like HOS Violations and Form amp Manner Errors in your coaching sessions, giving you a more well-rounded approach to driver improvement. Plus, tracking progress is easier with compliance coaching reports, which let you review coaching logs and measure the effectiveness of your coaching over time. There is a place for notes so you have a record of the conversation for future reference. nbsp The new features have resonated well with our customers, particularly those managing less experienced drivers who struggle with hours of service compliance. Since using Motive s Integrated Coaching feature, I ve been able to coach drivers more quickly, helping them learn from their mistakes and avoid repeating them, said John Haverstick, Safety Recruiting IT Manager at Miller Expedited Freight.

            "Discover upcoming changes to FMCSA s Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse starting Nov 18, 2024. Included are expanded state access stricter enforcement. Learn how these updates will impact drivers and fleets.\n",
            "The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration s FMCSA Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse is a vital database that helps improve safety on the nation s roadways by maintaining records of drug and alcohol violations committed by commercial drivers. Since its launch in January 2020, the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse has been an important tool for employers and enforcement agencies looking to track drivers with substance abuse violations and take appropriate action. nbsp To improve compliance and road safety, the FMCSA is implementing several changes to the Clearinghouse. In this blog post, we ll explore the planned changes and let you know what to expect. What is the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse? The Drug amp Alcohol Clearinghouse is an online database that maintains a record of all drug and alcohol testing violations committed by holders of Commercial Driver s Licenses and Commercial Learner s Permits. The Clearinghouse aims to prevent drivers with unresolved violations from operating commercial vehicles. It s also intended to give employers a centralized location to conduct pre-employment and annual queries on their drivers histories. Commercial fleets must report drug and alcohol violations and record negative return-to-duty tests for any CDL driver expected to operate a vehicle. Besides the FMCSA, state driver licensing agencies and law enforcement also have access to the Clearinghouse. Upcoming changes to the Clearinghouse FMCSA is planning a series of changes to the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse to address operational challenges, improve data accessibility, and ensure stricter compliance. Here are the main changes drivers and employers need to know as the changes become effective November 18, 2024 . 1. Expansion of state access to data One of the most notable changes is the expansion of access to Clearinghouse records. Under the new regulations, state driver licensing agencies will have direct access to the Clearinghouse, allowing them to quickly identify unresolved violations or return-to-duty test information before they process license applications or changes. nbsp Impact on Drivers This change will make it harder for drivers with drug or alcohol violations to slip through the cracks by moving between states to obtain a new CDL, or job hopping to other carriers. If you have unresolved violations in one state, that information will be accessible nationwide. Impact on Commercial Fleets Fleets may see fewer issues with hiring drivers who might have previously evaded the system due to lack of state-level coordination. State driver licensing agencies will have more authority to deny or revoke CDLs if drivers don t comply with drug testing requirements, providing employers with a more compliant pool of qualified drivers. 2. Mandatory queries by state driver licensing agencies Another important change involves mandatory queries that state driver licensing agencies will be required to conduct. Previously, it was up to motor carriers to check the Clearinghouse before hiring drivers and annually thereafter. However, the state driver licensing agencies weren t required to perform checks. nbsp With the new rules, agencies will now be required to run a Clearinghouse query whenever a driver applies for a new CDL, a renewal, or an upgraded CDL. This means that any unresolved substance abuse violations will be flagged before the CDL process can move forward. nbsp FMCSA will also push information to the state driver licensing agency whenever a drug or alcohol violation is reported to the Clearinghouse for a driver licensed in that state. The state agency will then be required to begin the CDL downgrade process. Drivers listed in the Clearinghouse as being prohibited from operating a vehicle won t be able to complete the desired licensing action until they ve passed a return-to-duty drug or alcohol test and it s been reported to the Clearinghouse. nbsp Impact on Drivers Drivers will need to resolve any violations or complete the return-to-duty process promptly, as the state driver license agencies will actively prevent CDL transactions until the Clearinghouse record is cleared. This added layer of checks could delay the process of obtaining or renewing a CDL if any issues are found. Impact on Commercial Fleets This change helps businesses ensure that their drivers are in full compliance with the law. It provides an additional safeguard that the drivers they hire or continue to employ have not had any recent drug or alcohol testing violations that were unreported or missed by the employer. 3. Enforcement and penalties Employers who fail to run required queries or report violations could face fines or penalties. Additionally, drivers who falsify information or fail to comply with the return-to-duty process may face consequences, including suspension of their CDL privileges. Impact on Drivers Drivers who attempt to bypass the system by failing to report violations, not completing their return-to-duty process, or moving between states or employers to avoid scrutiny will face penalties. They may even be barred from holding a CDL. It will be essential for drivers to stay compliant and keep track of their Clearinghouse status. Impact on Employers Fleets should conduct all required Clearinghouse checks and report violations promptly. Failing to do so could result in liability and financial penalties. It also emphasizes the need for companies to stay on top of their compliance procedures to avoid enforcement action or liability. Conclusion Preparing for the changes The impending changes to the DOT Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse are designed to improve safety, accountability, and compliance in the transportation industry. For drivers, staying on top of any violations and completing the return-to-duty process will be crucial to avoiding disruptions to their CDL privileges. For employers, it will be more important than ever to comply with the Clearinghouse requirements if they want to avoid penalties and preserve the safety of their operations. By understanding these upcoming changes, drivers and motor carriers can take the necessary steps to stay compliant, avoid penalties, and contribute to safer roadways for all.\n",

            "Accidents are chaotic. Motive s telematics provides real-time crash detection, emergency response, and data for fleet managers to protect drivers and their business.\n",
            "When a crash happens, the immediate moments following the impact can be chaotic and overwhelming. Dust, debris, and disorientation flood the senses, making quick, clear decision-making difficult. In these critical seconds, time is everything, whether it s for summoning emergency services, collecting accurate data, or ensuring the safety of the driver. What happens during a crash The driver s experience In the moments following a crash, drivers often experience a whirlwind of sensations shock, confusion, and disorientation. Dust fills the air, airbags may deploy, and communication devices can be lost or malfunction due to damage. For drivers, every second matters. Devices may be damaged or lost, making it difficult to contact help. In severe accidents, doors may jam, or the vehicle may be positioned in a way that prevents the driver from escaping. Drivers may be injured or disoriented, and unable to take proper action. In situations like these, timely and accurate data, along with the right fleet safety tools , can make all the difference. Motive immediately and accurately detects crashes, assesses the severity, and sends real-time data to fleet managers, empowering them to respond effectively and potentially save lives. Motive s crash detection and emergency response Once a crash is detected by Motive s system, an email is automatically sent to fleet managers with precise crash details, including location, vehicle identification, and the severity of the crash. This critical data allows fleets to jump into action without delay. Motive s First Responder feature One of Motive s most powerful features during severe crashes is the First Responder feature , which facilitates the rapid dispatch of emergency services. When a severe collision is detected, fleet and safety managers receive a notification with all necessary details about the crash. They can then initiate an emergency call directly from the Motive platform to the local emergency dispatcher nearest to the accident scene, bypassing the usual administrative wait times.

            "Learn how retail trends help businesses tackle supply chain challenges and meet consumer demand.\n",
            "The retail industry has been forced to adapt quickly to constant disruption, and supply chain resilience has become a core focus. In 2024, retailers are using new strategies to tackle ongoing challenges like prolonged bottlenecks and extreme weather events, which can disrupt the holiday season. Shifting priorities Stability over cost-cutting Retailers are prioritizing stability over cost savings, moving away from the traditional low-inventory restocking model. nbsp Instead, they re restocking earlier and building extra inventory to shield themselves from disruption. A 19.7 year-over-year increase in Chinese imports by mid-summer underscored this shift, showing that businesses are willing to invest more to meet demand. The surge in Chinese imports represents a broader trend in supply chain management. By sourcing earlier and holding more stock, retailers are preparing for the unexpected, especially during the high-stakes holiday season. Mexico s expanding role in U.S. retail supply chains As retailers diversify their supply chains, Mexico s become a key player. Motive s September Economic Report shows a 30 year-over-year increase in imports from Mexico through the Port of Laredo. Retailers are turning to Mexico for its shorter lead times, lower tariffs, and to reduce the risks associated with other global supply chains. By strategically balancing imports from both China and Mexico, retailers are minimizing risk and creating more resilient supply chains. Chinese imports help maintain inventory stability during high demand, while Mexican imports provide a quicker, more flexible option to avoid potential disruption. As supply chain disruption becomes more frequent, proactive planning and diversification become more important. Retailers that adapt will protect their holiday sales often accounting for 30 to 50 of annual revenue and build more resilient supply chains in an unpredictable global environment. Our Take In 2025, we expect continued adjustments in inventory management and cross-border trade. Retailers are likely to further distance themselves from the just-in-time model, opting for higher inventory-to-sales ratios, which are predicted to climb above 1.3 by the end of 2024 and remain high throughout 2025. Meanwhile, imports from Mexico are expected to keep rising. Cross-border trucking activity will peak in early 2025. Early restocking and strong demand set up for growth As the holiday season approaches, retailers expect a surge in consumer demand , supported by strong early restocking efforts that began in June. It was the first time since 2021 that the pre-holiday restocking blitz started so early, signaling that retailers are prepared for a successful season. With a strong labor market, falling interest rates, and cooling inflation, consumers have a positive outlook. Spending has remained steady and shows no sign of slowing. Early restocking, combined with solid consumer confidence, suggests a booming shopping season ahead. Our Take Motive expects an increase in in-store shopping this holiday season, with brick-and-mortar stores seeing notable growth. Following a brief two-day strike by the International Longshoremen s Association , holiday sales are back on track. Thanks to a surge in imports through the Port of Los Angeles in July and August, sales are projected to grow by 5 to 8 this year. If summer trends persist, grocery, superstores, department stores, and home improvement retailers are set to drive the most growth. Grocery and superstores, in particular, hit an all-time high in restocking in August, up 22.6 year-over-year, while department stores and apparel surged by 27.1 . Home improvement stores saw an 11.2 month-over-month increase in restocking from August to September, reaching a 29.3 rise since 2023. Our Take As we move into 2025, retail prices are expected to rise, driven by increased freight and transportation costs. Retailers will pass these expenses on to consumers early in the year, even as inflation cools. Conclusion The retail industry faces a complex landscape that rewards flexibility and proactive planning. From early restocking to strategic partnerships with Mexico, retailers are building strategies that will define their resilience in the coming years. Retailers that invest in robust, diversified supply chains and remain attentive to changing consumer demands will be best positioned to thrive in the face of future disruption. nbsp Prepare your fleet for 2025 read the full report now.\n",

            "Years ago, when I started my trucking company, we hauled a lot of intermodal freight from ports, especially in Virginia. In 2015, my driver dropped a container full of tobacco on the side of the road in Portsmouth, Virginia. He returned five minutes later, and the container was gone. The fallout was catastrophic. I ended up paying 15,000 in chassis rental charges and 25,000 in container fees, with no way to recover the lost freight. We lost a major customer, saw our insurance premiums rise, and faced significant challenges at renewal. Cargo and equipment theft aren t just inconveniences they re significant threats to the transportation, energy, and construction industries that can devastate a business s bottom line. With theft rising across the country, the need for tighter security measures is imperative. The growing problem of cargo and equipment theft Cargo theft is at an all-time high , and recent statistics emphasize the severity of the problem In the first half of 2024, cargo theft increased 49 compared to the same period in 2023. The average loss per incident was 115,230, an 83 increase from the same period in 2023. Cargo theft is increasing in states that are major logistics and transport hubs, such as California, Texas, and Illinois. In North America, cargo theft incidents rose by 15 in 2023 compared to the previous year, with an estimated loss of over 223 million in stolen goods. In Mexico, cargo theft is rampant, with more than 20,000 reported cases annually . This has driven up costs for carriers , resulting in higher insurance premiums, and the loss of customer trust. In the United States, cities like Chicago and Los Angeles have become hot spots for theft, with thieves targeting everything from electronics to household goods. Equipment theft is also a concern, especially in construction and agriculture. According to the National Equipment Register, equipment theft remains a widespread problem, with 6.3 million worth of equipment stolen across more than 300 locations just during the 4th of July holiday in 2024. This trend tells us that theft can happen anywhere, anytime, often targeting high-value equipment. The National Equipment Register and National Insurance Crime Bureau estimate that construction equipment theft costs the industry between 300 million and 1 billion each year, with a recovery rate of less than 25 . Real-world impact As an enterprise carrier, I experienced the effects of asset and equipment theft and not having the right tracking vendors for recovery. Before we switched to Motive, we used a different vendor, and it took almost eight months to recover a stolen vehicle. The financial loss, operational downtime, and stress impact service and the bottom line. The four vehicles we had stolen after investing in Motive were recovered immediately. Some even had amazing footage of the high-speed chase, which led to the recovery of the vehicle and prosecution of the culprits. In the construction industry , the theft of high-visibility heavy equipment results in substantial financial loss and project delays. However, a construction company that implemented GPS tracking was able to recover stolen equipment worth 5 million. This demonstrates the effectiveness of using AI-powered technology to prevent theft and recover assets. In June 2024, a Prince George s County, MD man was arrested with nearly 20 pieces of stolen commercial heavy equipment valued at 1 million. These stories are not unique. Theft obviously has its losses, but increased insurance premiums, lost customer trust, and even business failure are real threats.

            "The trucking industry is on a slow path to recovery. Learn about current challenges, carrier exits, and what to expect for 2025 growth and stability.\n",
            "The trucking industry plays a critical role in keeping goods moving and supporting economic growth, but it s not without its challenges. Over the past year, market dynamics have shifted, shaped by factors such as changing demand, economic uncertainty, and industry-specific pressures. Such changes have tested the resilience of carriers, shippers, and other stakeholders across the sector. Now, the trucking market is showing signs of stabilization. Though obstacles like fluctuating freight volumes and rising costs persist, the industry continues to adapt. Understanding these trends and their potential impacts is key to navigating the road ahead and positioning your fleet for long-term success. Let s dive into the State of Freight. Trucking market outlook Challenges persist, but signs of recovery emerge The trucking market had a challenging year, but 2024 looks set to end on a more positive note. While we expected to see growth in the trucking sector by November 2024, stagnant freight prices and carrier exits have slowed the rebound slightly. Expect moderate growth to return in the first quarter and long-term growth trends of 5.7 , year over year, to be restored by the end of 2025. As the oversupply of carriers eases, the market is returning to pre-2020 cyclical trends. However, global economic uncertainty is still an issue, along with fluctuating interest rates and diesel prices. Carrier exits remain high, and new entries are slow In September, for the third consecutive month, about 1,300 operators were shuttered. Low trucking rates continued to put pressure on small businesses, causing them to close. Financial strains have made it tough for operators to stay afloat, and new carrier entries have been lackluster. In fact, new carrier entries have declined by 5.1 since August, even with 7,800 of them entering the market. Still, even though new entries are down 10 year over year, they re 38 higher than pre-pandemic levels. By August, the average age of carriers leaving the market rose to 3 years, up from 1.5 years at the start of the freight recession . This trend suggests a gradual return to more typical business cycles as the recession eases. Nonetheless, companies older than 3 are struggling. In 2024, 50 of carrier exits involved these businesses, compared to 37 in 2023. For many, cash flow challenges and falling rates have been the primary drivers of closure. Regional impacts show diverging trends Some states have been harder hit than others during this period of adjustment. Southern states, particularly Georgia and Texas, have seen substantial declines in operations, with Georgia down 7.2 and Texas seeing a 4.3 decrease. By contrast, Indiana stands out as one of the few top-10 trucking markets to experience growth, remaining relatively insulated from both the trucking boom and the subsequent freight recession. The outlook for 2025 Stabilization on the horizon As we look to 2025, expectations are cautiously optimistic. The strong consumer demand anticipated during the holiday season will drive short-term freight growth. Expect a slight dip in new carrier entries as many wait until the new year to begin operations. nbsp Rising freight rates projected for next year are likely to stabilize the market, allowing older trucking companies with more established cash reserves to remain resilient. However, newer operators, especially in high-cost states like California and Texas, may face ongoing challenges. Increased operational costs and competition could lead to higher turnover for these younger companies, testing their ability to adapt in a stabilizing but competitive landscape. Our take The trucking industry is on the path to recovery, but the journey is likely to be gradual and marked by a period of adjustment. Strong consumer demand in the short term may help lift freight volumes through the holiday season, while rising freight rates in 2025 should bring some stability. Established operators are better positioned to weather this phase, but newer entrants in high-cost regions may need to adapt quickly to avoid the pitfalls that caused others to exit.

One thing all businesses have in common, however, is the care that goes into handling heavy-haul shipments. Here are some examples of heavy-haul loads and their requirements, from industry to industry. Industrial Machinery Equipment such as turbines, presses, and generators requires sturdy trailers due to their high density, often compact yet extremely heavy structures. Construction Equipment Moving large machinery like cranes and bulldozers requires trailers that can handle both size and weight. Oversized Steel and Concrete Structures Because bridge beams, pipes, and concrete panels are large and heavy, transporting them poses a big challenge, especially on narrow or winding routes. Energy and Aerospace Components During transport, irregularly shaped items, such as wind turbine blades or rocket parts, need custom securement solutions that might include cradles, saddles, tensions straps or blade trailers. During transit, Motive s AI-powered technology allows operators to continuously monitor equipment condition, maintain the security of cargo, and limit potential hazards. The importance of load density and configuration In heavy-haul transportation, it s really important to consider load density, or the weight-to-size ratio. Load density affects equipment choice, weight distribution, and securement methods in several ways. Here are some examples High-Density Loads Compact but heavy loads need trailers with strong axle configurations to support concentrated weight. Low-Density Loads Longer, lighter items, like turbine blades, require trailers that provide spatial efficiency without compromising balance. Selecting the right trailer, based on load density and configuration, helps reduce strain by distributing weight over a larger area. As a result, drivers can have a safer journey. With Motive s fleet management dashboard , fleet managers can continuously track the assets in their fleet. That means they can better support load configurations to maintain a more even distribution of axle weight and limit damage during transport. Important equipment in heavy-haul transport In heavy-haul trucking, specialized equipment is used to accommodate oversized loads, including Lowboy Trailers With a low deck height, lowboys transport tall loads that would otherwise exceed height restrictions. Multi-Axle and Extendable Trailers Extra axles and expandable decks accommodate heavier or longer loads, distributing weight evenly. Modular Trailers and Self-Propelled Modular Transporters SPMTs Modular setups allow for flexible axle configurations, while SPMTs provide precise control for heavy, high-stakes cargo over short distances. Motive s fleet tracking and equipment monitoring make it easier to manage diverse trailer types and improve efficiency. Permitting requirements for heavy-haul freight Fleets that transport heavy-haul freight must adhere to an array of federal, state, and local regulations. Key permit types include Single-Trip Permits Required per state for individual oversized loads, valid for specific routes only. Multi-State Permits Allow travel across multiple states, though with strict adherence to specified load limits. Annual Permits Ideal for repeat routes within set parameters, though they re not always feasible for extreme loads. Challenges in heavy-haul freight The challenges of heavy-haul trucking are drastically different from other types of operations, where standard freight is the focus. Heavy-haul operators have several unique concerns, including Equipment Availability Heavy-haul equipment is specialized and often scarce. Carriers invest in custom-built trailers to meet diverse load demands. Route Planning and Permitting Logistics To ensure safety and legal compliance, route selection must consider bridge capacities, weight limits, and other restrictions. Safety Protocols The large dimensions and weight of heavy-haul loads increase the risk of accidents, making it all the more important for fleets to comply with the North American Cargo Standard and others. By providing real-time visibility, Motive s solutions facilitate better route planning, making it easier for businesses to adhere to curfews, bridge limitations, and weight restrictions or to avoid spills, accidents, and slow downs. Maintaining compliance and stability Load Securement in heavy-haul trucking should adhere to high standards to prevent load shifts, tipping, or structural damage. Effective methods include Chains, Straps, and Binders Essential for stabilizing loads, with multiple layers of securement often needed for heavier cargo. Blocking and Bracing Dense loads, such as machinery, require blocking and bracing for added stability during transit. Hydraulic Systems for Leveling Certain trailers use hydraulics to keep loads balanced, especially on uneven terrain. By monitoring load securement with the Motive AI Omnicam , fleet managers gain visibility into cargo safety throughout the journey. The AI Omnicam s high-definition, 360-degree camera system ensures that load securement can be inspected while in transit, providing a detailed view of straps, chains, and other tie-down mechanisms. Route planning and logistics in heavy haul Route planning in heavy-haul trucking is highly specialized, especially because oversized loads can t travel standard routes. As a result, fleets that transport heavy-haul loads must make important considerations, such as the following Survey and Planning Roads must be surveyed for bridge limits, clearances, and turn capabilities. Tools like Motive s GPS tracking and route mapping make planning easier, ensuring compliance with curfews and road restrictions. Weather Monitoring Inclement weather often puts oversized loads at risk, whether due to strong winds or slick roads. The weather overlay in the Motive Fleet Dashboard provides real-time updates, so managers can adjust routes for hazardous conditions proactively. Pilot and Escort Vehicles Escorts are often needed to manage traffic around oversized vehicles, ensuring road safety. State laws mandate the use of escorts based on the vehicle s load dimensions, often adding to the complexity of planning. Heavy-haul costs and budgeting Heavy-haul transportation isn t cheap, making budgeting an essential aspect of planning. The most common costs associated with this type of transport include Fuel and Maintenance Costs Heavy loads increase fuel consumption and wear, requiring regular maintenance on brakes, tires, and powertrains. Permit and Escort Fees Fees vary by state and load type. Multi-state trips can cost thousands of dollars. Insurance Premiums High-value loads demand comprehensive insurance to cover the risk of accidents or damage, increasing the overall cost of transport. Leveraging technology with Motive Technology is revolutionizing heavy-haul trucking, enabling real-time monitoring and proactive fleet management . Motive s platform offers Real-Time GPS and Tracking Keep track of load location, speed, and route adherence, especially critical for managing complex, multi-state trips.

            "The Compliance, Safety, Accountability CSA program, managed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA , offers a comprehensive overview of a motor carrier s safety record. While final CSA scores aren t publicly accessible, performance data is available, and adverse information can impede business growth. Understanding and managing your CSA score is crucial for driver retention and profitability. How Expressway Logistics reduced its CSA score by 40 with Motive. What is a CSA score for drivers? The CSA program aims to enhance safety for carriers and the public by meticulously recording safety metrics. A motor carrier s CSA score reflects their overall safety performance, with higher scores indicating poorer safety records. Viewing your CSA score as a tool for improvement rather than a burden can lead to significant benefits in the industry. The BASICs behind the CSA FMCSA program Launched in November 2010, the CSA program enforces FMCSA s compliance standards to promote safety. The program evaluates seven Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories BASICs Unsafe Driving Reckless or careless operation of vehicles. Crash Indicator Histories or patterns of high crash involvement. Hours-of-Service HOS Compliance Non-compliance with HOS regulations. Vehicle Maintenance Failure to properly maintain equipment. Controlled Substances Alcohol Use or possession of controlled substances alcohol. Hazardous Materials Compliance Unsafe handling of hazardous materials.

            "Discover proven strategies to pass a DOT safety audit, stay updated on FMCSA regulations, and learn how fleet management technology like Motive can streamline compliance.\n",
            "Managing a commercial fleet means facing DOT audits as part of doing business. Whether you re an owner-operator or oversee a large fleet, preparation is critical. Failing a DOT audit can result in steep penalties, including losing operating authority or being placed out of service. In this updated guide, we ll share useful strategies to prepare for a DOT audit, highlight recent FMCSA regulatory updates, and show how fleet management technology like Motive can streamline compliance efforts. What is a DOT audit? The DOT audit ensures that fleets comply with federal safety regulations. It s conducted by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA to identify carriers with safety risks. Audits can be triggered by poor CSA scores, complaints, or at random. There are two main types of audits New Entrant Safety Audit Mandatory for new carriers within the first 18 months of obtaining a USDOT number. Compliance Review Conducted for established carriers based on risk factors or violations. Failing a DOT audit can result in fines, suspension of operations, or even revocation of your USDOT number. Updated categories of a DOT audit Audits focus on the six regulatory categories below. Staying updated on recent regulatory changes can give you an edge in passing your audit. 1. General Proof of adequate insurance coverage is mandatory. The FMCSA recently clarified that insurance levels for non-hazardous freight remain at a minimum of 750,000 , while hazmat carriers may need up to 5 million in coverage. 2. Driver Records Maintain up-to-date CDL licenses and records of drug and alcohol testing. Ensure compliance with the Drug amp Alcohol Clearinghouse requirements for pre-employment and random testing. 3. Hours of Service HOS The DOT now accepts electronic logging device ELD records exclusively for HOS compliance. Paper logs are no longer permitted unless under specific exemptions. 4. Vehicle Maintenance Keep detailed records of annual DOT inspections , preventive maintenance schedules, and driver vehicle inspection reports DVIRs . 5. Hazardous Materials Stay current with training requirements for drivers transporting hazardous materials. As of 2022, FMCSA requires carriers to integrate updated hazmat security protocols into their operations. 6. Accidents Log all reportable crashes involving injuries, fatalities, or vehicle towing. How to prepare for a DOT audit 1. Create a Centralized Compliance System Organizing your records is critical. Use fleet management technology to create a digital repository for documents, including Insurance policies Driver qualification files Pre-employment drug and alcohol test results Maintenance logs 2.

By combining vehicle telematics data with transaction data, Motive provides a comprehensive view of your fleet s operations and costs in real time . This holistic approach enables us to identify fraud with unprecedented accuracy and speed. Stop fraud before it occurs. Vehicle amp Spend Location Mismatch provides an essential layer of security against fraud, with new alerts and auto-decline controls if the vehicle location does not match the fuel card transaction. Respond faster to suspicious activity Fuel Type Mismatch, and Fuel Level amp Spend Mismatch alerts fleet managers to suspicious activity. Fraudulent spend includes purchasing gasoline when the company vehicle is a diesel truck, or fueling up after alerts show the tank is already full. In such instances, Motive alerts fleet managers and allows them to lock the card or block the merchant. Control spend in real time Category Level Spend Limits let you set customized spending limits for different categories and timeframes to maintain strict control over your fleet s expenses. For example, you can set lower limits at home improvement or grocery stores, and higher limits for fuel and maintenance spend. Ensure that every transaction aligns with your fleet s policies and budget. Increase profits with a holistic view Making all of this possible is the integration of vehicle telematics and spend transactions in one platform. This gives fleet managers a comprehensive view of all fleet activity, control to identify and stop unauthorized spending, and proven opportunities to improve profit margins, savings, and operational efficiency.

            "Learn essential commercial driving safety tips for truck and vehicle fleets to reduce accidents, enhance driver well-being, and improve overall fleet safety.\n",
            "Safety is a big concern to everyone on the road, and for commercial drivers most of all. According to the National Safety Council , nearly 6,000 professional drivers were involved in fatal crashes in 2022, a 1.8 increase from the year before. Even more alarming, in the last 10 years, fatal crashes among commercial drivers have surged nearly 50 . With road risk on the rise, commercial drivers need more protection. To improve driver safety, we ve assembled a list of safety tips to discuss with your drivers. These commercial driving safety tips will help increase fleet driver safety, improve fleet risk management, and reduce the risk of collisions on the road. 1. Look ahead down the road Driving requires a level of awareness that goes beyond natural human instinct. Our eyes aren t optimized for the rapid decision-making required on the road. To stay safe, drivers should look ahead to where they ll be in at least 15 seconds. nbsp Practicing extended eye-lead time gives drivers advanced warning of potential hazards, so they can make safer decisions in critical moments. When drivers scan further ahead, it opens up a window of time for them to respond to potential dangers. Looking down the road also puts drivers in the mindset of creating space around the vehicle and practicing safe driving habits. For fleet managers Download our Ultimate Guide building a world-class fleet safety program. 2. Be aware of blind spots Adequate visibility is an important component of fleet driver safety and collision prevention especially when operating a large commercial vehicle, known to have more blind spots than a standard passenger vehicle. Increasing visibility in the vehicle can prevent accidents and save lives. Encourage your drivers to understand their vehicle s blind spots, use extra caution when changing lanes, and check their mirrors every 10 seconds. Using technology like blind-spot detection systems and backup cameras can further reduce risk, providing an added layer of security. Regular training on blind spot awareness and proper mirror adjustments will show drivers how to navigate safely in challenging conditions. 3. Keep a safe following distance The bigger the rig, the longer it takes to stop, making it all the more important for professional drivers to keep a safe distance. Compared to an average-sized car, it takes an 18-wheeler 40 longer to stop . That s a scary prospect on the road, when situations can change quickly. To make sure your drivers keep a safe following distance, invest in AI dash cams . AI dash cams can alert to close following and other unsafe behaviors in real time, so drivers can change their behavior before it causes an accident. 4. Avoid hard braking, acceleration, and cornering Hard braking, hard acceleration, and hard cornering are among the most common aggressive driving behaviors. To stay safe on the road, drivers should avoid slamming on their brakes or accelerating too harshly. Driver coaching programs can go a long way in preventing unsafe habits like these, simply by increasing driver awareness. Today s safety technologies are equipped with automated alerts and driver apps that allow drivers to self-coach without manager involvement. Fleets can also improve driver safety by tracking safety performance improvement over time. For example, the Motive AI Dashcam has a driver safety score that automatically ranks drivers according to how safely they drive. Drivers are ranked on how high their scores are, with score 100 indicating perfection. Safety managers can easily identify at-risk drivers who require immediate coaching, or recognize drivers for notable improvement. Managers can track improvement by day, week, month, or year. Through the power of AI, Motive provides accurate context for critical safety events by considering additional factors, such as location, weather, and the type of vehicle. 5. Be attentive Distracted driving gets a lot of attention in commercial transportation, and rightly so. However, according to the National Safety Council, the problem isn t distracted driving so much as inattentive driving. The act of driving takes a great deal of cognition, says Ryan Pietzsch, program technical advisor for driver safety at NSC. It s easy for drivers to allow their minds to wander, especially when traveling long distances or familiar routes. Both scenarios lead to complacency, and that s when crashes and near-misses occur. Drivers tend to be more vigilant in situations that are new or unfamiliar. To heighten driver awareness, coaches should work with drivers to make them more aware of their decisions. This is another area where video-based tools such as AI-powered dash cams can help, Pietzsch says. Through real-time alerts triggered by distracted driving and other unsafe driving behaviors AI dash cams can disrupt complacency and improve performance. 6. Stay away from tailgaters It may seem like common sense, but a big part of safe commercial driving involves avoiding aggressive drivers. If your driver has to stop suddenly, tailgaters may not be able to brake in time, potentially causing a crash. To stay away from tailgaters and avoid accidents, encourage your drivers to switch lanes, let tailgaters pass, and activate their turn signals well in advance. 7. Above all, run a safe program Out on the road, a split-second lapse is all it takes to put lives in danger. That s why it s so important for fleet management to build a comprehensive safety program that champions the latest technology and data to keep their drivers safe. In conclusion, here s a simple truck safety inspection checklist that drivers can review each time they take to the road Obey all posted speed limits. Always practice defensive driving. Don t use distracting devices while driving. Wear your seatbelt. Be well-rested. Check your vehicle before driving. Double-check your route and stick to it.

            "As the holiday season approaches, businesses operating within the physical economy face heightened risks of theft and fraud. The rise in cargo theft and credit card fraud presents a significant challenge for companies during the holidays, as financial exploitation and the threat of stolen goods including equipment, vehicles, and cargo rise. Surge in cargo theft Cargo theft surged by 49 in the first half of 2024, and the holiday season will likely aggravate it even more. Thieves often target unsecured or poorly monitored warehouses, as well as unattended vehicles during delivery. The holidays, with their higher circulation of consumer goods and valuable equipment, present a prime opportunity for crime. Businesses stretched thin on security resources are particularly vulnerable. Watch the video The power of AI in detecting cargo theft wistia-player media-id yihneqw2dx not defined background center contain no-repeat url https fast.wistia.com embed medias yihneqw2dx swatch display block filter blur 5px padding-top 56.25 Over the past five years, holiday theft trends have shown an average loss of 121,473 per incident , making these crimes a significant financial burden for companies. As a result, businesses are increasingly relying on real-time tracking technology and AI-powered security systems. These tools alerts companies to irregular activity instantly, allowing them to track vehicles and cargo in real time and recover stolen items quickly. Rise in credit card fraud for commercial vehicles The holiday season also brings heightened financial risk, particularly in the form of credit card fraud and fuel card skimming. According to Motive s Physical Economy Outlook , 44 of business leaders say fraud is having a big financial impact on their operations. Yet many don t know how to detect or address it. Fraud, especially in the form of fuel card theft , is a growing issue for companies operating fleets. Industry leaders estimate that 19 of current fleet spend is lost to fraud or theft. That figure rises to 22 in industries like construction. For businesses operating on thin margins due to fluctuating costs like fuel, maintenance, and insurance, these losses are especially painful. To mitigate them, businesses must adopt a proactive and technology-driven approach to physical and financial security. Motive blog Protect your fleet from cargo theft. Our take Businesses operating within the physical economy are becoming more aware of fraud, theft, and their impact on operations. However, a big gap remains in addressing these challenges. Amid the large transaction volumes generated by enterprise fleets, fraud often goes undetected. Insufficient monitoring of trailers, depots, and warehouses makes businesses all the more vulnerable. By adopting AI-powered technology and taking proactive measures, companies can safeguard their assets, stem financial losses, and stabilize their operations during peak season.

            "Learn how to develop technology policies that enhance safety, ensure compliance, and optimize Motive s features for organizational success.\n",
            "Creating effective technology policies is a cornerstone of organizational success. When adopting technologies like Motive s, the challenge isn t just about learning how the technology works it s about crafting policies that improve safety , compliance , and operations . Thoughtful policies ensure that your investment doesn t just work, but works for you . Here s how to build a solid framework that aligns with your goals, minimizes risks, and makes the most of Motive features. Start with a purpose Technology policies should do more than check regulatory boxes. They should actively support your organizational goals. For Motive products, that means Enhancing safety and operational performance. Reducing risks tied to liability and non-compliance. Maximizing the product s capabilities while making them easy to use. Why it matters A well-designed policy aligns with corporate culture and day-to-day realities. Engage employees at all levels when drafting policies. Get buy-in from leadership, and always involve legal counsel. This collaborative approach builds trust, maintains compliance , and makes your policies practical instead of aspirational. Core principles for technology policies When building your policies, focus on the most critical areas, like those below 1. Manage access thoughtfully Who can use your safety technology, and what can they access? Regardless of the type of the safety technology, granting access with discretion will go a long way in protecting the integrity of your data. With Motive, users can monitor and create reports , adjust settings, and access the web portal tied to each technology type. With this in mind, it s important to define roles for system use, train employees before access is granted, and immediately revoke permissions for those who leave or change roles. 2. Plan for data retention Any data generated by Motive s products must be retained, but how long should you keep it? Work with your legal department to align your policies with federal and state requirements. Regulatory agencies have specific retention requirements for data related to Hours of Service , DVIRs, maintenance and other records, and you ll need to stay compliant. However, think beyond regulations to include high-liability events, such as accidents, where data may be critical to investigations or litigation. nbsp 3. Protect against disablement Create monitoring systems to flag when dash cams and other devices are tampered with or disabled. Make consequences clear Intentional disablement puts your organization and others at risk and should trigger swift action. nbsp When safety or tracking devices are disabled, determine if the action was intentional or not. Disabling technology places a company at extreme risk, so make sure your policies include swift employee consequences to deter tampering in the future. nbsp Pro-tip Consider including disablement policies with safety or equipment policies already in place, putting it under a section on equipment misuse , for example. 4. Guard against falsification Manipulating safety data to conceal hours of service or other compliance issues is more than a regulatory breach. It s a liability waiting to happen. Establish clear processes to detect and deter falsification, and ensure accountability at all levels. Wherever possible, work with your legal team. 5. Respect employee privacy Monitoring employees with safety technology can raise privacy concerns. Understand which behaviors your solutions can track, which features are activated, and if you re in compliance with local laws. Work with legal counsel to ensure your policies balance monitoring needs with respect for employee rights. Dash cams A case study in policy excellence Dash cams are a critical component of the Motive safety suite, and they come with their own unique considerations. The goal is to create policies that unlock their full potential, support the process of coaching and behavioral change, and avoid misuse. Set clear access rules Define who can view video, or adjust program settings. For example, managers might need coaching access, but editing rights should be tightly controlled. Regularly review who has access and adjust as needed. Use video wisely Dash cam footage is a powerful tool for improving safety. Policies should outline Driver coaching Empower drivers to self-review and improve their behavior. Training Consider using anonymized videos as teaching tools for the broader team. Litigation Establish procedures for preserving and securing footage related to accidents. Encourage positive coaching Rather than relying on discipline, use video footage to coach drivers . The improvement that comes from video-based coaching is among dash cams greatest benefits. Policies should include guidelines for training managers, setting timelines for feedback, and escalating concerns when coaching doesn t work. Plan for video retention Dash cam footage can be critical for training, investigations, or legal defense. Decide how long to keep routine footage and high-risk event videos. Limit access to sensitive videos to prevent misuse. Handle requests thoughtfully When law enforcement, legal teams, or even employees request video footage, your policy should ensure consistency. Share only with legal counsel s approval to protect both drivers and your company.

            "Fleet accidents cost more than repairs. Discover the hidden expenses insurance hikes, downtime, and reputational damage and how prevention can protect your business.\n",
            "A look at the ripple effects of fleet safety failures and how prevention can save your business. Accidents in commercial transportation can be an enormous financial burden, regardless of whether you re managing delivery vans, utility trucks, or tractor-trailers. For medium to heavy trucks, an average crash costs a jaw-dropping 148,279 , and that s just scratching the surface. Beyond property damage and repairs, businesses face medical bills, legal fees, and insurance premium hikes not to mention downtime and hits to their reputation. Even more alarming is the rise of nuclear verdicts lawsuit settlements that soar into the millions, putting additional pressure on businesses. Given how essential these fleets are to daily commerce and infrastructure, the ripple effects of accidents extend far beyond individual companies, disrupting supply chains, delaying services, and impacting the broader economy. Read Anatomy of a crash nbsp from impact to action. The true cost of accidents 1. Medical and legal costs For service fleets such as cable or utility trucks the immediate cost of an accident can add up quickly. Repairs to the vehicle are only the tip of the iceberg. Medical bills for injured drivers or passengers often include emergency care, surgeries, and ongoing rehabilitation. And if a third party files a liability claim, companies can face hefty legal fees and settlement costs. Take the rise in nuclear verdicts, for example. In the trucking industry, cases with awards exceeding 1 million soared from just four in 2006 to over 70 in 2013 . In cases where service vehicle drivers are found liable for accidents, companies may face substantial financial penalties as well. nbsp One Florida cable provider learned this lesson the hard way after one of its vans collided with another vehicle, injuring passengers and damaging property. Preventive measures like dash cam-based driver training and vehicle safety checks could have mitigated much of that financial pain. Wabash under fire The 462 million verdict shaking the trucking industry. 2. Insurance premium increases Accidents don t just cost you upfront they also hit your bottom line in the form of higher insurance premiums. Transportation is already a high-risk industry, and even a single incident can cause insurers to reassess fleet safety practices. According to the American Transportation Research Institute ATRI , insurance premiums for trucking companies rose by 47 per mile between 2010 and 2020. For many businesses, the dramatic rise represents a significant and ongoing financial burden. 3. Operational disruptions and lost productivity When a vehicle in your fleet is involved in an accident, it doesn t just lead to physical damage it disrupts your entire operation. Accidents cause delays that ripple through your schedules, impacting freight deliveries, customer appointments, and supply chains. These disruptions often force companies to reroute shipments, hire temporary drivers, or pay overtime to keep things moving. For businesses that rely on just-in-time supply chain models, these delays can result in inventory shortages, halted production, and frustrated customers. 4. Reputational damage Accidents involving company vehicles don t just hurt your finances they can harm your reputation. One delivery company faced intense backlash after a 16.2 million jury award in a case where a child was struck by one of its vans. The incident highlighted lapses in driver safety training, drawing negative media attention and igniting outrage on social media. Public trust in the company plummeted, leading to long-term challenges in customer retention and brand perception. To rebuild trust, businesses often invest in safety measures like telematics , which monitor driver behavior and road conditions to reduce the risk of accidents. But recovering from reputational damage isn t easy, and the costs both financial and emotional can linger for years. 5. Employee morale and turnover Accidents can take a toll on your team s well-being. Witnessing or experiencing a traumatic crash can leave employees shaken, leading to stress, fear, and decreased productivity. Some may require counseling or time off, further straining your operations. Frequent accidents can also lead to higher turnover. Drivers may begin to question the company s commitment to safety and leave for better opportunities. Replacing them is costly, requiring additional recruitment, onboarding, and training. Prevention A smarter investment With so much at stake, the best way to manage the cost of accidents is to prevent them from happening in the first place. Forward-thinking companies are adopting advanced safety technologies, conducting regular safety audits, and prioritizing comprehensive driver training. These proactive measures protect employees, reduce operational risks, and preserve customer trust. The indirect costs of accidents lost productivity, reputational damage, and employee turnover can be up to 10 times higher than direct expenses. By investing in prevention, you re not just avoiding costs you re building a safer, more resilient business.

            "For safer outcomes, start building a healthier, happier fleet. Drivers are the lifeblood of every operation. They re not just moving goods from Point A to Point B they propel the U.S. economy and keep businesses running. Whether driving is a primary or secondary role for your employees, they all need support from time to time. Below are ways to prioritize driver well-being and build a stronger, more supportive culture for your team both on the road and in the field. Prioritize mental health and wellness Driving life can be tough. Long hours, isolation, and the pressure to meet deadlines can take a toll on mental health. Fleets can play a significant role in supporting drivers by offering mental health and wellness programs. Providing access to counseling services, stress management workshops, and mindfulness training can make a big difference. Mental health resources should be as accessible as possible, whether through an app or a dedicated hotline, to ensure that drivers have the help they need, when they need it. Recognize drivers with incentive programs Recognition and rewards go a long way in raising morale and encouraging safe driving. Implement programs that reward drivers for hard work, safe behavior, and growth. Monthly or quarterly acknowledgments, along with tangible and timely rewards, show drivers their hard work is valued. Celebrating their contributions reinforces their importance to the team and motivates continued excellence. Offer financial wellness programs Unpredictable income patterns and financial stress are common in the transportation industry. I often discuss the difference between old-school and new-school drivers, and finances are a top concern for both. Financial wellness programs that provide education on budgeting, saving, and planning for the future can help drivers feel more secure. Reducing financial stress doesn t just benefit drivers it leads to increased focus and productivity for the company as well. Promote healthy living Physical health is vital to a driver s performance and longevity in the field. Fleets can support healthy habits by partnering with gyms, offering discounts , or installing fitness equipment at terminals. Additionally, promoting access to nutritious food options at rest stops or through on-the-go meal partnerships can encourage healthier choices, boosting energy and overall well-being. Encourage open communication Transparent and frequent communication helps build trust. Regular check-ins, surveys, and town hall meetings give drivers a platform to voice their concerns and share feedback. Acting on their feedback improves morale as well as performance by addressing driver challenges from the field. Implement rider and pet policies The road can feel isolating, but supportive policies can help. Allowing drivers to bring a family member, friend, or pet along for the journey reduces loneliness and provides emotional support. Small adjustments go a long way in improving mental health and job satisfaction. Conclusion By investing in your drivers mental, physical, and financial well-being, you re investing in the long-term success of your fleet.

            "Two years ago, I began advocating for better driver health and fitness in the trucking industry. The reason? Truck drivers have a life expectancy of just 61 years , compared to the average U.S. life expectancy of 77.5 years . This startling gap highlights the urgent need for change. Jeremy Reymer of DriverReach recently launched Project 61 to increase awareness and drive action. Historically, driver health and wellness have been sidelined in favor of operational goals like improving fuel efficiency and streamlining delivery . Now companies are starting to see that healthy drivers mean safer roads, stronger fleet performance, and greater job satisfaction. With Motive s telematics and AI dash cams, fleets now have complete visibility into the driver s condition on the road and the ability to address wellness proactively. 5 great ways for drivers to stay healthy on the road. Why driver health and wellness matters Trucking is physically demanding and mentally taxing. Drivers face long hours, irregular sleep schedules, and little access to healthy food. These conditions can lead to Fatigue Reduced reaction times and higher accident risks. Stress Tight deadlines, traffic, and extended time away from home. Physical health issues Sedentary lifestyles and poor nutrition contribute to obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Mental health challenges Isolation and workplace pressures often lead to anxiety, depression, and burnout. Using data to support driver wellness Motive offers real-time insights that go beyond vehicle monitoring to identify health risks before they escalate. Here s how Motive approaches it. 1. Managing fatigue Driver fatigue poses a serious threat to fleet safety , contributing to nearly 100,000 accidents, 800 fatalities, and 50,000 injuries annually. Fatigue can lead to sudden lane merging, veering off the road, or crossing into oncoming traffic. These scenarios often result in disastrous outcomes that put lives in danger. nbsp Motive s Drowsiness AI manages fatigue much more proactively, detecting real-time signs of fatigue. Available with Motive dual-facing AI Dashcams , Drowsiness AI accurately detects early and late signs of drowsy driving, including Frequent yawning The dash cam alerts drivers who yawn repeatedly in a short period, advising them to pull over if they re struggling to stay awake. It also triggers an alert if the driver is distracted and starts yawning. Eyes closed If a driver begins to close their eyes and fall asleep, an in-cab alert aims to wake them before a serious collision. nbsp When drowsiness is detected, Motive alerts drivers and fleet managers immediately, enabling swift action to prevent potential accidents. To ensure safety, fleet managers can reroute trips, adjust schedules, or encourage drivers to take breaks. By combining Drowsiness AI with hours of service HOS tracking and unsafe driving detection, fleets can reduce fatigue-related accidents and keep drivers safe and alert on the road. 2. Reducing stress Unpredictable schedules and traffic conditions are major sources of stress. Motive s route optimization tools help drivers avoid congestion, reducing delays and frustration. Fleet managers can adjust routes in real time to keep drivers on schedule, ease workloads, and help drivers maintain a healthier work-life balance. 3. Encouraging movement and physical health Sitting for long periods takes a toll on a driver s physical health. While telematics can t get drivers out of the cab for a workout, it can provide data that encourages safer driving habits and highlight issues that may be taking place behind the scenes. If a lack of attention is a factor for drivers, encourage them to take regular breaks , get out of the cab to stretch, and get proper rest. Incorporating wellness practices into daily schedules has the potential to improve overall health , increase driver awareness , and even prevent accidents. 4. Rewarding healthy habits With real-time insights from the Motive Integrated Operations Platform , fleets can create personalized coaching programs for their drivers. By supporting individual driver performance, fleet managers can offer tailored recommendations to improve driver awareness along with safety. Use coaching sessions to help drivers improve and show that they re valued. Showing you care can improve morale and reduce turnover. nbsp New! Streamline coaching for safety and compliance with Motive Integrated Coaching. Incorporating incentives into fleet management programs, such as rewarding drivers who maintain safe driving habits or participate in health and fitness programs, can create a culture of wellness that extends across the fleet. The Motive Safety Score makes it easy to track performance and reward safe behavior, helping fleets build a healthier, more engaged workforce. Building a coaching culture Modern fleet management is shifting from punishment to coaching. Instead of penalizing drivers for unsafe behavior, fleets use dash cam clips and telematics data to provide constructive feedback. For example, the Motive AI Dashcam helps managers review with drivers video clips of their most dangerous habits, such as close following, hard braking, or speeding. Every coaching session empowers drivers to improve and gives managers an opportunity to build trust with the team. Why wellness benefits business It may come as a surprise, but investing in driver wellness is a smart business move. Healthier drivers are safer, more productive, and less likely to quit. With a healthier driver workforce recruitment, training, and insurance costs can all be lower. With Motive, fleet managers can address wellness proactively, improving driver well-being and other outcomes. Take the next step Driver wellness spurs fleet success. Motive makes it easier to promote health, cut down on risk, and build a strong safety culture. Improve fleet safety and driver wellness with Motive s comprehensive solutions.

            "Build a culture of driving safety with Motive. Recognize and reward positive driving behaviors to engage and inspire safer fleets.\n",
            "Building a culture of safety that drivers fully embrace isn t easy. While coaching unsafe behaviors is key to preventing accidents, focusing only on the negatives makes it hard to build trust with your drivers. Every day, your drivers make smart, proactive decisions to keep themselves and others safe. These actions often go unnoticed but they don t have to. Introducing Positive Driving Motive now automatically identifies positive driving behaviors like safe distancing and alert driving, making it easier to recognize and reward your drivers for the smart decisions they make on the road. Safe distancing A driver slows down quickly and creates a safe following distance after being cut off by another vehicle. Alert driving A driver shows exceptional awareness by quickly reacting to unexpected obstacles, such as swerving vehicles, road debris, animals, or pedestrians. Or they yield promptly to fast-approaching emergency vehicles. The way Motive detects positive driving behavior is unique in the industry. The Motive Safety Team reviews every safety event and potential collision within seconds, with two key objectives 1 remove false positives and 2 identify positive driving. With other systems, safety managers have to spend time manually reviewing videos and tagging them for positive driving behaviors. With Motive, this happens automatically and in-real time, saving you countless hours and ensuring that no positive driving behavior is missed. With positive driving events automatically identified by Motive, safety managers can start coaching sessions with positive reinforcement. This helps build driver trust in the system and makes drivers more willing to accept and apply feedback. As Dina Eidinger, Corporate Fleet Specialist at Prudential Overall Supply , explains When drivers only hear about what they re doing wrong, they stop listening. Motive automatically identifies positive driving behaviors, making it easy to recognize good work and help drivers become more accepting of dash cams. Positive Driving is currently in beta and will be available to all customers soon. Real-world recognition Positive driving in action Recognizing positive behavior creates a supportive environment where drivers feel appreciated and open to feedback. Here are examples that deserve recognition Safe distancing A passenger vehicle merged into the lane, cutting off our vehicle. The driver quickly created a safe following distance, avoiding a collision. wistia-player media-id j12kfy5uov not defined background center contain no-repeat url https fast.wistia.com embed medias j12kfy5uov swatch display block filter blur 5px padding-top 56.25 Alert driving A passenger vehicle attempted to cut in front of our vehicle to make a highway exit.

Thanks to his quick thinking, he slowed down just in time, and we recognized him for his defensive driving. Motivating drivers and building safer fleets. Recognizing positive driving isn t just about celebrating a job well done it s about reinforcing habits that make your fleet safer and your drivers more engaged. Businesses with highly engaged employees have 64 fewer safety incidents, 43 less turnover, and 81 fewer absences than those with low levels of worker enthusiasm. With Motive, you can build a program that inspires drivers to perform their best every day.

            "When a vehicle s onboard diagnostics system detects a malfunction, it generates a Diagnostic Trouble Code DTC and typically alerts the driver through a warning light or message on the instrument panel. DTCs play a critical role in vehicle maintenance by identifying issues that need attention, supporting fleet safety, and preventing further damage. Modern fleet management systems like the one from Motive can transmit DTCs in real time to fleet managers and technicians, allowing for proactive maintenance decisions. With the support of advanced technologies, smarter fleet operations are within reach. Get the full scoop on DTC codes and their meanings What are DTC codes? DTCs, short for Diagnostic Trouble Codes, are alphanumeric codes generated by a vehicle s onboard diagnostics OBD system. These codes are standardized under the OBD-II protocol for vehicles manufactured since 1996 or the J1939 protocol for heavy-duty vehicles. They help pinpoint specific issues with a vehicle s systems. Understanding the structure and meaning of each DTC is the first step in using them effectively. Each DTC consists of five characters First character Indicates the system for example, P for Powertrain, C for Chassis, B for Body, U for Network . Second character Specifies whether the code is generic 0 or manufacturer-specific 1 . Third character Indicates the subsystem for example, fuel, air metering, ignition . Fourth and fifth characters Provide a specific fault description. For example, the code P0301 indicates a misfire in cylinder one Powertrain system . Modern advancements in DTC monitoring In the past, identifying and interpreting DTCs required physical access to the vehicle and manual scanning tools. Today, advancements in telematics and fleet management software have transformed this process. Real-time diagnostics, such as Motive s, provide automatic transmission of fault codes to fleet management dashboards, supporting immediate action. Benefits of real-time DTC monitoring Improved Uptime Identifying issues early helps avoid costly breakdowns and extends vehicle lifespan. Streamlined Maintenance Fault codes can be prioritized and addressed promptly, avoiding delays. Enhanced Driver Safety Immediate alerts help prevent critical issues from escalating. Data-Driven Decisions Historical fault code data can reveal patterns, aiding predictive maintenance. Types of DTC codes DTCs are broadly categorized into 1. Critical codes Severe issues requiring immediate attention to prevent significant damage are classified as critical codes. Examples include high engine temperatures or low oil pressure. Real-time diagnostics help fleet managers act quickly, such as redirecting vehicles to the nearest service center. 2. Non-critical codes Emissions-related issues or minor faults that don t require immediate action fall under non-critical codes. Attention is still needed to maintain compliance and avoid long-term damage. Interpreting DTCs The first character letter OBD-II codes start with a letter that denotes the part of the vehicle that has a fault. P Powertrain. Includes engine, transmission, and associated accessories. C Chassis. Covers mechanical systems and functions steering, suspension, and braking. B Body. Parts that are mainly found in the passenger compartment area. U Network amp vehicle integration. Functions that are managed by the onboard computer system. The second character number The first letter is followed by a number, usually 0 or 1. 0 Standardized SAE code, also known as generic code sometimes called global 1 Manufacturer-specific code sometimes called enhanced The third character number For powertrain codes, this number tells you which vehicle subsystem has a fault. There are eight 0 Fuel and air metering and auxiliary emission controls 1 Fuel and air metering 2 Fuel and air metering injector circuit 3 Ignition systems or misfires 4 Auxiliary emission controls 5 Vehicle speed control, idle control systems, and auxiliary inputs 6 Computer and output circuit 7 Transmission You may also see an A, B, or C, which can refer to hybrid propulsion systems. For other families of codes, refer to the definitions provided by your manufacturer. The fourth and fifth characters number The final piece of a DTC is a number that defines the exact problem that you re experiencing. It can be a number between zero and 99. Here s an example of a complete code P0782 means powertrain, generic, transmission, 2-3 shift malfunction. The best source for DTC meanings is the dealer that sold or leased the truck to you or the manufacturer who made it. Some DTCs are specific to the vehicle. Download the complete list to your device so that you can access it any time, including in areas where cellular service may be spotty. Or consider implementing a vehicle diagnostics software solution that provides definitions for you. Key DTC examples and their meanings Common DTCs encountered by fleets include P0101 Mass Air Flow MAF Sensor Fault P0442 Small Leak in Evaporative Emission System P0706 Transmission Range Sensor Malfunction P0500 Vehicle Speed Sensor Malfunction For comprehensive troubleshooting, fleet management systems like Motive provide detailed fault code descriptions and recommended actions. How to read DTC fault codes You need a diagnostic connector to read DTCs. Most scan tools provide codes in one-line descriptions, and some will include the DTC meanings. Basic code readers or scanners typically only give you the five-character code. To get the definition, you ll need to check a standard DTC list or database and your manufacturer s website and reference material for your vehicle s specific model. Using a robust fleet management solution will give you complete code definitions automatically provided with your fault alerts. Plug the scanner into your vehicle s 16-pin OBD-II diagnostic connector, commonly located on the steering column s left side and under the dashboard. However, since connectors aren t universal, vehicle diagnostic connectors manufactured before 1996 will require specific adapters. The latest vehicle models generally have the same connectors, but variations in the software and hardware depend on the vehicle s make, model, and year. To read DTC fault codes using a scan tool, follow these general steps. Find the location of the 16-pin in the vehicle. Some connectors are in the center console, and other vehicles might have them hidden behind a knee bolster panel or other types of panels. Consult the manufacturer s vehicle manual to find the OBD-II diagnostic connector if it s not in any of these locations. Plug in your code reader or scanner and turn on the ignition or keep the engine running depending on your vehicle s OBD requirement . This allows the scan tool to communicate with your vehicle s ECU. From the tool s menu, select the option for read codes. You might need to enter specific information such as the vehicle model and year if your scanner isn t set to get this data automatically. The scan tool will then show any present DTC faults, and usually, in numerical order. In some tools, these will include the code definitions. Most of the latest scanners allow you to transfer the codes to a smartphone or computer via Wi-Fi, USB code if available , and Bluetooth. While DTC codes provide valuable information about potential vehicle problems, these are meant to act as guides to find underlying issues and further diagnose the root of the defective and malfunctioning vehicle components. Also, clearing codes won t make the vehicle issues disappear. This can even be dangerous and lead to vehicle failure and expensive liabilities that can cost you thousands of dollars down the line. Besides an OBD-II or DTC scanner, reliable telematics systems and devices provide more efficient ways to read and monitor engine diagnostics. Telematics systems can track your vehicle s engine and systems in real-time, alerting you to any problems as they arise promptly. Robust telematics systems can easily detect DTC codes and automatically transmit the information to your fleet managers, staff, and drivers, allowing quick action and response. This improves your preventive maintenance process, reducing your unplanned repair costs.

            "Stay compliant with Canada s 2025 hours-of-service rules. Learn driving limits, duty cycles, ELD requirements, exemptions, tips for simplifying HOS compliance in this comprehensive guide.\n",
            "Canada s trucking industry operates under some of the most comprehensive regulations in the world, with an emphasis on safety, efficiency, and sustainability. At the heart of these regulations are Canada s ELD Mandates , which are designed to combat driver fatigue, reduce accidents, and maintain smooth operations for the industry. For any commercial driver operating within Canada, a clear understanding of the Canada HOS rules is essential to ensure compliance and avoid penalties. This guide dives into the most critical aspects of hours of service Canada rules, including the requirements, exemptions, and tips for compliance in 2025. What are Canada hours-of-service rules? The Canada Hours of Service regulations are federal rules that govern the maximum number of hours a commercial motor vehicle CMV driver can operate within a given timeframe. These regulations also mandate specific rest periods to ensure drivers remain alert and safe while on the road. Studies show that driver fatigue contributes to approximately 20 of fatal collisions in Canada, costing the country billions annually in health care and lost productivity. By enforcing HOS rules, Transport Canada aims to minimize these risks while improving road safety and protecting the livelihoods of commercial drivers. Canada HOS and the ELD mandate Since January 1, 2023, the Canada electronic logging device ELD mandate has been in full effect. These devices replace traditional paper logs and manual recording systems, ensuring more accurate tracking of driving hours and simplifying compliance with Canada HOS rules. Certified ELDs offer several advantages Automation Reduces errors and saves time for drivers and carriers. Real-Time Monitoring Allows fleet managers to track driver status and identify potential violations. Environmental Benefits Eliminates the need for paper logs. Carriers and drivers must use certified ELDs that meet the technical standards set by the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators CCMTA . Who must comply with Canada hours-of-service rules? The Canada HOS regulations apply to most commercial drivers operating within Canada, including those crossing international borders. However, certain vehicles and operations are exempt, including Primary Produce Transport Vehicles with two or three axles delivering goods like farm produce, fish, or forest products, provided the driver is the producer. Emergency Vehicles Used for police, fire, and ambulance services. Public Welfare Emergencies Vehicles providing relief during disasters or emergencies as defined under the Emergencies Act. Despite these exemptions, most carriers and drivers must adhere strictly to the regulations to avoid fines and ensure road safety. Key hours-of-service Canada rules 1. Daily Driving Limits Drivers cannot drive for more than 13 hours within a single day. At least 8 consecutive hours of off-duty time must be taken before driving again. 2. On-Duty Limitations Drivers are limited to 14 hours of total on-duty time including driving and non-driving activities in a single day. After 14 hours, they must log off-duty time before resuming work. 3. Off-Duty Requirements A minimum of 10 off-duty hours must be logged within each 24-hour period. This includes 8 consecutive hours plus at least 2 additional hours, which can be split into increments of 30 minutes or more. 4. Duty Cycles Cycle 1 Drivers may not exceed 70 hours on duty in any 7-day period. Cycle 2 Drivers may not exceed 120 hours on duty in any 14-day period. Drivers must take at least 24 consecutive hours off-duty before accumulating 70 hours under this cycle. 5. Split Sleeper Berth Rules Drivers may split their mandatory rest periods into two sleeper berth periods, provided neither is less than 2 hours and both total at least 10 hours. Special provisions for northern Canada north of Latitude 60 N The Canada HOS rules include unique provisions for drivers operating in northern territories, such as Yukon, Nunavut, and the Northwest Territories, where conditions are harsher, and distances are greater Driving Limit Increased to 15 hours per shift. On-Duty Limit Extended to 18 hours per shift. Shift Limit Drivers may work up to 20 hours , provided they take 8 consecutive hours off-duty afterward. These adjustments recognize the challenges of driving in remote regions and ensure operational flexibility without compromising safety. Canadian hours-of-service exemptions Deferral of Off-Duty Time Drivers may defer up to 2 hours of their required off-duty time to the following day under specific conditions No more than 13 hours of driving or 14 hours of on-duty time are logged on Day 1. Deferred time is added to the mandatory off-duty hours on Day 2. Emergency Conditions Drivers may exceed the maximum driving and on-duty limits during emergencies, such as severe weather or natural disasters, provided it is safe to do so. The role of paper logs and ELDs Although the Canada ELD mandate has largely replaced paper logs, drivers must still maintain paper logs as backups in case of ELD malfunctions. These logs must include Date and start time of the duty cycle. Duty status changes, including location and duration. Total driving and on-duty hours for the day. Why compliance with Canada HOS rules matters Non-compliance with Canada HOS rules can lead to Fines and Penalties Both drivers and carriers face steep fines for violations. Out-of-Service Orders Drivers exceeding HOS limits may be declared out of service. Increased Accident Risk Fatigued drivers are more likely to cause accidents, jeopardizing lives and cargo. Tips for simplifying HOS compliance Use Certified ELDs Ensure all devices meet Transport Canada s certification standards. Train Drivers Regularly Keep your team informed about rule changes and compliance best practices. Automate Compliance Tracking Use fleet management software like Motive to monitor HOS, identify violations, and maintain accurate records.

            "It wasn t so long ago that the only way to track assets was with the help of a pen and paper. Over time it s become clear that manual asset tracking causes more problems than it solves. Especially in this era of automation. Problems like time wasted and inefficient record storage set companies behind their peers who embrace technology. Though many businesses have shifted to recording tracking details in spreadsheets, it still calls for manual data entry. And that leaves room for error. Most industry standards have evolved to the point where automation is necessary. By using cloud-based asset tracking to keep accurate records, companies can benefit from accurate, real-time data. Automated tracking systems use barcode labels and GPS tags to trace the location of each asset. It eliminates the need for manual data entry and ensures the accuracy of asset records. See how we built the AG Mini wistia-player media-id x5jh9l0eye not defined background center contain no-repeat url https fast.wistia.com embed medias x5jh9l0eye swatch display block filter blur 5px padding-top 56.25 Let s take a look at what asset tracking is in the fleet management industry , how it works, and some of the benefits for fleet managers. What is asset tracking? Asset tracking is the method of tracking physical assets. You can track assets by scanning labels attached to assets, or by using GPS or RFID tags that broadcast location. Assets are defined as anything valuable that an entity owns, benefits from, or uses in the process of generating income. Assets are often confused with inventory. They re not the same. Inventory refers specifically to items that are intended for sale or distribution. In fleet management , asset tracking allows fleet managers to monitor the location, status, and maintenance schedules of their equipment and trailers. How does asset tracking work? Asset tracking allows companies to access information about each individual asset. The information includes an asset s location, the individual in possession of it, when it will reach its destination, and which maintenance or certifications are out of date. Managing and tracking assets has been a pain point for companies of all sizes. Being able to access information about assets digitally allows companies to be more efficient and profitable. It also extends the lifespan of the asset and maximizes its usage. Asset tracking allows companies to identify underutilized assets, perform regular maintenance to prevent costly repairs, and sell assets that are no longer valuable. It also allows companies to know where their assets are at all times. That eliminates time spent looking for assets and prevents theft and misuse. Understanding GPS tracking To identify the location of a piece of equipment, use GPS tracking for assets. GPS tracking for assets allows companies to locate equipment in the event it has been reported lost or stolen. It also allows companies to ensure that each asset is located exactly where it s supposed to be. In the past, companies relied on manual methods of asset tracking, such as hand counting, paper logs, and spreadsheets. The result was hours of wasted time trying to locate assets. And money lost from under-utilized assets. Manual methods also meant that assets that were lost or stolen might never be found. There was no way to trace them. In today s world, cargo and asset theft is rampant. Trucking and retail lose 15 to 30 billion from cargo theft every year. The benefits of asset tracking Asset tracking enhances every aspect of equipment management. It gives you the opportunity to lower your costs, optimize asset utilization, and reduce time spent on administrative duties. It also improves overall fleet efficiency and increases productivity. Asset tracking relies on telematics . Telematics is the process of transmitting information remotely over long distances. By transferring data remotely, telematics helps companies with all the items below. Greater visibility in operations management Geofencing to deter theft and unauthorized use Simplifying business workflows Reducing costs Managing a large number of assets is complex and can be difficult for companies. Especially when it comes to managing assets consistently over a long period of time. Having a complete asset management system in place benefits companies. It allows them to save money, make their work life easier, deter theft, and prevent equipment malfunctions. Learn more about the benefits of asset tracking. How is asset tracking used? Tracking trailer fleets with GPS helps streamline operational functions, including dispatch and workflow and asset tracking. That means you can run your business more efficiently and profitably. To realize the full value of tracking trailer fleets with GPS , you ll need best-in-class hardware and software. Motive uses an Asset Gateway device that s attached to the equipment.

            "Discover top tips for diesel engine maintenance! Learn how to extend engine life, improve fuel efficiency, and prevent costly breakdowns.\n",
            "Diesel engines revolutionized transportation when they were first introduced in the late 19th century. Over a century later, they remain the backbone of the commercial trucking industry. Their unmatched efficiency and durability make them a critical component of modern fleets. However, consistent diesel truck maintenance is crucial to ensuring these engines perform reliably and efficiently over their long lifespan. How does a diesel engine work? Understanding how to maintain a diesel engine starts with knowing how it works. Rudolf Diesel s groundbreaking design in 1893 laid the foundation for modern diesel engines. By 1925, Alfred Büchi s turbocharging advancements elevated diesel engines efficiency, and Robert Bosch s innovations in fuel injection in 1927 further enhanced their performance. A diesel engine operates on a four-step internal combustion cycle Air Intake The piston moves down to draw air into the cylinder. Compression The piston moves up, compressing the air, which increases its temperature. Diesel fuel is injected just before the piston reaches the top. Power Stroke The heat ignites the fuel, forcing the piston downward. Exhaust The piston pushes out exhaust gases as it moves back up. This process eliminates the need for spark plugs, unlike gasoline engines. With a higher compression ratio, diesel engines deliver superior efficiency and torque, making them ideal for heavy-duty trucks. Why diesel engine maintenance matters Diesel truck maintenance is important for extending engine life, improving fuel efficiency, and ensuring safe performance. Neglecting routine maintenance can lead to costly downtime, reduced engine performance, and potential safety hazards. A well-maintained diesel engine can last between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 miles up to 30 years before needing significant repairs. By contrast, gasoline engines typically last only about 200,000 miles. This longevity is due to diesel engines robust design, heavy-duty components, and the efficiency of diesel fuel. Key benefits of proper diesel truck maintenance Reduced Downtime Regular maintenance minimizes the risk of unexpected breakdowns. Lower Costs Addressing small issues early prevents expensive repairs later. Better Fuel Efficiency Clean filters, quality fuel, and optimal engine operation reduce fuel consumption. Better Safety Performance A well-maintained engine reduces the risk of accidents caused by mechanical failure. Common diesel engine problems and how to prevent them Overheating Diesel engines run hotter than gasoline engines. Regularly check and maintain the cooling system, and replace coolant before it becomes acidic. Clogged Filters Dirty diesel filters can choke the engine, leading to reduced power and efficiency. Replace filters regularly to prevent this. Water Contamination Moisture in the fuel system can damage the engine. Empty the water separator as needed and keep water out of the fuel tank. Low Lubrication Use high-quality oil and additives to ensure proper engine lubrication, especially for new diesel engines that generate significant heat and residue. Diesel maintenance tips for fleet managers Fleet managers play a vital role in keeping diesel trucks in peak condition as part of their fleet s maintenance operations . Here are best practices for maintaining diesel engines Stick to a Maintenance Schedule Regular oil changes, filter replacements, and inspections are non-negotiable. Monitor Fuel Quality Use premium diesel fuel to reduce buildup and enhance engine performance. Inspect Components Check alternators, radiators, and fuel injectors for wear and tear. Prepare for Winter Use winterization additives to prevent fuel clogs and protect the engine in colder climates. Listen for Warning Signs Unusual sounds, black exhaust, or decreased performance often indicate underlying issues. Diesel engine maintenance checklist Use this checklist to keep your diesel trucks in top shape Change oil and filters on schedule. Inspect and clean fuel injectors. Check the alternator, radiator, and condenser for wear or damage. Maintain the cooling system to prevent overheating. Monitor for fuel contamination or oil oxidation. Empty the water separator regularly. Use high-quality oil and fuel additives when needed.

            "Explore the likely effects of Trump s presidency on commercial transportation, from deregulation to fossil fuel support and pro-business policies.\n",
            "With Donald Trump securing the presidency in the 2024 U.S. election, change is on the horizon. As the new administration takes hold, commercial transportation businesses should expect spending cuts, more deregulation, and a business-minded approach. nbsp In the run-up to the election, President-elect Trump emphasized support for fossil fuels, limiting federal regulation, and using traditional energy sources over green energy. Now he s ready to deliver. With Republican majorities in the Senate and the House, the legislative landscape is sure to align with the new administration s pro-business priorities. Here s what commercial fleets can expect under the next Trump administration. nbsp Also by David O Neal A look at ATRI s Top 10 issues and what they mean for you. 1. Executive branch What the regulatory outlook has in store Through the executive branch, the Trump administration will promote economic growth by scaling back regulatory restrictions. With the Department of Transportation DOT and Department of Labor DOL shifting under more conservative leadership, expect important changes like those below. Environmental regulations and energy policy The prediction Trump s approach to energy favors traditional fossil fuels produced in the United States. The emphasis on rapid green energy adoption, which is typically more dependent on other parts of the globe, will be scaled back. nbsp The impact Under the Trump administration, expect the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to roll back emissions standards for commercial fleets, making it easier to continue using diesel without shouldering the costs associated with newer technologies. nbsp For companies using older vehicles, the new approach could have a positive impact on companies bottom lines. To meet federal or state standards, businesses won t have to invest so much in vehicles that run on alternative fuels . However, rolling back emissions standards could slow the transition to cleaner energy, potentially putting U.S. transportation companies at a disadvantage in global markets focused on sustainability. Labor and safety regulations The prediction Under Trump, don t be surprised if the Department of Labor rolls back worker protections or loosens regulations that affect the transportation industry . Policies that require mandatory breaks, or that reclassify independent contractors as employees, have become quite contentious for last-mile delivery services and trucking companies. The new administration plans to move away from these requirements. The impact Moving forward, there will be little appetite for stricter labor laws that regulate driver classification, wages, and benefits. As a result, companies will be able to continue using independent contractors, potentially saving on labor costs. Meanwhile, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA could adopt a more business-friendly stance, scaling back oversight on safety inspections and compliance checks so companies can manage safety protocols internally . Infrastructure investment The prediction Trump has long advocated for more investment in infrastructure. However, his approach leans heavily on public-private partnerships PPPs instead of massive federal spending. Because PPPs are focused on return on investment, they re less likely to build in more remote, rural areas. The impact Metropolitan areas and routes with heavy traffic may see greater investment under Trump as a result nbsp including investment in 5G technology. 2. Legislative Branch Republican-controlled Senate and potential House influence With Republicans holding the Senate and the House, policies will align closely with the president s pro-business platform. Here s how the most notable policies could be affected. Infrastructure bills The prediction The Republican-led Senate and House will support infrastructure spending, but not at the levels of previous administrations. Bills with significant public-private partnerships or provisions for reduced environmental oversight on construction projects are likely to pass. The impact With House Republicans backing Trump s infrastructure agenda, it will likely lead to moderate investment in highways, ports, and freight corridors. With the massive Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed under Biden now coming up for renewal under the Trump administration, expect a concerted effort to roll back federal spending and have it become more targeted. Climate and energy legislation The prediction With Republicans in control, the push for aggressive climate-focused legislation will likely stall. The impact Clean energy initiatives and mandates for commercial transportation companies to transition to low-emission vehicles will be more measured or delayed, allowing companies to minimize investment in green energy without penalty. While a move like this might cut operational costs temporarily, it would leave U.S. fleets lagging behind their international counterparts as global markets move toward greener logistics standards. Technology and autonomous vehicles The prediction Republicans generally favor innovation with few regulatory constraints. With that in mind, Congress may support autonomous vehicle testing and development, potentially creating favorable conditions for commercial fleets interested in automation . The impact With minimal restrictions, AV companies may see faster progress in deploying semi-autonomous technologies within the trucking sector. However, without additional safety and workforce regulations, widespread adoption will take time as companies balance innovation with practical deployment needs. 3. Judicial Branch Shaping long-term industry norms Considering the conservative judicial appointments made during the previous Trump administration, and the potential for additional appointments in his upcoming administration, the Supreme Court and lower federal courts will probably take a conservative stance in interpreting cases relevant to the transportation industry. nbsp Here s a look at how key issues might be affected by a conservative judiciary Labor classification and worker rights The prediction Under the new administration, legal challenges surrounding gig economy workers should persist, as states push for clearer guidelines on independent contractor classification. The impact Given the current conservative judicial lean, the Supreme Court may favor rulings that maintain flexible contractor status, giving transportation companies more freedom to operate within gig-style models. This would be beneficial for companies like last-mile delivery services and ride-share firms, although worker advocates may continue to push for reform at the state level. Environmental regulation challenges The prediction The conservative judiciary could influence rulings on federal and state environmental regulations affecting commercial transportation. If states attempt to enforce stricter emissions standards, court challenges could arise, potentially limiting state authority to impose standards that exceed federal statutes. nbsp The impact Successful challenges would generate a consistent regulatory environment across the country. However, they might prevent more environmentally conscious states from enacting progressive measures for commercial vehicles. Data privacy and technological compliance The prediction The judiciary will also play a role in interpreting data privacy laws, especially as connected vehicles become more common in the industry. With conservative judicial leanings, rulings may favor corporate control over operational data, giving companies more freedom to use driver and vehicle data for route optimization and efficiency without strict compliance requirements. The impact Moves like this could raise privacy concerns, spurring additional state legislation to protect drivers data rights. Expect to see a continued focus on cybersecurity measures to protect business data and minimize the influence of fraud and exploitation. Nuclear verdicts and tort reform The prediction A GOP-controlled Congress and a judiciary with a conservative mindset including the Supreme Court could significantly impact nuclear verdicts and the broader landscape of tort reform in commercial transportation. Historically, Republicans and conservative judges tend to advocate for policies and rulings that limit the scope of civil liability and promote economic stability for businesses. A GOP-led Congress might push for federal legislation to cap punitive damages in civil cases standardize liability rules or enhance preemption of state laws that allow for large jury awards. The impact All of this could reduce the prevalence of nuclear verdicts, particularly in industries like trucking, which are highly vulnerable to litigation. Conservative federal and Supreme Court judges often favor interpretations of the law that restrict judicial activism and prioritize strict adherence to statutory language. This adherence can discourage more expansive interpretations that often lead to inflated awards. The judiciary could also uphold tort reform measures as constitutionally valid, countering potential challenges from trial lawyers or states. Overall, the combination of a more conservative judiciary and GOP control of the White House and Congress may create a legal environment more favorable to businesses. If so, it would reduce litigation risks and make the outcome of liability cases easier to predict. However, critics might argue that the ability of plaintiffs to receive fair judgments will be compromised, and business incentives to prioritize safety may be reduced. 4. The impact of the Chevron decision When the Supreme Court recently made this landmark ruling , they limited the authority of federal agencies to interpret ambiguous statutes on their own, without clear Congressional authorization. Here s how the ruling s impacts might be felt going forward. Reduced regulatory uncertainty The prediction The Chevron decision means that federal agencies like the Department of Transportation DOT and Environmental Protection Agency EPA will have less freedom to interpret ambiguous rules. The impact Limiting interpretation could cut back the regulatory uncertainty that has challenged companies, as agencies will need clearer Congressional mandates before imposing major new requirements. As a result, we could see more predictable, and more stable, regulatory conditions, allowing companies to plan with greater confidence. A potential slowdown in environmental and safety mandates The prediction Agencies will face greater limitations in setting aggressive emissions standards or safety requirements without explicit direction from Congress. nbsp The impact Agencies like the EPA may find it more challenging to impose stringent emissions standards, or to mandate certain technologies for specific engine types, benefiting companies that rely on traditional fuel sources. However, this could also slow the transition to greener technologies, potentially impacting competitiveness over time. A shift in influence to state-level regulations The prediction With federal agencies constrained in their regulatory power, states may take on a more significant role in setting environmental and safety standards. nbsp The impact More state involvement could lead to a patchwork of regulations across the country, especially in states with stricter policies that might impose their own emissions or labor standards, such as California. For companies operating across state lines, the differences could complicate compliance and increase operational costs. Conclusion The 2024 election results are set to usher in a period of deregulation and pro-business policies in the commercial transportation industry. Under the Trump administration, we can expect a rollback of environmental and labor regulations, moderate infrastructure improvements, and a more lenient stance on worker classification that benefits companies that rely on independent contractors. Although some state-level reforms may attempt to counter these federal moves, the overall industry landscape will favor flexibility, lower costs, and conservative growth over rapid transformation. As a result, transportation companies will be able to focus on expansion and profitability, even as they navigate the complexities of a slower transition to green and automated technologies.

Preventive maintenance helps avoid these costs by catching potential problems early, allowing for cheaper, simpler fixes before major damage occurs. Reduced downtime and increased vehicle availability For fleets, time is money, and vehicle downtime directly affects profitability. By addressing mechanical issues proactively, preventive maintenance reduces the likelihood of unexpected breakdowns, keeping vehicles on the road and available for service. Scheduling maintenance during off-peak hours ensures that vehicles are ready when needed, improving overall fleet availability and minimizing disruption. Improved safety and compliance Driver safety is paramount in fleet management, and mechanical failures can lead to accidents, injuries, and legal issues. Preventive maintenance ensures that vehicles are always in optimal working condition, reducing the risk of failures that could compromise driver safety. By maintaining up-to-date vehicle inspections and servicing records, fleets can stay compliant with regulatory requirements, avoiding penalties, fines, and exposure to highway accidents. Optimized maintenance scheduling Preventive maintenance enables fleet managers to optimize maintenance schedules , ensuring that service tasks are performed only when necessary rather than sticking to rigid intervals. This flexibility prevents unnecessary maintenance, saving both time and resources while ensuring that critical repairs aren t missed. Preventive maintenance allows fleet managers to manage maintenance tasks based on real-world conditions, such as mileage, engine hours, or driving behavior.

            "Learn how to improve cost savings with effective fleet cost management strategies. Explore tips for reducing expenses and boosting efficiency in this comprehensive guide.\n",
            "Managing fleet costs constantly challenges businesses, especially in light of rising fuel prices, maintenance demands, and compliance requirements. For the most effective fleet cost management, identify areas of inefficiency and implement strategies to cut expenses. This guide explores the key components of fleet cost management, along with ways to optimize spending, so your business can improve profitability and stay competitive. Understanding fleet cost management Fleet cost management means analyzing and controlling any expenses associated with operating a fleet. Fleet costs typically fall into three categories Fuel costs Fuel costs are a major expense for any fleet, impacted by fuel prices, driving habits, and route efficiency. Maintenance and repairs Preventive maintenance and timely repairs are critical for avoiding breakdowns and costly downtime. Operational expenses Costs that fall under fleet operations include driver wages, insurance premiums, compliance fees, and administrative overhead. By taking a strategic approach, businesses can significantly reduce costs and improve overall efficiency. Key strategies for fleet cost management Monitor fuel usage and optimize routes Fuel is often the largest expense for fleet operators, making it a top target for cost management . To reduce fuel consumption Use telematics to track fuel efficiency and identify inefficiencies in driving behavior, such as idling or harsh acceleration. Optimize routes with GPS fleet tracking technology to avoid traffic, reduce mileage, and minimize unnecessary detours. Consider fuel cards to gain better control of spending and access discounts at participating stations. Implement preventive maintenance programs Staying ahead of maintenance needs is critical for cost savings. Regular inspections and servicing help Reduce the likelihood of breakdowns and emergency repairs. Extend vehicle lifespan, saving on replacement costs. Minimize downtime by addressing minor issues before they escalate. Digital tools can simplify maintenance scheduling and provide reminders to keep vehicles in peak condition. Leverage technology for real-time insights Advanced fleet management solutions offer real-time data about vehicle performance, driver behavior, and fuel usage. With these insights, fleet managers can Identify cost-saving opportunities across the fleet. Monitor driver habits and provide targeted coaching to improve efficiency. Track expenses and generate detailed reports to inform decision-making. Control insurance and compliance costs Insurance premiums can add up quickly, but there are ways to manage these expenses effectively Implement safety programs to reduce accidents and demonstrate low-risk operations to insurers. Use dash cams and telematics to provide evidence in case of claims, minimizing liability costs. Stay compliant with regulations to avoid fines and penalties that can strain budgets. Reduce vehicle downtime Downtime is costly both in terms of vehicle repair costs and lost productivity. To minimize downtime Maintain a robust maintenance schedule. Use data analytics to predict potential issues before they occur. Invest in reliable equipment that meets the demands of your operations. Optimize asset utilization Underutilized vehicles drain resources without contributing to productivity. To maximize asset efficiency Track usage patterns and reallocate vehicles to where they re needed most. Consider selling or leasing underused vehicles to free up capital. Use fleet management software to monitor asset utilization and adjust your strategy accordingly. Embrace sustainable practices Adopting sustainable practices can lead to long-term cost savings while improving your environmental footprint. Strategies include Transitioning to fuel-efficient or electric vehicles. Encouraging eco-friendly driving habits among drivers. Partnering with suppliers or vendors that align with sustainability goals.

            "Discover the 7 essential ways to prevent forklift accidents in the construction industry. Learn tips to reduce risks and improve workplace safety.\n",
            "Forklifts are indispensable in the construction industry, providing the muscle to move heavy loads and streamline operations. However, they also pose a significant safety risk. Forklift accidents are among the most common workplace incidents on construction sites, often leading to severe injuries, costly downtime, and regulatory penalties. According to the National Safety Council, as many as 25,000 workers miss work or can t perform their usual tasks due to forklift accidents each year. Understanding the causes of forklift accidents and implementing proactive safety measures is critical for creating a safer, more efficient work environment. In this guide, we ll explore the most common types of forklift accidents and share seven actionable tips to avoid them. Learn about the future of construction fleet management. Common types of forklift accidents Tip-overs Forklifts tipping over are among the most dangerous accidents, often caused by overloading, uneven terrain, or sharp turns. Collisions Forklifts frequently collide with other vehicles, equipment, or structures due to poor visibility or inadequate operator training. Pedestrian incidents Pedestrians and workers struck by forklifts are a leading cause of workplace injuries, often occurring in crowded or poorly marked areas. Falling loads Improperly secured loads can shift or fall, endangering operators and nearby workers. Mechanical failures Poorly maintained forklifts can experience brake failures, steering issues, or other mechanical malfunctions. 7 ways to prevent forklift accidents 1. Invest in operator training and certification Proper training is the foundation of forklift safety. Make sure that all operators are certified and trained on the specific forklifts they ll use. Training should cover Safe driving practices Load-handling techniques Emergency procedures Refresher courses should be conducted regularly to keep skills sharp and update operators on new safety protocols. 2. Conduct daily inspections A quick daily inspection can prevent mechanical failures that lead to accidents. Operators should check Brakes and steering Tires and forks for damage Lights, horns, and alarms Fluid levels and battery charge Using a digital inspection checklist can streamline this process and make certain nothing is overlooked. 3. Implement clear traffic management plans Separate forklift traffic from pedestrian areas wherever possible. Use barriers, signage, and floor markings to designate safe zones and prevent collisions. Create clear traffic flow patterns and enforce speed limits to minimize risks. 4. Avoid overloading Overloading is a leading cause of forklift tip-overs. Verify that operators know the load capacity of their forklift and never exceed it. Use load backrests to secure items and distribute weight evenly to maintain balance. 5. Maintain forklifts regularly Preventive maintenance is crucial for keeping forklifts in top condition. Schedule regular inspections and servicing to address wear and tear before it becomes a hazard. A comprehensive maintenance program should include Checking hydraulic systems Inspecting tires for wear and adequate pressure Replacing worn-out parts promptly 6. Improve visibility Poor visibility contributes to many forklift accidents. Equip forklifts with safety features like mirrors, dash cameras , and backup alarms. Verify that operators have a clear line of sight and adequate lighting, especially in low-visibility areas or at night. 7. Promote a culture of safety Safety starts with leadership. Foster a workplace culture that prioritizes safety by Encouraging employees to report hazards Conducting regular safety audits Rewarding safe behavior Implementing technology solutions, like Motive s fleet safety tools can help monitor and promote safer practices in real time. Why forklift safety matters Forklift accidents can lead to serious injuries, expensive fines, and reputational damage. By investing in prevention strategies, construction companies can reduce the risk of incidents , protect their workforce, and improve l productivity.

            "View the biggest economic and supply chain trends across the Motive platform and see which factors are moving the U.S. economy in the Q1 2025 report.\n",
            "Welcome to the Q1 edition of the Motive Monthly Economic Report! As we kick off 2025, we are shifting our reporting cadence from monthly to quarterly updates. This shift will provide a more comprehensive view of the key economic factors impacting the supply chain and logistics landscape, allowing us to track larger trends and better predict future market movements. By tracking the volume of goods moving into distribution centers and crossing borders, Motive has a clear view of the flow of inventory before it reaches stores. Our unique insights into what s happening between consumer spending and the movement of goods serve as a leading indicator of consumer demand, retail inventory changes, and other market trends before they fully materialize. Keep reading for a front-seat view into key factors currently influencing the U.S. economy. Motive Predictions Retailers are poised for moderate gains in Q1 as a healthy economy fuels consumer spending across sectors. Import rates will continue to rise in Q1, despite continued concerns around the impact of tariffs. Long-term tariff impacts on cross-border activity are expected to be moderate much of the current tariff speculation is overblown. We expect a nearly 30 spike in new carrier registrations in January as the trucking market continues its positive trajectory. Top Findings Retailers saw strong performance in Q4 and the holiday season, indicating a healthy economy and strong consumer spending. Consumers are increasingly shopping in person. Trade with Mexico hit new records imports through the Laredo port increased 30 year-over-year. nbsp While Mexico trade continues to rise, truck crossings into the U.S. from Canada dip Anticipated tariffs and East Coast labor strikes have driven surges in south-border trade. Q4 carrier exits are down a whopping 69 year-over-year. Q4 showed strong retail performance, and we expect growth to continue in Q1 Motive s Big Box Retail Index was up 3.8 year-over-year in the peak week leading up to Christmas, with department stores, apparel, and electronics increasing 41.8 compared to 2023. This strong performance indicates high demand for inventory in the final weeks before the holiday. Changes to retailers restocking patterns, particularly when bringing inventory into stores, also contributed to this year-over-year spike. In 2024 we saw peak movement occur a week later than in 2023, and when we compare the peaks of 2023 and 2024, we saw a 32 increase in 2024. The overall positive performance of the Big Box Retail Index is a sign of a healthy economy and consistent consumer spending. The home improvement sector also had a strong close to the year, increasing 47.7 in Q4 compared to Q4 2023. Grocery and superstores saw moderate growth, increasing 12.8 compared to last year. The sales-to-inventory ratio remained flat at 1.29 in November, but inventory levels are expected to rise in 2025. Historically low inventory-to-sales ratios over the past year resulted from lean supply chains, overcapacity, and high interest rates, which discouraged overstocking. As supply chain costs rise and interest rates decline, retailers may adopt more defensive inventory strategies to manage market uncertainty. Strong Q1 sales are anticipated across department stores, home improvement, electronics, and grocery sectors. Lower interest rates will support this growth, but higher inventory levels could expose retailers to risks from global disruptions, such as tariffs, strikes, or sourcing challenges, potentially requiring strategy adjustments going into Q2 and beyond. The increase in brick-and-mortar sales, reflected in the 41.8 increase across department stores with large brick-and-mortar sales, indicates consumers are increasingly returning to in-person shopping. We anticipate continued growth in physical retail stores through Q1, with department stores and grocery chains seeing the most gains. Trade with Mexico remains strong, and Q1 should see continued growth, regardless of new tariff policies 2024 was a record year for goods crossing the southern border, with October marking the highest number of truck crossings on record at 677,000, surpassing May 2024 records of 675,000 truck crossings. November s numbers followed seasonal patterns, showing a decline compared to October. Laredo, which handles about 40 of imports by road, saw a significant 28.5 year-over-year increase in Christmas imports, reflecting robust freight movement from Mexico, the U.S. s largest import partner. Nearshoring manufacturing capacity in Mexico, fueled by significant foreign investment, is set to further drive positive import growth. On the West Coast, ports like the Port of Los Angeles experienced very strong performance. In November, the port saw a 22 increase in volumes, following a 34 rise in September. These surges were likely driven by demand for non-North American goods ahead of anticipated new tariffs and in anticipation of potential labor strikes on the East Coast. Notably, imports from China in November rose 6.7 year-over-year, reflecting a push to secure inventory before potential tariffs. However, compared to 2021, when imports from China peaked, import rates are down by 21.7 , highlighting a significant shift in trade volumes. This underscores the impact of evolving supply chain strategies, trade policies, and efforts to increase regional manufacturing and sourcing. While Mexico trade was on the rise at the end of last year, truck crossings from Canada showed a contrasting trend, dipping almost 5 year-over-year in November 2024 and remaining relatively flat compared to prior years. Unlike Mexico, where trade by truck has seen significant growth, Canada has not experienced the same momentum as a trading partner. Comparing September-October 2024 to the same period in 2018 shortly after tariffs took effect , truck crossings from Mexico increased by 19.3 , whereas Canada saw a decline of 4.7 . This highlights the differing dynamics between the two key trading partners and underscores the stronger trade momentum Mexico continues to maintain. We anticipate a rise in trade activity in January, driven by strong demand and the delivery of previously ordered parts and equipment. While near-term volatility is expected particularly for imports from outside North America, including intermittent surges in low-cost goods from China Mexico and Canada will likely remain strong trade partners due to consistent demand, higher-value goods, and policy pressures favoring regional sourcing. Drawing from historical trends like the 2018 tariff rollout, we expect a phased approach to potential policy changes, with consultation periods extending into mid-year. Companies increasingly diversified supply chains should help mitigate disruptions, and we remain optimistic about a positive Q1, buoyed by preemptive inventory adjustments and ongoing supply chain concerns. Trucking market moving toward a strong 2025 and potential boom cycle nbsp In Q4, 3,789 carriers exited the market, a dramatic 69 decrease compared to Q4 2023, which saw 12,000 carriers exit. These exit levels signal a significantly more stable market than a year ago and a steady positive trajectory, especially considering the seasonal spike of carrier exits we typically see in December and January. Looking back at the year overall, we saw 19,000 carriers exit the market in 2024, compared to 40,000 in 2023, a significant decrease of 50.8 year-over-year. We expect January 2025 exit rates to be very similar to December 2024, with Q1 staying largely flat before ramping up later in the year. New carrier registrations increased 2.8 year-over-year in Q4, with 21,352 carriers registering. November and December 2023 saw the lowest numbers of new carriers entering the market compared to other months of the year, reflecting typical seasonal trends. However, January typically sees a 28.6 jump in registrants from December, and we expect January 2025 to follow this pattern, with Q1 overall experiencing a significant spike in new registrations. This growth would position 2025 to start with approximately 8,500 registered carriers, representing an increase of 7.1 compared to January 2024. We anticipate rising freight rates, lower interest rates, and sustained demand for cross-border trade to continue driving the trucking market s positive momentum throughout Q1. In Q4, strong retail performance fueled increased demand for freight services, a trend expected to persist into 2025. Increased demand is likely to spur the formation of new small businesses, further fueling growth in the market and creating more jobs. Freight volumes are projected to rise significantly in the first half of 2025, supported by stabilizing interest rates and increasing trade with Mexico. Additionally, sector-specific growth may benefit from policy changes, particularly in industrial sectors such as oil and gas, creating further opportunities for the trucking sector across consumer and commercial markets. Summary The Q1 2025 economic outlook is positive, with strong retail performance, rising trade with Mexico, and growth in the trucking market. Stabilizing interest rates, robust consumer demand, and higher inventory levels are expected to drive retail and freight activity. The trucking market is poised for significant growth in Q1, with new carrier registrations expected to jump nearly 30 in January. Declining carrier exits and policy-driven opportunities, particularly in industrial sectors like oil and gas, are creating a more stable and optimistic outlook for the sector with a potential boom cycle in the future. nbsp Data Methodology The Motive Quarterly nbsp Economic Report uses aggregated and anonymized insights from the Motive network and publicly available government data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, U.S. Census, and U.S. Department of Transportation.\n",

These systems use cameras, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging LiDAR to monitor a vehicle s surroundings in real time. LiDAR is a remote sensing technology that uses laser pulses to measure distances and create detailed 3D maps of environments. Some advanced collision avoidance systems go a step further by taking automated actions, such as applying brakes or steering adjustments, to avoid a collision if the driver fails to respond in time. How collision avoidance systems work Collision avoidance systems rely on a combination of hardware and software to detect and respond to potential threats , including Sensors and cameras Cameras, radar, and LiDAR continuously monitor the vehicle s environment, including other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles. These devices detect objects in the vehicle s path and measure distances, speeds, and trajectories. Real-time processing The system s onboard computer processes data from the sensors and cameras in real time. Using AI and machine learning, the system identifies potential hazards and determines whether a collision is likely. Driver alerts If a potential collision is detected, the system alerts the driver through visual, auditory, or haptic signals. This gives the driver a chance to take corrective action. Automated responses Advanced systems can take automated actions, such as emergency braking, throttle control, or steering adjustments, to prevent or minimize the impact of a collision. Types of collision avoidance systems Collision avoidance systems come in various forms, each addressing specific types of risks Forward collision warning FCW Alerts drivers of a potential collision with a vehicle or object ahead. Automatic emergency braking AEB Automatically applies the brakes when a collision is imminent. Lane departure warning LDW Alerts drivers if the vehicle unintentionally drifts out of its lane. Blind spot detection BSD Monitors blind spots and alerts drivers of nearby vehicles. Pedestrian detection Identifies pedestrians in the vehicle s path and provides alerts or automated braking. Rear collision warning Detects obstacles while reversing and provides alerts or automated braking. Benefits of collision avoidance systems Investing in collision avoidance systems offers a range of benefits for fleets Enhanced driver safety Helps prevent accidents by providing timely alerts and automated interventions. Reduces the risk of injury to drivers, passengers, and other road users. Lower insurance costs Many insurers offer discounts for vehicles equipped with advanced safety systems.

            "How Physical AI is powering real-world results for fleets. It s official We ve entered the era of Physical AI. At CES, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang declared that AI has evolved beyond perception images, words, and sounds and generative creating text, images, sound into a new wave AI that can perceive, reason, plan, and act in the real world. In other words, AI is stepping out of cyberspace and into the physical world transforming industries from manufacturing and agriculture to logistics and transportation. I recently discussed this in my Forbes column . Specifically, I talk about how much of the focus has been on language models like ChatGPT and Gemini, which are automating workflows and helping people produce much faster. AI s impact is far-reaching. It extends well beyond these areas. In fact, with the help of AI, countless industries are seeing game-changing returns, especially in the realm of computer vision, where technology is filling critical gaps in human perception and execution. At Motive, we ve been championing this movement since the arrival of our AI Dashcam in 2021. Now that the tech world has caught up to this concept, let s discuss what Physical AI is, why it matters for fleets, and how our customers are using it to reduce enterprise risk, increase safety, automate processes, and enable employees to do higher-value work. What Is Physical AI? Physical AI combines artificial intelligence with sensors, cameras, and other data-gathering tools to enable machines and software to perceive, understand, and act in the real world. Unlike AI that exists purely online, analyzing text or images, Physical AI directly interacts with the environment Perception Sensors and computer vision gather real-time data about surroundings, whether that s a warehouse floor, a construction site, or city streets. Understanding Algorithms interpret this sensor data to detect patterns, identify anomalies like potential accidents or suspicious transactions , and predict outcomes. Action Advanced models then autonomously trigger a response like alerting a driver, adjusting a route, or flagging a suspicious expense before it becomes a bigger problem. When you apply that to fleets, you get self-learning systems that reduce accidents, manage complex logistics, and boost operational efficiency. Why Physical AI Matters for Fleets In industries reliant on vehicles, equipment, and frontline workers, such as transportation and logistics, construction, energy oil and gas, field service, and more, improvements in speed or safety translate directly to cost savings and competitive advantages. Here s why Physical AI is a must-have in fleet management Enhanced Safety Fleet safety isn t just about defensive driving it s about proactive risk mitigation. AI-powered dashcams can detect collisions and unsafe behaviors in real time, alerting drivers or fleet managers before incidents escalate. By reducing accidents, companies avoid injuries, protect their bottom line, and gain valuable data to refine future training programs. Streamlined Operations Physical AI automates many routine tasks like tracking maintenance schedules or even auto-approving low-risk purchases. That frees up team members to focus on higher-value work, like analyzing fleet performance, upskilling or reskilling, or negotiating better rates with suppliers. Optimized Costs When your AI system flags suspicious transactions or predicts which vehicles might break down, you trim wasteful spending and unexpected maintenance costs. Accuracy in AI particularly in computer vision is critical here. The better the model, the fewer false positives, and the more direct savings. Strategic Decision-Making Physical AI goes beyond spotting obvious risks. It can analyze patterns across the entire fleet including driver behavior, route efficiency, and vehicle health to identify untapped opportunities. That kind of end-to-end visibility helps CFOs, operations leaders, and fleet and safety managers make data-driven decisions that push the business forward. Computer Vision In Transportation Life-Saving AI Today, computer vision is being underutilized. We re hoping this new focus will change that. Motive s 2023 State of Safety report found less than a quarter of respondents said they use AI-powered cameras. Roadways remain deadly, with nearly 43,000 fatalities in 2022 . But the promise is real. Businesses have a massive opportunity to utilize computer vision AI to improve the safety, productivity, and profitability of their business. Motive has been building advanced computer vision AI to revolutionize commercial vehicle safety. These AI systems monitor driver behavior and road conditions in real-time, alerting drivers to potential hazards before they become accidents. Some customers reported they have cut at-fault accidents by up to 91 , saving as much as 6.5 million on insurance costs, legal fees, medical bills, settlements, and other accident-related expenses while achieving 2,000 ROI. Adding Action to the Equation How Motive s AI Acts in Real Time A natural question many people have when they hear Physical AI is whether Motive s AI Dashcams and real-time alerts truly count as acting in the physical world. Isn t acting reserved for fully autonomous systems that take over vehicle controls? Not exactly. nbsp Motive s AI capabilities actively contribute to safer and more efficient fleet operations by perceiving, reasoning, and acting in real time. Here s how the process works. Perceive Our camera and sensor systems already detect objects, driver behaviors, and events in real time. Reason Motive s AI interprets these perceptions to identify unsafe driving, such as drowsiness, rolling through a stop sign, or following too closely. Plan amp Act While we don t physically steer the vehicle as in advanced autonomous driving , our AI issues alerts and reminders to drivers in real time helping them correct course before incidents escalate or a collision occurs. We also store and analyze data for post-trip coaching, which changes long-term driving behaviors and acts on risk at the organizational level. From an automotive perspective, acting might strictly mean taking control of the steering wheel or pedals. But from an AI perspective, issuing real-time alerts that shape driver behavior or flagging potential hazards to managers is very much an action that influences the physical world. nbsp We see it as a collaborative model the AI perceives, reasons, and alerts the human driver or manager takes the final step to prevent a potential accident or issue . Over time, consistent coaching and feedback loops allow fleets to act more safely and efficiently, without ever needing to hand full control over to the AI but instead, riding shot-gun as a co-pilot or assistant to the driver. This distinction matters, because Physical AI isn t limited to autonomous robots or self-driving cars. It includes any system like Motive s AI Dashcam or AI Omnicam that translates real-time perception into an action that meaningfully impacts real-world operations. By taking these small but critical steps to keep drivers safe on the road, Motive is already delivering Physical AI for fleets today. Physical AI Is Taking Off And Motive is Leading the Way The physical economy encompasses the industries that transport goods, power our homes, cultivate our food, and maintain the infrastructure that keeps society running. This includes sectors such as transportation and logistics, construction, energy, field service, and more. nbsp Just as generative AI tools have transformed consumer-focused applications, they also can substantially reshape how we develop AI-driven products for the physical economy. And that s exactly what we re seeing now. Industry heavyweights are pouring resources into Physical AI. From NVIDIA s Cosmos World Foundation Model , aimed at accelerating this technology, to Google s new team dedicated to simulating the physical world , the excitement is palpable. Press outlets are starting to coin the phrase Physical AI to describe next-generation automation and machines that think and act in real-world settings. But here s the truth we ve been here all along, and we re leading the way with constant, iterative improvement. At Motive, our AI-powered dash cams, asset trackers, and data analytics have already been delivering Physical AI across logistics, trucking, and other high-touch industries for years. nbsp Learn more about computer vision a key component of the technology driving this wave of innovation and expansion in our 2025 Computer Vision Guide .

Explain why dash cams are needed The first question drivers inevitably ask is, Why do we need dash cams? The answer is simple to improve fleet safety . AI dash cams act as an extra set of eyes on the road, alerting to unsafe driving behaviors such as Drowsy driving Distracted driving Forward collision warnings Close following Unsafe lane changes nbsp At the same time, AI dash cams encourage safer driving habits. The goal isn t to micromanage, but to support drivers in their daily work. And the impacts add up fast. After implementing dash cams, Motive survey respondents said they experienced many benefits, including Better visibility into driver performance 57 . Fewer unsafe driving behaviors 54 . Higher insurance savings 45 . Fewer accidents 43 . These aren t just statistics they re real-world proof that AI dash cams help make roads safer, protect drivers, and shield businesses from liability. Here s what drivers say about the Motive AI Dashcam wistia-player media-id 5cm5gngwky not defined background center contain no-repeat url https fast.wistia.com embed medias 5cm5gngwky swatch display block filter blur 5px padding-top 56.25 2. Build trust through transparency Drivers need to understand how AI dash cams work. Motive dash cam video is automatically uploaded to the server for manager review only when high-risk driving behaviors are detected. Even then, follow-up actions should focus on improvement, not punishment. When introducing AI dash cams, keep these best practices in mind Communicate openly . Explain what dash cams do and how they help drivers. Listen to concerns . Address fears about monitoring with clear facts and empathy. Keep it simple . Avoid technical jargon and make explanations easy to understand. Building trust starts with making drivers feel heard and supported, not scrutinized. 3. Use real-world stories to gain support For commercial fleets, the threat of nuclear verdicts is a growing concern. At a time when large settlements can put companies out of business, AI dash cams can serve as an objective eyewitness, protecting drivers from false claims and fleets from high-stakes payouts. When I worked for a telecom company, I saw firsthand the impact dash cams have in quashing false claims. Here are two ways dash cams made a difference Exonerating a driver at a stop sign . One of our drivers faced a situation at a stop sign where the driver in front reversed right into him, falsely claiming they had been rear-ended. Video footage from the Motive AI Dashcam told the real story, exonerating our driver and preventing legal and financial fallout. nbsp Avoiding wrongful liability . In another instance, one of our drivers was accused of swerving into another lane. Footage showed that the other vehicle was at fault, eliminating any liability for our business. See how the AI Dashcam helps drivers in real time. wistia-player media-id 00jlfihj6m not defined background center contain no-repeat url https fast.wistia.com embed medias 00jlfihj6m swatch display block filter blur 5px padding-top 56.25 4. Roll out dash cams to driver champions first A phased rollout can help build trust and ease the transition to AI dash cams. Instead of introducing dash cams to the entire fleet at once, start with a select group of drivers who can champion the technology. These early adopters can help influence their peers and create a smoother adoption process. Here s how to make it work 1. Choose the Right Drivers. Select drivers who are respected by their peers and have a strong safety record. Well-respected drivers can help shift perceptions and reinforce the idea that dash cams are tools for protection, not punishment. 2. Involve Champions in the Process . Make driver champions part of the conversation from the start. Provide hands-on training, answer their questions, and encourage them to share their honest feedback. If they see the value in dash cams, they ll be more likely to advocate for them. 3. Gather and Share Positive Experiences . Once your champions have used dash cams, ask them to share their experiences with the rest of the team. Whether it s a close call that was prevented or a false claim that was disproven, real stories from fellow drivers carry more weight than a company policy or presentation. 5. Prioritize coaching over discipline When rolling out AI dash cams, take a coaching-first approach . Initially, we made the mistake of going right to discipline instead of coaching. It caused a lot of distrust. Shifting to a coaching model helped drivers see dash cams as tools for improvement. Here s what worked Recognizing safe driving habits . By highlighting clips of safe driving in the break room or in safety meetings, you ll build drivers confidence in dash cams. Prepare clips that highlight great driving or that show how dash cams were used to help drivers improve. Some AI dash cams, like the Motive AI Dashcam , identify positive driving behaviors automatically, making it easy to reward drivers for responsible driving behavior such as safe distancing and alert driving. As a result, safety managers can use the Motive AI Dashcam to recognize and retain drivers, not to punish them. Tracking Motive Safety Scores to celebrate progress and reward drivers . The Motive Safety Score shows at a glance when a driver s safety score improves. Managers can track Safety Scores by the day, week, or month. When driving performance improves, be sure to give drivers credit for it and reward them for a job well done. Creating a structured coaching process . Clear guidelines for improvement helped drivers feel supported rather than penalized. Focusing on progress rather than punishment builds a culture of safety and continuous improvement. 6. Engage the team and make safety a shared priority A successful rollout requires getting everyone involved. Here s my advice for a smooth dash cam rollout, based on personal experience. 1. Address Concerns at Every Level We engaged drivers, managers, and leadership in discussions to explain the why behind AI dash cams. Various management team members were assigned to share the message and encourage open dialogue. Drivers felt heard and involved in the process, which helped ease concerns. 2. Reinforce Safety as a Core Value Many fleets already prioritize safety. We aligned AI dash cam implementation with our company s existing safety culture. We started Be Your Brother s Keeper a company initiative reminding drivers they could stop any unsafe action and coach their peers privately. This strategy became the Good Catches program, where team members highlighted safety improvements across the organization. 3. Set Clear Goals and Track Progress We defined key objectives and used Motive Safety Scores to track the following Any reduction in unsafe behaviors Positive driving trends Incidents avoided A carrot over stick approach worked best. Drivers responded well when we Set performance targets Measured progress Celebrated improvements Made the team part of the solution 4. Build a Culture of Continuous Improvement A well-structured program drives long-term success. To sustain engagement, we focused on Encouraging self-improvement Clear and consistent communication Ongoing process refinements based on driver feedback Deeper Dive Learn how to tailor Motive Safety Scores to your needs. From resistance to results A smarter rollout The right strategy leads to stronger engagement, commitment to safety, and continuous improvement. Clear communication, well-defined goals, and an inclusive process make all the difference. By listening to concerns, building trust, and focusing on coaching and recognition, you can see incredible results with AI dash cams. Congratulations on taking this important step toward a safer and more efficient operation. nbsp Take the first step toward driver buy-in today.\n",

All-in-one platforms like the Motive Integrated Operations Platform address these challenges so that transportation businesses can operate better. Here s a detailed look at how these platforms improve visibility, production, and results. nbsp Watch the webinar Bridging the Gap Connecting drivers, fleet managers, and data to drive productivity. Challenges facing fleet operators Fleet managers often struggle with incomplete, outdated, or inaccessible information. Such roadblocks can lead to inefficiency, delays, and reputational damage. Gaps in communication and a lack of visibility have a tendency to disrupt operations. One common issue involves tracking heavy equipment . Equipment managers face delays when assets such as bulldozers or trailers are misplaced or need to be retrieved from job sites. nbsp It can take hours, days, or weeks to physically move and track down equipment. Yard hunts can take forever and create huge administrative burdens. The lack of communication about where equipment was left and where it needs to go can have a huge impact on operations and hinder productive use of the equipment. Robert Higdon , Director of Product at Motive To run their operations, commercial fleets depend on multiple systems. But because many systems aren t integrated, they re unable to communicate with each other, opening the door to problems like these Inefficiency Teams waste hours managing systems that aren t connected to one another, resulting in slower production and higher costs. Data overload With too much data coming from disparate systems, managers have a hard time deciding which information they can trust, slowing down production. More expense Untracked fuel use, missed maintenance, and high insurance premiums cut into profitability. Broken communication Miscommunication about equipment location can disrupt workflows, delay projects, and slow production sometimes for weeks or months. nbsp The Motive solution The Motive Integrated Operations Platform tackles pain points head-on by centralizing data, automating workflows, and streamlining communication.

            "Motive s innovative tools help fleets tackle the American Transportation Research Institute s top industry challenges, boosting safety, efficiency, and cost savings.\n",
            "Every year, the American Transportation Research Institute ATRI releases its Top Industry Issues report , a trusted resource for identifying concerns shaping the transportation industry. Reviewing these findings allows fleet leaders to better understand emerging trends, address key issues, and strategically position their operations for success. For businesses looking to address ATRI s top industry issues, Motive offers innovative solutions. Motive products are uniquely designed to improve driver safety and cut costs. Here s how Motive can help your business overcome ATRI s top industry challenges quickly and effectively. Driver compensation Driver compensation is a big challenge in the transportation industry. For businesses and drivers alike, time is money. Delays and excessive detention time at customer facilities are costly for everyone. Fortunately, the Motive ELD provides fleets with real-time GPS tracking and a utilization report that accurately identifies dwell time. This level of accuracy allows fleets to quantify detention time and wasted labor, then leverage the data to negotiate stronger contracts with shippers. Motive s geofencing capabilities let fleets monitor recurring customer locations, making it easier to track dwell time patterns and proactively address driver wait times. Fleets can leverage Motive s data to advocate for higher detention pay for drivers, minimize wait times, and improve retention by ensuring drivers are compensated for their time. nbsp Motive s real-time GPS data allows fleets to designate the smartest routes for drivers, so delays and downtime can be avoided. With Motive s fuel management solution and vehicle diagnostics, fleets can cut operational expenses and reinvest those savings into higher wages and bonuses for drivers. Truck parking and efficiency The scarcity of truck parking is another pain point for the industry. While Motive doesn t create parking, Motive s GPS tracking and route optimization tools help drivers plan better trips, enabling them to reach designated parking areas before their Hours of Service run out. CSA scores CSA scores are vital to fleet operations, influencing everything from business partnerships to insurance premiums. Motive DVIRs and dual-facing dash cams give fleets an edge in improving their CSA scores. By alerting drivers to maintenance issues as they arise, and keeping fleets in compliance, businesses can reduce violations, pass roadside inspections, and prevent crashes. As a result, they can bring their CSA scores down. Delays at customer facilities Detention time at customer facilities slows drivers, leading to frustration and potential safety risks. Especially as detained workers feel pressured to drive faster and push the limit on hours-of-service restrictions. Motive s location data allows fleets to track precisely how long drivers are waiting on a customer. The data can be used to negotiate detention pay with shippers, so that drivers are compensated for their time and detention-related losses are kept to a minimum. Lawsuit reform While lawsuit abuse reform is mainly legislative, Motive s dual-facing AI Dashcams and AI-powered safety features offer accurate protection against frivolous lawsuits. Dash cam video footage can serve as valuable evidence in exonerating drivers and fleets from wrongful blame in crashes and disputes. Having an indisputable record of unsafe incidents, like the one AI dash cams provide, gives fleets more power to defend themselves against lawsuits and nuclear verdicts. Motive technology indirectly contributes to lower insurance premiums and better relationships with insurers by preventing costly legal battles and reducing litigation exposure. Fuel management and economy Given the industry s economic pressures, lowering operational costs is a priority for many fleets. Fuel is a top expense, making efficiency crucial. Motive s fuel management tools track consumption, idling, and wasteful driving behaviors, such as harsh acceleration and excessive idling. Data-driven insights help fleets reduce waste by optimizing routes, encouraging efficient driving habits, and identifying maintenance issues that impact fuel economy. By cutting unnecessary fuel costs, fleets can reinvest savings into driver pay, retention programs, and maintenance, improving profitability and operational efficiency. Motive enables businesses to maximize every gallon, reducing expense while keeping drivers and operations running. Distracted driving Distracted driving is a common cause of accidents. However, the Motive AI Dashcam proactively alerts to signs of distraction in real time, deterring unsafe habits like cell phone use and distracted driving. Motive s real-time alerts prompt drivers to correct distracted driving as it happens, reducing the risk of a crash. Motive gives businesses the tools they need to address many of ATRI s top industry issues. Whether reducing claims or improving safety, Motive s AI-powered technologies can improve every aspect of fleet management . The issues we face as an industry are serious issues. However, solutions are available. With the right technology, fleets can proactively improve safety, efficiency, and profitability. Motive s solutions empower fleets to optimize driver pay, improve CSA scores, and protect against legal risks. Now is the time to future-proof your fleet. Get started with Motive today .\n",

            "FMCSA is overhauling its CSA program to simplify safety scoring and reduce penalties. Learn about the key changes in our latest blog.\n",
            "The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA is making major changes to its Compliance, Safety, Accountability CSA program . These updates aim to simplify how fleet safety is measured while addressing long-standing concerns about fairness and scoring accuracy. This blog covers the key changes and what fleets need to know to adapt. Key changes to the Safety Measurement System Streamlined safety categories FMCSA is restructuring the seven Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories BASICs into what will be known as Compliance Categories . Notable adjustments include Controlled Substances and Alcohol will merge into Unsafe Driving Vehicle Maintenance is splitting into Vehicle Maintenance and Vehicle Maintenance Driver Observed The key distinction is that Driver Observed violations cover issues a driver can identify during pre- and post-trip inspections, while the broader Vehicle Maintenance category includes issues typically found during scheduled maintenance. The complete guide to roadside inspections Grouped violations to prevent overlapping penalties The current CSA system includes 959 violations, often leading to multiple citations for similar issues in a single inspection. FMCSA is reducing this number to 114 violation categories, so that multiple infractions from the same category count as one violation in CSA scoring. For example, if a driver is cited for both an 11-hour and a 14-hour violation under Hours of Service HOS rules , it will now count as a single violation rather than two separate infractions. This change could significantly help fleets avoid excessive penalties from a single inspection. Simplified severity weighting Instead of a one-to-10 severity scale, FMCSA is moving to a two-tiered system Severity Level 1 for standard violations Severity Level 2 for out-of-service or disqualifying violations This adjustment reduces subjectivity and provides more consistency in scoring. More stable CSA percentile rankings One of the biggest frustrations for fleets has been dramatic shifts in CSA percentile scores when moving between peer groups. Under the proposed system, FMCSA will use a weighted average approach , softening the impact of an individual fleet s position within its peer group. Previously, fleets could see their score jump by 20 percentile points or more after a single inspection, even without any performance changes. With this update, FMCSA s analysis shows no fleet will experience percentile swings of more than 10 points in any category . Faster score improvements for violation-free fleets Currently, the only way to improve CSA scores is through violation-free inspections or waiting for violations to age out over the course of 24 months. FMCSA is proposing a 12-month reset rule Fleets with no violations in specific categories over 12 months will no longer receive a CSA score in that category, including HOS Compliance Vehicle Maintenance Driver Observed Maintenance Hazardous Materials Driver Fitness This change allows fleets to see score improvements sooner , rather than waiting two years for violations to drop off their record. Higher mileage caps for Utilization Factor Fleets with higher mileage often see a greater exposure to violations and crashes. FMCSA is adjusting its Utilization Factor , which gives high-mileage carriers credit in CSA scoring. The cap is increasing from 200,000 to 250,000 miles per power unit , offering additional relief to high-utilization fleets. Crash Preventability Determination Program expands eligibility FMCSA is also expanding the Crash Preventability Determination Program CPDP , which allows fleets to challenge preventability rulings on crashes. As of December 1, 2024, fleets can now submit more types of crash scenarios for review. New eligible crash types Four additional crash types now qualify for review Side-impact collisions from a vehicle traveling in the same direction previously limited to rear-side strikes . Crashes caused by vehicles entering from driveways or parking lots. Collisions resulting from another motorist losing control of their vehicle. Any crash with video evidence clearly showing the CMV was not at fault. The addition of a video-based review category is especially important. Now, fleets can submit dash cam , security camera, or third-party footage as proof that a crash was not preventable. This update underscores FMCSA s growing recognition of the power of dash cams to improve fleet safety . What s next? FMCSA hasn t yet announced a firm implementation date for these reforms, but industry experts expect a 2025 rollout . These updates reflect a push for fairer scoring, reduced penalties for minor infractions, and a more accurate picture of fleet safety performance. For fleets, these changes mean fewer unfair penalties, more stability in CSA scores, and faster improvements for good performance. While some details are still being finalized, fleets should start preparing now by reviewing their CSA data and ensuring accurate recordkeeping. Simplify compliance and lower risk with Motive Managing CSA scores and staying compliant is easier with real-time visibility into hours of service and safety performance.

            "The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA is exploring how artificial intelligence AI can help process Police Accident Reports PARs faster and more efficiently. In December 2024, FMCSA released a report detailing its research into AI-driven tools that could speed up the review of crash reports and improve accuracy. This effort is part of the agency s Crash Preventability Demonstration Program, which allows trucking companies and drivers to challenge certain types of crashes they believe were unavoidable. The challenge of reviewing accident reports Under the current system, trucking companies, drivers, and industry partners can submit crash review requests through FMCSA s DataQs system . If a crash is determined to be unavoidable, it no longer negatively affects a carrier s safety record. However, this process depends heavily on reviewing accident reports, which can vary widely in format, terminology, and detail depending on the state or jurisdiction where they were issued. Eye on AI Top fleet management trends for 2025. Since the program launched, nearly 70,000 crash review requests have been submitted, and recent expansions have increased the number of eligible crash types. As a result, processing times have slowed, meaning that non-preventable crashes continue to impact the safety scores of some fleets for longer than necessary. Reviewing these reports takes significant time and effort, delaying the process and making it harder to keep up with demand. How AI can improve the process To address these challenges, FMCSA partnered with the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute nbsp VTTI to study how AI could help speed up the review of accident reports. Researchers evaluated whether AI-powered tools could automate parts of the review process, reducing the time needed to analyze crash details and determine preventability. What the study found Initial results are promising. The results showed that AI could cut the time analysts spend on reviews by about 50 . With further refinements, that number could reach 65 to 70 . By using machine learning to quickly analyze large amounts of data, AI can help identify patterns and make preliminary assessments. This means faster results, more consistency, and less chance for human error. What this means for trucking companies Faster accident report processing means trucking companies could see non-preventable crashes removed from their records more quickly, improving their Compliance, Safety, and Accountability CSA scores. Lower CSA scores can lead to fewer inspections and lower insurance costs, which directly impacts a company s bottom line. Beyond crash reviews, AI could also assist with other regulatory processes. One potential application is analyzing public comments on new regulations, which could help make the rulemaking process more efficient. AI could also be used to speed up the publication of crash data, which currently takes years to finalize. The future of AI in fleet safety As FMCSA continues to refine these AI tools, their impact on fleet safety and regulatory processes will grow. More accurate and timely reviews mean resources can be directed where they re needed most, helping law enforcement focus on identifying fleets with real safety risks. For trucking companies, these advancements could mean a fairer, more efficient system that better reflects their actual safety performance. AI isn t replacing human judgment, but it is making the process of reviewing accident reports faster and more reliable. As AI capabilities continue to advance, fleet managers can expect more transparency and efficiency in how safety data is analyzed and used.

            "Discover how FMCSA safety ratings, SMS scores, and compliance strategies help fleets reduce risk, improve safety, maintain business viability.\n",
            "How FMCSA compliance and scoring drive safer operations. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , transportation incidents were the leading cause of workplace deaths in 2023. While that s disheartening news for people who work in the transportation industry, there is a silver lining. The BLS statistics show that truck driver deaths dropped 11.9 in a year, underscoring the progress that s been made with the help of safety technology. The numbers in the BLS report show that improving fleet safety isn t just about meeting regulatory requirements. It s about protecting drivers and others on the road. There are other benefits as well. By protecting people, companies can safeguard the public trust and ensure the long-term viability of their business. Key takeaways The decline in trucking fatalities likely stems from a combination of factors Increased use of safety technology. Adopting AI-powered dash cams , electronic logging devices ELDs , and real-time maintenance alerts has given fleet managers complete visibility into operations, alerting them to problems instantly, as they occur. Better fleet compliance . Fleets that proactively manage their FMCSA ratings and Safety Measurement System SMS scores avoid violations and improve their standing with regulators, customers, and insurers. Increased focus on the job . AI dash cams and modern driver apps give drivers greater visibility into unsafe driving habits, allowing them to self-correct and self-coach unsafe driving behaviors on their own time. In-person and remote coaching programs can address unsafe driving behaviors in more detail, instilling safer habits over the long term and building a stronger safety culture. However, the work of improving fleet safety, meeting regulatory requirements, and keeping drivers safe on the road is far from over. To sustain progress, fleets must improve continuously. Oftentimes, growth means prioritizing compliance and using technology to mitigate risk. Compliance programs are the cornerstone of any fleet safety program. In fact, the entire premise of fleet compliance is to facilitate safer outcomes. nbsp What is the FMCSA safety rating system? The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA safety rating is an official evaluation of a fleet s compliance with federal safety standards. Typically assigned after a compliance review, it rates safety as Satisfactory, Conditional, or Unsatisfactory. The rating is critical in determining not just a fleet s operating ability, but its reputation with customers, insurers, and regulators. The three ratings are broken down as follows Satisfactory . The highest rating indicates compliance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations FMCSRs and safety standards. Conditional . This rating raises red flags with shippers, brokers, insurers, and even quality drivers. It s a warning sign that your compliance is falling short. Unsatisfactory . This rating can be a death sentence for your business. It bars you from operating until your compliance issues are resolved. Fleets with conditional ratings often face higher insurance premiums, limited contract access, and difficulty retaining or recruiting drivers. The Beam Brothers Trucking case , in which hours-of-service violations led to criminal charges and the company s closure, is an example of a serious risk that can become a reality. Understanding SMS and CSA scores The FMCSA s Safety Measurement System SMS evaluates carriers in seven Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories BASICs , and assigns CSA scores based on roadside inspections, crashes, and violations. The categories are Unsafe Driving Hours of Service HOS Compliance Driver Fitness Controlled Substances Alcohol Vehicle Maintenance Hazardous Materials Compliance Crash Indicator Each category has thresholds that, when exceeded, put carriers in alert status, publicly flagging them as high-risk. Hours-of-service and unsafe driving violations are double-weighted, reflecting their direct correlation with crash risk. Exceeding thresholds in these categories can escalate quickly to a conditional or unsatisfactory rating, damaging your reputation and bottom line. Proposed 2023 changes to SMS scoring aim to simplify and clarify the process. They include consolidating violations, introducing proportionate percentiles to stabilize scores, and increasing thresholds for certain categories, such as Driver Fitness and Hazardous Materials . These changes underscore the FMCSA s focus on targeting high-risk behaviors and enhancing the accuracy of its scoring system. How FMCSA prioritizes enforcement Understanding how violations impact your standing with the FMCSA is part of doing business. Accumulating violations can place your fleet in alert status in one or more of the BASIC categories. When carriers exceed the established thresholds in any BASIC category, they re flagged with an alert symbol in the SMS, indicating they re a higher risk. This alert status is publicly visible and has several significant consequences Prioritized for Enforcement The FMCSA prioritizes interventions, including warning letters, investigations, and on-site audits, for carriers in alert status. Increased Roadside Inspections Law enforcement officers use this information to target carriers for roadside inspections. Impact on Business Relationships Shippers, brokers, and insurers monitor these alerts and may choose not to work with carriers flagged as high-risk. Understanding ISS scores Your roadside risk indicator The Inspection Selection System ISS score is another critical component affecting how often your vehicles are inspected on the road. The ISS ranges from 0 to 100 , and a higher score indicates a higher risk and a greater likelihood of being selected for inspection. This score is derived from your SMS data and other factors, providing enforcement personnel with a quick assessment tool. ISS Score Breakdown 0-49 Pass Vehicles are less likely to be inspected. 50-74 Optional Inspection is at the officer s discretion. 75-100 Inspect Vehicles are highly likely to be inspected. Every time your USDOT number is run at a weigh station or by enforcement, your ISS score influences their decision to inspect your vehicle. High ISS scores can lead to Increased Downtime . Frequent inspections slow operations, leading to delays and lost productivity. Higher Violation Risks . More inspections mean more opportunities for officers to find violations, which can further increase your SMS and ISS scores. Reputational Damage . High ISS scores signal to industry partners that your fleet may not prioritize safety and compliance. The vicious cycle of non-compliance Without proactive management, violations can create a self-perpetuating cycle Accumulating Violations . This leads to higher SMS scores and alert statuses. Higher ISS Scores . The result of poor SMS performance is an increase in roadside inspections. More Inspections . Increase the likelihood of discovering additional violations. Escalated Enforcement . FMCSA interventions have become more frequent and severe. Business Consequences. Loss of customers, higher insurance premiums, and potential operational shutdowns. When FMCSA takes immediate action The FMCSA s imminent hazard declaration is the nuclear option for immediately shutting down businesses and drivers who pose an immediate risk to public safety. This declaration often follows major violations, such as egregious hours-of-service HOS issues, falsified logs, or a pattern of severe crashes. Once labeled an imminent hazard, reopening is costly, time-consuming, and often impossible. Staying compliant with FMCSRs isn t just about meeting legal requirements. It s about preventing your fleet or drivers from becoming a danger to themselves and others. The consequences of poor FMCSA scores and ratings Poor CSA safety scores and ratings can have a ripple effect across your business. Here are some of the most notable impacts Insurance Non-Renewal or Higher Premiums . Unsafe fleets are a liability for insurers, leading to skyrocketing costs or outright cancellations. Lost Customers . Shippers and brokers rely on SMS data to evaluate carrier safety. A conditional or unsatisfactory rating often means lost contracts. Driver Turnover . Quality drivers prefer to work for compliant, safety-focused carriers. High scores and poor ratings lead to driver attrition. Increased Regulatory Scrutiny . FMCSA prioritizes interventions for carriers with poor scores, increasing the likelihood of audits, fines, and shutdowns. Data Q challenges, safety management plans, and rating upgrades The FMCSA allows carriers to challenge incorrect data through Data Q challenges , which can rectify errors in crash reports, inspections, or violations. Filing successful challenges requires detailed documentation and an understanding of the FMCSA s process. For carriers with conditional or unsatisfactory ratings, submitting a Safety Management Plan SMP and a rating upgrade request is often the only path back to full operational status. These plans outline corrective actions to address deficiencies, from implementing new training programs to upgrading vehicle maintenance processes. The road back to compliance can be long and expensive without a proactive approach. Proactive compliance The key to staying in business Proactive compliance is far more cost-effective than rebuilding your business after a shutdown, catastrophic injury, or fatality. The FMCSA s New Entrant Program educates carriers on the regulations and processes necessary to operate safely, yet too many fleets fail to take these lessons to heart. Compliance isn t optional. It s the foundation of a sustainable business model that helps you meet your moral and ethical obligations while sharing the road. Reduce risk and improve compliance with Motive Motive s ecosystem of compliance tools empowers fleets to manage every aspect of their operations efficiently and effectively.

            "Cargo theft is at an all-time high, and trucking companies are feeling the impact. Just ask Adam Blanchard, CEO of Double Diamond Transportation amp Tanager Logistics, who recently testified before Congress about the alarming rise in cargo theft . His message was clear when his company became the target of sophisticated criminals, it felt like they were left to fend for themselves. Blanchard s story is just one of many. Cargo theft has skyrocketed by 1,500 since 2021 , with the industry losing 35 billion annually . Thieves are becoming more sophisticated, using identity fraud to steal shipments and manipulate carrier records. Even worse, law enforcement agencies often lack the resources or jurisdiction to intervene, leaving businesses scrambling for solutions. But here s the good news you re not on your own. While law enforcement catches up, technology is already helping businesses fight back. Technology is the best defense against cargo theft At Motive, we ve seen firsthand how AI-powered security solutions prevent theft and recover stolen cargo in hours not months. In a world where thieves are getting smarter, businesses need real-time visibility and automated prevention to stay ahead. wistia-player media-id yihneqw2dx not defined background center contain no-repeat url https fast.wistia.com embed medias yihneqw2dx swatch display block filter blur 5px padding-top 56.25 How AI-powered security stops cargo theft Real-time GPS tracking Know where your cargo is at all times with GPS tracking . If theft occurs, recover stolen assets faster by pinpointing exact locations. Case in point A trucking company using Motive recovered stolen vehicles within hours , compared to an eight-month delay with a previous provider.

Thanks to the Motive Vehicle Gateway, I started tracking the van while I was on the phone with the San Jose Police Department. We were able to track it and recover it. Jon Fontaine, Corporate Fleet Manager Businesses are fighting back and winning Blanchard s testimony highlights the urgent need for legislative action and better law enforcement coordination. But until those changes happen, technology offers a proven way to prevent theft and protect businesses. Companies that once faced devastating losses have completely transformed their security approach with AI-powered solutions. In the construction industry , GPS tracking helped recover 5 million in stolen equipment , proving that investing in technology pays for itself in theft prevention alone.

            "How claims handling, review committees, and technology work together to protect your fleet. When a commercial vehicle crash occurs, the steps a fleet takes in the immediate aftermath can significantly impact financial and operational outcomes. Managing a claim effectively starts with timely evidence collection, a structured review process, and a focus on learning from the incident to reduce future risk. At the center of this approach is the accident committee, a critical team that evaluates crashes for preventability and identifies opportunities for improvement . However, to make the accident review process seamless, fleets need tools to preserve, consolidate, and access crash-related evidence. That s where the Motive platform comes into play. With dash cam footage , vehicle diagnostics , and document storage at your fingertips, crash reviews become more streamlined, objective, and actionable. Anatomy of a crash From impact to action The foundation of effective claims management The claims management process begins the moment a crash occurs. Timely and accurate data collection is essential to achieving the best possible outcome for claims mitigation. Motive s real-time collision detection notifies fleet managers immediately, signaling the need to start preserving evidence. Dash cam and AI Omnicam footage captures what happens before, during, and after the incident, providing a clear, unbiased timeline. This high-definition video is paired with GPS data, speed readings, and vehicle diagnostics, creating a complete picture of every incident. When fleets act quickly to collect this evidence and store it on the Motive platform, they can improve their ability to manage claims, reduce disputes, and mitigate costs. For instance, video footage often resolves liability disputes in minutes. Instead of relying on secondhand accounts or incomplete details, insurers and claims managers have concrete proof of what occurred, ensuring quicker claim resolution. The accident committee The best fleets rely on structured, objective processes. That s where an Accident Committee comes into play. While not all fleets have accident committees, those that do consistently achieve better safety outcomes. The accident committee sits at the heart of the post-crash review process. While determining fault is often a legal issue, accident committees focus on preventability with a collision avoidance focus. The key question they ask is Did the driver operate proactively, anticipating the actions of others and taking steps to avoid the collision? This perspective reframes the conversation, pushing fleets to focus on driver behavior, situational awareness, and proactive decision-making. A well-run accident committee creates a culture where the goal isn t just to avoid fault but to avoid collisions altogether. When the committee meets, Motive simplifies the process by serving as a centralized repository for all crash-related data Dash cam video and vehicle diagnostics provide clarity on driver actions. Inspection and maintenance records highlight any potential equipment issues. Reports and witness statements can be uploaded and reviewed within the platform. This evidence allows the committee to analyze the root causes of a crash, identify patterns, and prescribe specific actions such as coaching, retraining, or recognition of positive driver behavior. Coach drivers virtually wistia-player media-id qvfk6d4kz4 not defined background center contain no-repeat url https fast.wistia.com embed medias qvfk6d4kz4 swatch display block filter blur 5px padding-top 56.25 Preserving evidence best practices Claims management has a legal element that fleets cannot ignore. Accident committees must operate carefully, as discoverable meeting minutes can be used in litigation. It s important to involve legal counsel early to guide evidence preservation, discussions, and documentation. The Motive platform helps fleets comply with legal best practices by preserving critical crash evidence in a secure, centralized system. With footage, reports, and documents easily accessible, fleets are better prepared to defend themselves in claims while demonstrating a proactive commitment to safety. Countermeasures and continuous improvement The most valuable outcome of an accident committee review is the implementation of preventative countermeasures . For crashes found to be preventable, the committee prescribes actions to reduce risk going forward. The Motive platform provides critical insights that help fleets identify trends and improve safety. For example Dash cam footage can reveal recurring issues like distracted driving or poor following distances. Views from the Motive AI Omnicam provide a broader collision perspective, showing blind spots and situational challenges. Maintenance tracking and electronic DVIRs highlight equipment-related risks that may need attention. These insights help safety managers develop targeted coaching program s and preventive measures, such as defensive driving training or route planning improvements. When paired with Motive s behavioral coaching tools, fleets can correct unsafe behaviors before they result in future crashes. For incidents where drivers demonstrated commendable actions such as evasive maneuvers or defensive driving, recognition and positive reinforcement are equally critical. Celebrating safe driving behaviors builds a culture of accountability and improvement. The claims process Effective claims handling depends on speed, quality, and accuracy. The faster evidence is collected, preserved, and shared with insurers, the better the outcome. Motive ensures that fleets have everything they need, whether it s dash cam video, vehicle data, or inspection reports, the moment they need it. By acting quickly, fleets can mitigate claim costs, reduce settlement times, and minimize liability exposure. Claims managers gain confidence knowing they have an organized, reliable system to access critical data, giving their teams a strategic advantage in handling claims effectively. Sentry Insurance Here s how to lower your premiums. Elevating crash management with structure and technology Accidents happen, but how a fleet responds can make all the difference. Accident committees provide a structured, proactive way to evaluate crashes, focusing on preventability and continuous improvement. Motive enhances this process by acting as a digital evidence locker, preserving crash data, simplifying claims management, and empowering fleets to learn from every incident. For more efficient claims management, harness the power of the Motive platform . Protect your fleet, lower costs, and prevent future incidents. nbsp\n",

            "Enhance fleet safety, compliance, and efficiency with Motive s digital DVIRs streamlining inspections, maintenance, and real-time visibility for drivers.\n",
            "A Driver-Vehicle Inspection Report DVIR isn t just a piece of paper or a checkbox. It s a daily inspection report that drivers must complete before and after each trip. DVIRs allow drivers to document the condition of the vehicle and note when a defect is discovered. More than just paperwork, the DVIR serves as a critical communication tool that connects drivers directly with fleet maintenance and fleet management teams, ensuring that vehicles remain safe, compliant, and road-ready. Here s why an effective DVIR process is so important Awareness of vehicle condition. Drivers spend the most time with their vehicles, making them uniquely qualified to notice unusual scents, sounds, or vibrations that could indicate a deeper issue. Prevention through detection. Early detection of issues can prevent breakdowns or accidents. For example, a driver noting unusual tire wear during a pre-trip inspection can save the fleet from downtime and expensive roadside repairs. Regulatory compliance. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration mandates that DVIRs include the signatures of three key individuals The driver who conducted the inspection. The mechanic or manager certifying the repair or noting no defects. The next driver to operate the vehicle post repair, confirming the repair or acknowledgment before the vehicle goes back into service. These signatures ensure transparency and accountability, protecting fleets from non-compliance penalties. How Motive s digital DVIRs enhance the inspection process Switching from paper-based to digital DVIRs offers advantages that save time, improve accuracy, and create actionable data. Motive elevates DVIRs to a whole new level with features like these Streamlined Pre- and Post-Trip Inspections .

            "In today s wild insurance market, fleets face rising premiums, unpredictable claims, and little control over their risk exposure. Captive insurance offers a different solution for fleets seeking stability, transparency, and potential financial savings. Unlike traditional insurance, captives engage and empower members to manage risk, improve their safety culture, and proactively reduce claims. With great opportunity comes great accountability. Fleets that underperform, especially in safety and compliance, can negatively impact other members, increasing costs and threatening the viability of the captive group. That s where Motive technology comes into play. From electronic Driver Vehicle Inspection Reports to maintenance tracking , Motive helps fleets stay compliant, reduce risk, and become valuable members of their captives. nbsp Improve performance and lower your rates with AI dash cams. What is captive insurance? Captive insurance is an alternative to traditional insurance. In this type of insurance, group members own and operate their insurance company. Unlike standard insurers, captives are designed to benefit their members not external shareholders by returning unused premiums as dividends and promoting safety-focused practices. Key benefits of group insurance captives include Lower Premiums Traditional insurance premiums are often based on broad market averages and industry trends, meaning that even well-performing fleets can face higher costs due to other companies actions. Captive insurance, however, determines premiums based on its members loss history and risk profile, ensuring that safety-conscious fleets receive lower, more predictable costs. Enhanced Risk Control Unlike conventional insurance policies, which offer limited customization, captive programs allow fleets to manage their risk actively. Members work collaboratively to implement effective safety programs, enforce accountability measures, and create a culture of continuous improvement. Profit Sharing In a captive program, insurance premiums aren t simply absorbed by an external provider. Instead, unused funds are returned to members as dividends, reinforcing the importance of strong risk management. Fleets that successfully reduce claims can directly benefit from lower costs and financial rewards. Custom Coverage Options Unlike standard insurance, which provides generic coverage, captives offer tailored policies that align with the unique needs of trucking fleets. Coverage options often include auto liability, cargo insurance, and general liability, ensuring members receive protection relevant to their specific operational risks. Why accountability matters in captive groups Captive insurance programs function as shared-risk models, meaning that each member s behavior impacts the group. If one fleet experiences excessive claims due to poor safety practices, it can drive up costs for everyone. This structure incentivizes members to maintain high safety and compliance standards, as failure could result in increased premiums or even removal from the program. Fleets that consistently underperform in accident prevention , compliance , and driver safety may be placed in an Alert Status. This designation requires fleets to work closely with risk control consultants to implement corrective measures and improve overall performance. If safety improvements aren t made, fleets risk being expelled from the captive, losing access to cost-saving opportunities and financial returns. Improving safety and compliance to stay competitive To remain in good standing and unlock the financial benefits of captive insurance, fleets should adopt a proactive approach to safety and risk management. This includes Reducing accidents and violations .Implementing robust coaching programs and leveraging visibility tools can help fleets identify risky behavior before it leads to exposure. Regular driver training, AI-driven coaching tools, and real-time visibility into fleet operations are essential for reducing violations and enhancing safety performance. nbsp Optimizing maintenance programs to prevent costly breakdowns. Preventive maintenance is crucial to avoiding expensive breakdowns and violations. Fleets should establish a structured maintenance plan and policy to ensure that fleet assets remain roadworthy. Preventive maintenance programs reduce the risk of unexpected failures and expensive repairs. nbsp Ensuring compliance with FMCSA regulations like DVIRs and annual inspections. Meeting FMCSA requirements such as Daily Vehicle Inspection Reports DVIRs and competing federal annual inspections is critical for maintaining optimal standing with regulators. Failure in these areas can lead to penalties, higher insurance costs, alert status in the captive, and removal from the captive. nbsp How Motive supports captive members with a proactive risk management solution Building a strong predictive maintenance program Preventive and predictive maintenance starts with accurate, detailed, and consistent vehicle inspections. Motive enhances compliance by capturing signatures from drivers, mechanics, and fleet managers, ensuring that inspections align with FMCSA standards. By documenting every step clearly and digitally, Motive simplifies audits and provides valuable insights through historical inspection data. This level of transparency and record-keeping helps fleets demonstrate proactive compliance, identify recurring issues early, and make data-driven decisions to improve maintenance strategies.

            "Tariffs on imports could raise fleet costs, disrupt supply chains, and reshape trade. See how businesses can adapt to an evolving economic landscape.\n",
            "From the start of his presidency, Donald Trump took swift action through a series of executive orders. Among the economic measures he supports are tariffs, which he sees as a key tool for addressing trade imbalances. One of his recent decisions placing a 25 tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10 tariff on imports from China stands to impact the transportation industry significantly. In another executive action, he announced a plan for reciprocal tariffs across the world to help correct imbalances in international trade. How tariffs could increase fleet costs According to the American Trucking Associations ATA , these tariffs could lead to higher costs for new trucks, potentially adding 35,000 to the price of a new vehicle. This surge in equipment costs could deter fleet expansions and renewals, affecting the industry s capacity to meet freight demands . It could also disrupt supply chains, leading to delays in material delivery and impacting project timelines. Existing contracts might not include provisions for cost adjustments due to tariffs, leaving owners and contractors to negotiate how to handle these unexpected expenses. More from David O Neal What Trump s win means for trucking. The ripple effect on transportation and logistics Given the interconnectivity of supply chains across the world, the unpredictability of these actions makes it difficult for transportation companies to plan effectively, leading to potential disruptions in hiring, pricing, and service offerings. nbsp In turn, these disruptions could result in higher transportation costs. Higher costs would have short-term impacts on businesses and consumers and longer term impacts on supply chains. Businesses that rely heavily on imports would likely have a hard time adjusting to the new costs, potentially passing those expenses onto consumers. Could tariffs benefit U.S. manufacturing? However, some analysts argue that tariffs could have positive long-term effects on the U.S. economy. By encouraging more domestic production, these policies may lead to increased manufacturing within the United States in some sectors, creating jobs and boosting demand for domestically produced equipment. If domestic production expands, the transportation industry could benefit from increased freight demand, particularly in sectors such as trucking, rail, and logistics. While the short-term impact may be challenging, some see an opportunity for growth and resilience in the long run.Distinguishing rhetoric from reality is the hard part. How much of this is idle threat versus intended policy? While some tariffs have gone into effect, others have been threatened and pulled back. Adapting to a shifting trade landscape The ongoing ambiguity requires stakeholders to closely monitor developments and consider real-time adjustments to mitigate potential adverse effects. They also have to make longer-term supply chain assessments to ensure that consumer demands can be met. nbsp Staying agile in both short-term responses and long-term planning will be critical for maintaining stability and competitiveness in this evolving trade landscape.

            "Coaching drivers is critical to safety but it s hard to scale. Reviewing events, running coaching sessions, and tracking improvement takes 30 minutes per driver, on average, making it tough to proactively coach everyone. Motive already saves you time with the most accurate AI , expert video review , and Driver App coaching. nbsp Together, these tools cut coaching time by 31 , saving managers 10 hours a week by filtering out false positives. nbsp Until now, drivers could review events and self-coach in the Driver App, but managers still had to manually mark those events as coached after drivers reviewed creating extra work. There was also no standardized training for common safety issues. Now you have both. With new customizable self-coaching behaviors and built-in training videos coming in early April, you can easily scale coaching without adding to your workload. Decide which behaviors drivers can self-coach Now you can choose which behaviors drivers can self-coach, allowing you to set coaching policies that align with your fleet s safety goals. Safety events remain visible to both drivers and managers, but self-coachable events are now automatically marked as Coached once reviewed in the Driver App no manager action needed. Drivers have one week to review events before a coaching session with the manager is required. nbsp Many fleets enable self-coaching for lower priority behaviors. As a result, they can focus coaching on more serious violations, such as cell phone usage.

With this update, you now have access to a complete visual record of every trip, helping you gain better insights into fleet activity. Motive already provides video footage throughout the trip and images from safety events. Now, with Trip Images, fleet operators have a more comprehensive view by displaying the full volume of images captured by your dash cams. These images are available directly within the Vehicle and Driver History pages, giving you a more detailed and contextual understanding of every trip. A more complete view of every trip With this enhancement, you can now view available images from your dash cams, including road-facing, driver-facing, and other camera angles. This means you can access a continuous stream of images that offer deeper insights into daily operations. To make navigation even easier, Trip Images is fully integrated into the timeline at the bottom of the page. As you move the scrubber along the timeline, the displayed image updates in real time, reflecting the exact moment in the trip. Whether you re analyzing a full day s worth of driving or a specific trip, you can seamlessly review images alongside vehicle data for greater context. Quick access to important visuals For a faster and more intuitive experience, hovering over the playback bar or map trail will now display a preview of images at any given point. If you need a closer look, clicking on any image will open an expanded view, complete with a time stamp, allowing for more detailed inspections. How this helps your fleet Motive s Trip Images feature unlocks new levels of visibility, making it easier than ever to monitor fleet activity and verify job completion. Whether you re ensuring that deliveries were made on time, reviewing unexpected stops, or investigating a safety event, the ability to see a complete sequence of images provides clarity and confidence in your decision-making. For safety managers, this feature strengthens incident investigations by offering a more complete picture. Instead of relying on a single image or video clip from a safety event, you can now review surrounding images to better understand what happened before, during, and after an incident. This additional context helps teams take more informed corrective actions and resolve disputes more effectively. Enterprise customers, particularly those in field services, will find Trip Images invaluable for job verification. Having a visual record of service visits, site arrivals, and task completion reduces disputes, improves accountability, and enhances customer satisfaction. A smarter way to manage your fleet With Motive Fleet Management , you can review detailed trip history, analyze vehicle paths, and see trip images to confirm stops and investigate events with confidence. In addition to trip images, our Fleet Management platform allows you to track fuel levels, RPM, and speed at each point in time, helping you detect unusual activity and optimize fleet performance. For those using Motive Reefer Monitoring , trip images can also provide critical proof of conditions inside temperature-controlled trailers along the route. By providing instant access to visual evidence, Trip Images empowers fleets with the insights they need to operate more efficiently, reduce disputes, and improve safety outcomes.

The system automatically reviews videos, determining severity and filtering out noise.  This information feeds into Motive's built-in coaching workflows, allowing you to see which drivers have coachable events, tag them with different coaching statuses, and leave notes for them in the app.  Automated coaching helps escalate top-priority items immediately, even if the driver isn't back at the office for weeks, allowing for later, in-person reinforcement.  A driver scorecard evaluates performance based on specific metrics, helping prioritize drivers needing coaching.  Motive's DRIVE risk score benchmarks behavior across a large network of vehicles for an objective measure of driver risk, and helps predict accidents more accurately than industry-leading safety scores.  Finally, video and statistics can be used to help drivers understand the consequences of high-risk behaviors.\n",
